# GROBID software-mentions module

[![License](http://img.shields.io/:license-apache-blue.svg)](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)

__Work in progress.__

The goal of this GROBID module is to recognize in textual documents and PDF any mentions of software.   

As the other GROBID models, the module relies only on machine learning and can use linear CRF (via [Wapiti](https://github.com/kermitt2/Wapiti) JNI integration) or Deep Learning model such as BiLSTM-CRF with or without ELMo (via [DeLFT](https://github.com/kermitt2/delft) JNI integration). 

A description of the task and some preliminary evaluations can be found [here](doc/description.md).

Latest performance (accuracy and runtime) can be found [below](https://github.com/Impactstory/software-mentions#Benchmarking).

## Install, build, run

Building module requires maven and JDK 1.8.  

First install and build the latest development version of GROBID as explained by the [documentation](http://grobid.readthedocs.org).

Copy the module software-mentions as sibling sub-project to grobid-core, grobid-trainer, etc.:

> cp -r software-mentions grobid/

Copy the provided pre-trained model in the standard grobid-home path:

> cd grobid/software-mentions/

> ./gradlew copyModels 

Try compiling everything with:

> ./gradlew clean install 

Run some test: 

> ./gradlew clean test


## Start the service

> ./gradlew clean appRun

Javascript demo/console web app is then accessible at ```http://localhost:8060```. From the console and the `RESTfull services` tab, you can process chunk of text (select `ProcessText`) or process a complete PDF document (select `Annotate PDF document`).

Using ```curl``` POST/GET requests with some text:

```
curl -X POST -d "text=The next step is to install GROBID version 0.5.4." localhost:8060/processSoftwareText
```

which should return this:

```json
{
    "entities": [{
        "software-name": {
            "rawForm": "GROBID",
            "offsetStart": 28,
            "offsetEnd": 34
        },
        "type": "software",
        "version-number": {
            "rawForm": "version 0.5.4",
            "offsetStart": 35,
            "offsetEnd": 48
        }
    }],
    "runtime": 2
}
```

```
curl -GET --data-urlencode "text=The final step is to update GROBID version 0.5.5." localhost:8060/processSoftwareText
```

Using ```curl``` POST/PUT requests with a PDF file:

```bash
curl --form input=@./thefile.pdf localhost:8060/annotateSoftwarePDF
```

Runtimes are expressed in milliseconds.

### Accuracy

Evaluation made on 03.10.2019

The results (Precision, Recall, F-score) for all the models have been obtained using 10-fold cross-validation (average metrics over the 10 folds). We also indicate the best and worst results over the 10 folds in the [complete result page](https://github.com/Impactstory/software-mentions/blob/master/doc/scores-1.0.txt). 

`<software>` label means “software name”. `<creator>` corresponds usually to the publisher of the software or, more rarely, the main developer. `<version>` correspond to both version number and version dates, when available. 

|Labels | CRF ||| BiLSTM-CRF ||| BiLSTM-CRF+ELMo|||
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---| --- | --- |
|Metrics | Precision | Recall | f-score | Precision | Recall | f-score | Precision | Recall | f-score|
| `<software>` | 86.5 | 72.24 | 78.67 | 79.70 | 75.21 | 77.37 | 86.87 | 80.72 | 83.63|
| `<creator>` | 85.45 | 74.84 | 79.72 | 77.57 | 82.48 | 79.94 | 86.40 | 87.81 | 87.07|
| `<version>`  | 89.65 | 84.99 | 87.14 | 88.55 | 90.57 | 89.55 | 89.61 | 89.07 | 89.33|
| `<url>`  | 69.19 | 63.35 | 65.03 | 28.22 | 36.00 | 31.36 | 61.38 | 64.00 | 62.19|
|micro-average | 82.7 | 73.85 | 77.64 | 79.62 | 78.59 | 79.09 | 86.72 | 83.14 | 84.87|

### Runtimes

|CRF || BiLSTM-CRF || BiLSTM-CRF+ELMo||
|--- | --- | --- |--- | ---| --- |
|threads | tokens/s | batch size | tokens/s | batch size | tokens/s|
|1 | 23,685 | 50 | 24,774 | 5 | 271|
|2 | 43,281|
|3 | 59,867 | 100 | 28,707 | 7 | 365|
|4 | 73,339|
|6 | 92,385 | 150 | 30,247|
|7 | 97,659|
|8 | 100,879 | 200 | 30,520|

Batch size is a parameter constrained by the capacity of the available GPU. An improvement of the performance of the deep learning architecture requires increasing the number of GPU and the amount of memory of these GPU, similarly as improving CRF capacity requires increasing the number of available threads and CPU. Running a Deep Learning architectures on CPU is around 50 times slower than on GPU (although it depends on the amount of RAM available with the CPU, which can allow to increase the batch size significantly).

## Training and evaluation

### Training only

For training the software model with all the available training data:

```
> cd PATH-TO-GROBID/grobid/software-mentions/

> ./gradlew train_software 
```

The training data must be under ```software-mentions/resources/dataset/software/corpus```. 



### Training and evaluating with automatic corpus split

The following commands will split automatically and randomly the available annotated data (under ```resources/dataset/software/corpus/```) into a training set and an evaluation set, train a model based on the first set and launch an evaluation based on the second set. 

```
>  ./gradlew eval_software_split [-PgH=/custom/grobid/home -Ps=0.8 -Pt=10] 
```

In this mode, by default, 90% of the available data is used for training and the remaining for evaluation. This default ratio can be changed with the parameter `-Ps`. By default, the training will use the available number of threads of the machine, but it can also be specified by the parameter `-Pt`. The grobid home can be optionally specified with parameter `-PgH`. By default it will take `../grobid-home`. 

### Evaluation with n-fold

For n-fold evaluation using the available annotated data (under ```resources/dataset/software/corpus/```), use the command:

```
>  ./gradlew eval_software_nfold [-PgH=/path/grobid/home -n=10 -Pt=10]
```

where `n` is the parameter for the number of folds, by default 10. Still by default, the training will use the available number of threads of the machine, but it can also be specified by the parameter `-Pt`. The grobid home can be optionally specified with parameter `-PgH`. By default it will take `../grobid-home`. 

### Evaluating only

For evaluating under the labeled data under ```grobid-astro/resources/dataset/software/evaluation``` (fixed "holdout set" approach), use the command:

```
>  ./gradlew eval_software [-PgH=/path/grobid/home]
```

The grobid home can be optionally specified with parameter `-PgH`. By default it will take `../grobid-home`  

## Training data import

### Assembling the softcite dataset

The source of training data is the [softcite dataset](https://github.com/howisonlab/softcite-dataset) developed by [James Howison](http://james.howison.name/) Lab at the University of Texas at Austin. The data need to be compiled with actual PDF content preliminary to training in order to create XML annotated document (MUC conference style). This is done with the following command which takes 3 arguments: 

```
> ./gradlew annotated_corpus_generator_csv -Ppdf=/path/input/pdf -Pcsv=path/csv -Poutput=/output/directory
```

The path to the PDF repo is the path where the PDF corresponding to the annotated document will be downloaded (done only the first time). For instance:

```
> ./gradlew annotated_corpus_generator_csv -Ppdf=/home/lopez/repository/softcite-dataset/pdf/ -Pcsv=/home/lopez/tools/softcite-dataset/data/csv_dataset/ -Poutput=resources/dataset/software/corpus/
```

The compiled XML training files will be written in the standard GROBID training path for the softwate recognition model under `grobid/software-mentions/resources/dataset/software/corpus/`.

### Inter-Annotator Agreement measures

The import process includes the computation of standard Inter-Annotator Agreement (__IIA__) measures for the documents being annotated by at least two annotators. For the moment, the reported IIA is a percentage agreement measure, with standard error and confidence interval.  

See this nice [tutorial](https://dkpro.github.io/dkpro-statistics/inter-rater-agreement-tutorial.pdf) about IIA. We might need more sophisticated IIA measures than just percentage agreement for more robustness. We plan, in addition to pourcentage agreement, to also cover various IIA metrics from π, κ, and α families using the [dkpro-statistics-agreement](https://dkpro.github.io/dkpro-statistics/) library:

Christian M. Meyer, Margot Mieskes, Christian Stab, and Iryna Gurevych: [DKPro Agreement: An Open-Source Java Library for Measuring Inter-Rater Agreement](https://dkpro.github.io/dkpro-statistics/dkpro-agreement-poster.pdf), in: Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING), pp. 105–109, August 2014. Dublin, Ireland. 

For explanations on these IIA measures, see: 

Artstein, R., & Poesio, M. (2008). [Inter-coder agreement for computational linguistics](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/coli.07-034-R2). Computational Linguistics, 34(4), 555-596.

## Analysis of training data consistency

A Python 3.* script is available under `script/` to analyse XML training data and spot possible unconsistencies to review. To launch the script: 

```
> python3 scripts/consistency.py _absolute_path_to_training_directory_
```

For instance: 


```
> python3 scripts/consistency.py /home/lopez/grobid/software-mentions/resources/dataset/software/corpus/
```

See the description of the output directly in the header of the `script/consistency.py` file. 


## Generation of training data

For generating training data in XML/TEI, based on the current model, from a list of text or PDF files in a input repository, use the following command: 

```
> java -Xmx4G -jar target/software-mentions/-0.5.1-SNAPSHOT.onejar.jar -gH ../grobid-home -dIn ~/test_software/ -dOut ~/test_software/out/ -exe createTraining
```

## Runtime benchmark

A python script is available for benchmarking the services. The main motivation is to evaluation the runtime of the different machine learning models from an end-to-end perspective and on a similar hardware. 

By default, the text content for the benchmark is taken from the xml files from the training/eval directory under `resources/dataset/software/corpus`, to call the script for evaluation the text processing service:

```bash
> cd scripts/
> python3 runtime_eval.py
software-mention server is up and running
1000 texts to process
1000 texts to process
317 texts to process
-----------------------------
nb xml files: 1
nb texts: 2317
nb tokens: 962875
-----------------------------
total runtime: 38.769 seconds 
-----------------------------
xml files/s:     0.0258
    texts/s:     59.7642
   tokens/s:     24836.2093
```

In the above example, 24,836 tokens per second is the processing rate of the CRF model with 1 thread (it goes beyond 100K tokens per second with 8 threads). 

optionally you can provide a path to a particular repository of XML files in order to benchmark the text processing processing:

> python3 runtime_eval.py --xml-repo /my/xml/directory/

For benchmarking PDF processing, you need to provide a path to a repository of PDF in order to benchmark PDF processing:

> python3 runtime_eval.py --pdf-repo /the/path/to/the/pdf/directory

By default the config file `./config.json` will be used, but you can also set a particular config file with the parameter `--config`:

> python3 runtime_eval.py --config ./my_config.json

The config file gives the hostname and port of the software-mention service to be used. Default values are service default values (localhost:8060).

Last but not least, you can indicate the number of thread to be used for querying the service in parallel:

> python3 runtime_eval.py --threads 10

The default value is 1, so there is no parallelization in the call to the service by default.  

Tested with python 3.*

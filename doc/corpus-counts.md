number of documents: __4984__

__raw annotation runs__: sum of all annotations from all annotators (include multiple annotations for some documents)

__raw annotation largest runs__: sum of all annotations keeping for multiple annotated documents only the annotations of the most productive annotator (most productive for this specific document)

__annotations located in PDF__: annotations that could be matched with the PDF content as extracted, cleaned and structured by Grobid

__software entity annotations__: a software entity can include several annotations to specify the software entity (_software name_, _software version_, _software publisher_ and _url_).

Note: we considered only _software_ annotations and excluded other type of annotations like _reference_ or _algorithm_ annotations.

The column scores (the fraction of entirely correct columns) were  reported  in  addition to Q-scores  for  BAliBASE 3.0. Wilcoxon  signed-ranks  tests  were  performed  to  calculate statistical significance  of  comparisons  between  alignment programs,   which   include   ProbCons   (version   1.10) (23), MAFFT (version 5.667) (11) with several options, MUSCLE (version 3.52) (10) and ClustalW (version 1.83) (7). 

Sequences were further annotated with PERL scripts using BioPerl libraries (21) together with data and libraries from Ensemble (22) (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Perl scripts 1-3). Repetitive sequences were identified using repeatmasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org). Spike control amplicons were prepared by PCR from DNA extracted from normal blood. 

All statistical analyses were done using computer software Prism 6 for Windows (version 6.02; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). One-Way ANOVA was used to detect differences amongst the groups. To account for the non-normal distribution of the data, all data were sorted by rank status prior to ANOVA statistical analysis. 

The statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics v. 20 (SPSS Inc, 2003, Chicago, USA).

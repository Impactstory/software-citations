PMC1747177	http://rnai.dkfz.de	The GenomeRNAi database provides access to published RNAi phenotypes obtained from cellbased screens and maps them to their genomic locus, including possible non-specific regions. The database also gives access to sequence information of RNAi probes used in various screens. It can be searched by phenotype, by gene, by RNAi probe or by sequence and is accessible at http://rnai.dkfz.de	mention match but not in indicated page or quote

PMC2447753	http://bioinfo.lifl.fr/magnolia	Inthis perspective, MAGNOLIA is especially designedfor sequences that are intended to be either protein-coding or structural RNAs. It extracts informationfrom the similarities and differences in the data, andsearches for a specific evolutionary pattern betweensequences before aligning them. The alignment stepthen incorporates this information to achieve higheraccuracy. The website is available at http://bioinfo.lifl.fr/magnolia.	mention match but not in indicated page or quote

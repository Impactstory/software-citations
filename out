>             <p>Electronic Health Records (EHR) represent the central pillar of eHealth strategies worldwide, since they offer the capacity to support patient care, quality improvement, population health surveillance and research. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Until recently the topics of EHR and 'Consumer Health Informatics' tended to be considered separately; discussions of the former being mainly centred on healthcare institutions. Across North America and Europe there has been a gradual realization of the synergies between these two areas, manifested in the growing attention that is being paid to Personal Health Records (PHR) in both the scientific and policy literatures. The PHR is a complex construct and many have bemoaned the lack of consensus on its precise definition. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The central feature is a patient-accessible Electronic Health Record, although models vary in the source and controller of the information (healthcare provider or patient; single or multiple providers), the medium (e.g. web, kiosk, USB) and the additional functionalities associated with the software (e.g. education, prescription reordering, provider messaging, decision support). <ref type="bibr">4,5</ref> This report is concerned with one particular aspect of the PHR concept, namely online access by patients to provider-generated information that is specific to their health history and current conditions, and held in the computer systems of primary healthcare centres. We refer to this as Record Access, in line with the language adopted in recent guidelines from the Royal College of General Practitioners, <ref type="bibr">6</ref> although similar applications have also been characterised as 'tethered Personal Health Records'. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The idea of patients accessing their own health records is not a new one. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> However, the accessibility afforded by the Internet, and the capacity of emerging PHR to integrate personal health applications with provider-owned record systems, creates interesting new challenges and research questions.</p>

>             <p>The routine is implemented in Java using the supplied pseudo random number generator and the transformation function Ijava.util.Random.next The two generated artificial datasets differ by the ratio f, the mean p, and the variance B . The first dataset shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>B was generated at constant a=O.l*p for all combinations of f=l/16, l/s, 114 and p=0.5, 1.0, 1.5. The second dataset discussed in Tables 1 and 2 was generated with constant constant B = p, and varying f=l/256 to 1/4. Simply, the first dataset creates ever larger perturbations (with increasing f ) at ever larger distance to a=O (with increasing p ) with a constant and small variance of the perturbation. The second dataset creates exponentially increasing perturbations (with increasing f ) at a constant distance to a=O with a constant and large variance.</p>

>             <p>Here we describe a publicly accessible database to integrate annotation of RNAi reagents and functional information obtained from large-scale RNAi experiments. The database allows the user to access phenotype data from published screens and the sequences of their underlying perturbation reagents. Specificity and other sequence features are displayed in the context of the genomic location of the targeted gene model. GenomeRNAi also facilitates the design of new experiments, using previously designed RNAi reagents from independent libraries and links to a design program of RNAi constructs for independent retests <ref type="bibr">(13)</ref>. The database structure is flexible and allows adding large-scale cell-based phenotypic datasets from other organisms once they become available.</p>
4978a4983
>             <p>RNAi phenotypes of large-scale screens from our own lab and all to-date published screens were curated from the author's websites or the Supplementary Data. To date, the database contains 24 genome-scale screens which were performed with different genome-wide and subset RNAi libraries. A total of 5436 phenotypes are currently stored in GenomeRNAi, which will be expanded as more data becomes available. Phenotype frequency varies among the screens from 23 to &gt;1000 hits per screen. A list of all currently available screens can be accessed at http://www.dkfz.de/signaling/ screens/.</p>
4981a4987,4988
>             <p>Through these pages, the database provides gene annotation by comparing phenotypes in the light of the sequence content of probes targeting the gene of interest. Furthermore, individual gene models are linked to external databases such as FlyBase and FLIGHT for other functional information. A link to E-RNAi <ref type="bibr">(13)</ref> is provided to allow a direct redesign of independent RNAi probes.</p>
>             <p>The GenomeRNAi database presents phenotype information of large-scale screens in the context of associated sequence information. We believe that this is an important issuesince in contrast to genetic mutants, RNAi phenotypes depend on the specificity of the used siRNAs or dsRNAs <ref type="bibr">(21-23)</ref>. Furthermore, with changes in gene models, RNAi phenotypes attributed to a specific gene may be linked to a different gene in the future. Similar limitations apply to RNAi reagents targeting specific splice variants of genes. RNAi libraries evolve, as we learn more about the RNAi mechanism and potential pitfalls such as off-target effects second generation libraries will incorporate these findings into design rules and attempt to generate more specific. The GenomeRNAi database is linked to other databases, such as FLIGHT and FlyRNAi <ref type="bibr">(24,25)</ref>. While all these databases contain RNAi phenotype information, the focus of GenomeRNAi is to present phenotypes in the context of genomic information, which should facilitate the analysis of RNAi phenotypes with respect to gene models and specificity information. GenomeRNAi has an integrated pipeline for mapping of RNAi probes and phenotypes and integrating the information of different RNAi libraries, but the focus is less on the integration of different genomic datasets as provided by FLIGHT.</p>

>             <p>This is the first randomized controlled trial report to date of using NIV ventilator equipped with built-in software to monitor the ventilator parameters in home setting in stable hypercapnic COPD patients. In order to estimate the accuracy of built-in software in ventilators, data downloaded from software were compared using the PowerLab system. The finding showed that the estimation of leak and pressure was a low mean bias value between built-in software and PowerLab system. Previous study showed that the rate of abnormalities was 66% and leak was the most common abnormality (34.2%) followed by desaturation dips (23.8%) in home NPPV. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> In addition, studies have further reported that leak increases ineffective trigger, patient-ventilator asynchrony, and hypoventilation in patients. <ref type="bibr">20-22</ref> In our study, the mean estimation of leak was 37.99 L/min and 87% of the leaks were ,40 L/min, which was greatly lower than the threshold leak influencing the effects of NPPV as reported by previous study, <ref type="bibr">23</ref> which could ensure the appropriateness of NIV use and reliability of the results.</p>

In addition, the relative phosphorylation state of the protein was analysed and quantified by comparing peak areas of the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated tryptic peptides derived from the same analysis (see also 'Determination of phosphorylation stoichiometry', and the workflow diagram in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1)</ref>.</p>
>             <p>This study has demonstrated for the first time the absolute quantification of three distinct M. truncatula SuSy isoforms in an independent tissue-specific manner. It is shown that, besides the nodule-enhanced SuSy1, two other protein isoforms are present in root nodules at quantifiable amounts. De novo sequencing allowed for the identification of a new peptide sequence, most probably driven from the second most abundant isoform SuSy2, which complements the existing sequence information based on transcript data. Absolute quantification of N metabolism enzymes was carried out, enabling the discrimination of different protein isoforms from a single analysis, even when those isoforms were present at very low amounts. Nodule SuSy1 was shown to be hyperphosphorylated at Ser11 in M. truncatula and novel phosphoproteins present in nodules were identified.

Gene expression was analysed in leaves, stems, floral buds, and flowers of three different B. napus accessions, the winter type Express, the semi-winter type Ningyou7 (with or without prior vernalization), and the spring type Haydn (with or without prior vernalization), using primer combinations specific for either the gene pair BnaA.FRI.a/BnaX.FRI.d or BnaX.FRI.b/BnaX.FRI.c. Individual genes of a gene pair were distinguished by gel electrophoresis on the basis of size differences (BnaA.FRI.a/ BnaX.FRI.d), or by gel electrophoresis following XhoI restriction (BnaX.FRI.b and BnaX.FRI.c). RT-PCR fragments of the expected sizes were obtained in most samples from all three accessions, demonstrating that all four B. napus FRI genes are expressed in accessions of different growth types <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2B)</ref>. Expression levels were similar between the different ecotypes and between vernalized and non-vernalized plants. However, while BnaX.FRI.b and BnaX.FRI.c transcripts were ubiquitously and relatively evenly expressed across all tissues analysed, BnaA.FRI.a and BnaA.FRI.d exhibited marked differences in expression, which ranged from barely detectable in leaves and stems to very high in flowers <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2B)</ref>.

>             <p>Table 2 provides a comparative summary of regional economic effects of the proposed East Asian RTAs by type of RTA. The aggregate effect of the currently effective AFTA had no significant negative effects on the discriminatory liberalization of the Northeast Asian neighbors, but produced significant enough positive gains to ASEAN members. However, if ASEAN members decide to pursue the ASEAN Hub scenario, which includes three sets of ASEAN+1 FTA, it could raise ASEAN's gains from free trade. ASEAN's welfare and GDP gains could be raised to more than three times that of the AFTA. The negative effects on excluded neighbors could be problematic, although the neighboring countries 18. The trade barriers include both tariff and non-tariff barriers. For import tariffs, trade-weighted ad valorem tariffs include tariff rate quotas and the ad valorem equivalents of specific tariffs. The export taxes cover ordinary export subsidies, export tax equivalents of Agreement on Textiles and Clothing quotas, price undertakings and voluntary export restraints. The protection rates in service sectors are assumed to be zero in the GTAP Database. For more detailed information, visit https:// www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/v6/v6_doco.asp. 19. As the referee indicated, the base year for existing RTA, such as the ASEAN-China FTA, should be 2004 or 2005 (right before the year into force in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). However, similar to other hypothetical scenarios in the present paper, the complete elimination of trade barriers between ASEAN and China are assumed and simulated. Of course, we acknowledge this data problem as a limitation.could increase their exports because of the income effect from the additional GDP gains of ASEAN, with the increase in bilateral trade volume between ASEAN and each of the three Northeast Asian countries. In terms of the negative effects that could be expected from AFTA or the ASEAN Hub scenario, the Northeast Asian neighbors might decide to form their own regional protection strategy against ASEAN by developing a ChinaJapan-Korea FTA. The trade warfare between the two regions could be harmful to the less-developed ASEAN economy and would enormously benefit the Northeast Asian countries, especially the smallest country, like Korea. However, this duplicating RTA competition might not be beneficial to the world economy. It will cause much lower welfare gains to the world economy than those with the existing AFTA and ASEAN Hub scenario.</p>

>             <p>Medical records and multimodal imaging, including color fundus photography (CFP), red-free photography (RF), fundus autofluorescence (FAF), near-infrared reflectance scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (NIR), and SD-OCT was performed on all the patients. CFP and RF were performed with a TRC-50IX flood-illuminated fundus camera (Topcon Medical Systems, Oakland, NJ, USA). FAF was performed with either the Spectralis HRA þ OCT (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) or the Topcon TRC-50IX fundus camera. SD-OCT imaging with corresponding NIR images was performed on the Spectralis. OCT scans taken before the acquisition of eyetracked Spectralis scans were assessed qualitatively but not included in the quantitative analysis. The SD-OCT protocol used in all eyes comprised 208 horizontal raster line scans over the area of interest, ranging from 19 to 49 B-scans per eye, with each scan spaced 115 to 250 lm apart, and automatic real-time averaging set between 4 and 23.</p>

>             <p>After the intervention, balance measuring equipment (Good Balance, Metitur, Finland) was used to quantitatively measure each subject's balance ability <ref type="bibr">5)</ref>. The balance test was performed by a physical therapist who had completed the course for the balance test method and was experienced in clinical practice for over three years. To measure balance function, the subject was instructed to stand on a triangle platform and maintain a symmetrical posture with the feet shoulder width apart. A visual fixed point was located in front of the subject to minimize head movements. The subject's arms were placed comfortably at the hip joints and the center of pressure (COP) was measured for 30 seconds in the standing posture with the eyes open. COP was measured three times and average values were calculated. The software also calculates several variables describing the quantitative aspects of individual's test behaviour, e.g. amount and speed of anterior-posterior and medial-lateral sway, amplitude of sway, the first moment of sway velocity (combined amplitude and velocity of the movement of the center of pressure), power spectrum analysis (FFT analysis) etc. Low score of anterior-posterior and medial-lateral sway implies excellent balance ability. The index of balance function score ranges between 0 and 100, and a higher score implies greater balance ability to perform the task. A reliable and valid measurement of the functioning of posture control mechanisms is a prerequisite for discovering the reasons for balance problems or evaluating the effects of treatment and rehabilitation.</p>

>             <p>Our interest in this issue comes from the emergence of a hybrid form of governance between intermediation and community building. On the one hand, these platforms define themselves as 'intermediaries', creating an apparent proximity with other online intermediaries such as eBay.com, Craigslist or Facebook, because of a strong technological integration with the Web 2.0 (including social networks and user reviews) <ref type="bibr">(Belk 2014)</ref>. The main difference between intermediaries and merchants is the distribution of control between the platform and the participants <ref type="bibr">(Hagiu 2007)</ref>. While the merchants keep full control over the sale (e.g. pricing, quantities), intermediaries only control the affiliation to their platform, taking the form of a two-sided platform connecting independent sellers and buyers. On the other hand, by putting forward the idea of sharing, these platforms position themselves in a moral system interested in social welfare <ref type="bibr">(Botsman and Rogers 2011)</ref>. Assuming that learning and enforcing morality is the result of both individual attributes and social relations <ref type="bibr">(Hodgson 2014)</ref>, decentralized platforms do not provide the structure for this kind of social enterprise. For instance, we can observe this ambiguity in the governance of Airbnb, in which the platform emphasizes its role of intermediary by describing itself as "a trusted community marketplace" 1 rather than a company or a merchant. Yet, on September 8th 2016, Brian Chesky, CEO and co-founder of Airbnb addressed an email to the entire community of users entitled "Discrimination and Belonging". <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The core of the email consists in the acknowledgment of discrimination on the platform, and the description of new platform policies implementing stronger control over the users' behaviors.</p>
>             <p>By focusing on the individual participants rather than the platform, we need to adopt a performance measure that will reflect this perspective (instead of plaform market shares or winner-take-all competition). We do so by adopting the concept of "allocative efficiency" <ref type="bibr">(Gode and Sunder 1993, 1997)</ref>. In its most generic form, "allocative efficiency is the ratio of the actual to the potential gains from trade" <ref type="bibr">(Gode and Sunder 1997: 603)</ref>. The upper bound of the "potential gains" is reached when the participants can make all the transactions they desire, either as suppliers when they share their possessions, or as customers by accessing the shared goods. Concretely, on the demand side, Airbnb is functioning efficiently if the guests find a room when they desire to travel or BlaBlacar is efficient when there is a seat available for one's desired journey. On the supply side, both the revenue and the efficient utilization of our shareable possessions are impacted if an Airbnb host or a BlaBlaCar traveler cannot find a buyer. From the public good perspective, such a failure can be seen as proof that profit-based platforms cannot provide the basic level of service required by Universal Service obligations <ref type="bibr">(Slee 2016)</ref> or provided by incumbent firms <ref type="bibr">(Cusumano 2015)</ref>.</p>
>             <p>Our model captures the operation of a peer-to-peer marketplace guided by decentralized decision-making and user reviews. Our objective is to compare the performance of different motivations when the peers try to complete transactions. We present our model as an online platform for accommodations (such as Airbnb): the customers are 'guests' who want to find a 'host' for a night at a given location. Below, we describe the model in three blocks / sub-sections:</p>
>             <p>In more detail, we learned from the literature on user reviews that reviews contribute to reputation building and are being used as a proxy rather than a fair source of information. For instance, Fradkin (2014) analyzed search data from Airbnb and shows that potential customers filter the listings based on objective variables (mostly the location and maximum price) before browsing the remaining listings and evaluating more subjective characteristics (including the number and text of reviews). Such a distinction can be found in the model of an online market with a self-selection bias of user reviews built by <ref type="bibr">Li and Hitt (2008)</ref>. In their model, they distinguish two classes of attributes: the 'search attributes', which can be inspected before the transaction, and the 'experience attributes', which are specific to each customer based on its experience of the product.</p>
>             <p>&amp; Price Strategy: <ref type="bibr">Zervas et al. (2017)</ref> point up how Airbnb has affected a specific segment of the hospitality industry, the lower-end hotels. Hotels offering business services do not suffer from the emergence of this platform. <ref type="bibr">Guttentag (2015)</ref> observes that Airbnb is attractive to the low end of the market and covers a demand that is unattractive for the incumbents of the hospitality industry. Airbnb provides accommodations cheaper than hotels. Our understanding is that saving money is a strong motivation on these platforms:</p>
>             <p>From the participant perspective, our results echo the work of <ref type="bibr">Lauermann et al. (2017)</ref> showing that decentralized mechanisms can achieve allocation efficiency even when the participants ignore the exact market condition (including their own characteristics), provided that the search frictions are small. To diminish the search friction, the platform should use all the governance mechanisms (monetary, nonmonetary and informational) at its disposal <ref type="bibr">(Boudreau and Hagiu 2009; Phelps et al. 2008)</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr">Gode and Sunder (1997)</ref> face a similar problem when their double auction system cannot prevent the allocative inefficiency resulting from the displacement of intramarginal traders by extramarginal traders (who do not value the goods as much as the intramarginal traders). As a solution, they sketch an alternative market governance that almost mimics the mechanism of centralized assortative matching (e.g., bids and asks closer to actual constraints, delayed decisions queuing in a clearing house). In the same line, <ref type="bibr">Anderson and Renault (1999)</ref> use search costs to explain the emergence of "tourist traps", i.e., options with similar characteristics and largely overpriced, because "buyers do not shop around". Different mechanisms can be tested to achieve such results. In addition to the non-monetary instruments proposed above and following the lessons from the two-sided market literature, the platform can regulate the behaviors monetarily by subsidizing the underactive participants using fees collected from their overpriced counterpart. The platform can also modify how the information is displayed, for instance, to alter the tolerance and the price range of the participants. In fact, Airbnb uses such a mechanism in the search ranking of accommodations. 6</p>

Serum concentrations of lutein, zeaxanthin, b-cryptoxanthin, a-carotene, b-carotene, and lycopene were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection, as described by Craft et al. <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref>. Assays were standardized against appropriate National Institute of Standards and Technology control materials. The fasting serum lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides) was assessed using enzymatic colorimetric assays (Roche Diagnostics Limited, West Sussex, U.K.) on the ILab-600 biochemical analyzer (Instrumentation Laboratory, Warrington, U.K.). LDL cholesterol was calculated using a standard Friedewald equation <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>. Plasma adiponectin (total, high-molecular weight, medium-molecular weight, and lowmolecular weight) were measured by ELISA (ALPCO diagnostics); low-molecular weight adiponectin was obtained by subtracting the combined concentration of medium-molecular weight and highmolecular weight adiponectin (measured directly) from the total adiponectin concentration. Serum insulin levels were measured by ELISA (Abbot IMx; Abbott Laboratories, Berkshire, U.K.). Plasma glucose levels were measured using an automated glucose oxidase method using a Beckman Glucose Analyzer 2. Fasting glucose and insulin levels were used to calculate the HOMA score <ref type="bibr">(23)</ref>. Commercial kits were used to measure C-peptide (Dako UK Ltd, Ely, U.K.) and nonesterified fatty acids (Wako Chemicals GmbH, Neuss, Germany) on the ILab-600 biochemical analyzer (Instrumentation Laboratory).</p>

>             <p>All participants were instructed not to exercise excessively and to refrain from caffeinated beverages, alcoholic beverages, and smoking for 3 hours before the psychophysiological measurements were collected. A lead II electrocardiogram (ECG) was collected for 5 minutes at baseline using the ProComp Infiniti TM system (Thought Technology Ltd., Montreal, Canada), which was installed on a laptop. A sampling rate of 2,048/second was set in order to acquire real-time interbeat intervals. The physiological signals were collected between 9:00 to 12:00 a.m. and 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. to minimize any effects of biological circadian variations. The CardiacPro Infiniti HRV analysis module (Thought Technology Ltd.) with fast Fourier transformation was used to transform the interbeat intervals into the various frequency domains of the HRV indices, namely LF power (0.04-0.15 Hz), HF power (0.15-0.4 Hz), and the LF/HF ratio. The time domain of the HRV index of the SDNN was also obtained.</p>

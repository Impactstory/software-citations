            <p>For each participant, a generalized linear model (GLM) was created using time-series predictors for each of the 3 amygdala subregions and 9 nuisance covariates (timeseries predictors for global signal, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and 6 motion parameters). The global signal is thought to reflect a combination of physiological processes (ie cardiac and respiratory fluctuations), and therefore, it was included in the GLM to control for such factors. Correlation analysis was carried out between the seed ROIs and PFC in a voxel-wise manner using REST. The correlation coefficients were then transformed to Z-values using the Fisher r-to-z transformation. In the first-level analysis, a 1-sample t test model was used to delineate the functional connectivity of each amygdala ROI. In the second-level random effects analysis, direct comparisons were conducted to identify differences in functional connectivity between SZ vs HC, BD vs HC, and SZ vs BD. Statistical significance was determined by a corrected P &lt; .05. Correction for multiple comparisons was made by combining individual voxel P &lt; .005 with cluster size &gt; 432mm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> , determined by the Monte Carlo simulation (AlphaSim command line in AFNI [analysis of functional neuroimaging; Cox, 1996] <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">53</ref> ). An additional Bonferroni correction (P = .005/P = .00056) was used as well, because a total of 9 two-sample t tests (SZ vs HC, BD vs HC, and SZ vs BD, multiplied by 3 ROIs) were performed. Exploratory analyses were performed to examine the correlation between the Z-values of regions showing significant group differences and symptom rating scores (the BPRS in the SZ group, and the HDRS and YMRS in the BD group). A 2-tailed P level of .05 was considered significant.</p>
            <p>Data were acquired on a GE Signa HDX 3.0T MRI scanner. A standard head coil was used with foam padding to reduce head motion. Participants were instructed to rest with their eyes closed during scanning. No participant reported falling asleep during the scan when routinely asked immediately after scanning. FMRI data were collected using a gradient-echo planar imaging sequence sensitive to BOLD contrast (TR = 2000ms, TE = 30ms, Diverse Amygdala-Frontal Connectivity in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder flip angle = 90&#176;, FOV = 24 &#215; 24cm, matrix = 64 &#215; 64). Thirty-five axial slices were collected with 3-mm thickness without gap. For spatial normalization and localization, a 3-dimensional fast spoiled gradient-echo T1-weighted sequence was used to acquire high-resolution structural images (TR = 7.1ms, TE = 3.2ms, FOV = 24 &#215; 24cm, matrix = 240 &#215; 240, slice thickness = 1.0mm without gap, 176 slices, 1 averages). Image preprocessing was carried out using SPM5 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) and Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST) (http:// www.restfmri.net). Preprocessing using SPM5 consisted of slice-time correction, motion correction, spatial normalization, and spatial smoothing full width at half maximum (FWHM = 6mm). Movement parameters were examined for each participant. Data sets with more than 2mm maximum translation in x, y or z, or 2&#176; of maximum rotation about 3 axes between each image were excluded. Preprocessing using REST consisted of removing linear drift through linear regression and temporal band-pass filtering (0.01-0.08 Hz) to reduce the effects of lowfrequency drifts and physiological high-frequency noise.</p>
            <p>In direct comparison between the SZ and BD groups, the SZ group showed significantly decreased rsFC between the LB amygdala and right DLPFC (BA 46/9) compared with the BD group (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>). In contrast, the BD group showed significantly decreased rsFC between the LB amygdala and pregenual ACC (BA 24) and rostral PFC (BA 10) compared with the SZ group (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>; figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>). These findings correspond to a corrected P &lt; .05 by AlphaSim correction.</p>
            <p>In direct comparison between the SZ and BD groups, the SZ group showed significantly decreased rsFC between the CM amygdala and right DLPFC (BA 46/9) compared with the BD group (table 2; figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>). These findings correspond to a corrected P &lt; .05 by AlphaSim correction.</p>
            <p>In direct comparison between the SZ and BD groups, the SZ group showed significantly decreased FC between the SF amygdala and right DLPFC (BA 46/9) and left DLPFC (BA 46/9) compared with the BD group (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). In contrast, the BD group showed significantly decreased rsFC between the SF amygdala and pregenual/ ventral ACC, rostral PFC (BA 24/25/32/10), and right OFC (BA 47), and left OFC (BA 47) with extension into the temporopolar area (BA 38) compared with the SZ group (table 2; figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). These findings correspond to a corrected P &lt; .05 by AlphaSim correction. Findings also survived Bonferroni correction for multiple t tests (P = .00056) except for those in the right ventral ACC-CM amygdala rsFC and left ventral ACC-SF amygdala rsFC in HC vs BD, right DLPFC-SF amygdala rsFC in HC vs SZ, and left pregenual ACC and rostral PFC-LB amygdala rsFC in SZ vs BD (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p>

            <p>We focused on the differential expression of genes involved in cellular biofunctions with a criterion of FC &gt;1.2 using the IPA software. While several genes overlapped based on cellular functions, we were able to cluster them according to their GO annotations as: cell cycle, cell death, cell morphology, growth and proliferation, development, and movement (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). The individual heatmaps were generated according to hierarchal clustering of genes which are involved in the cellular processes (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). According to IPA analysis, there were 66 differentially expressed genes detected to have a role in cellular movement ; 48 were upregulated, and 18 were FIGURE 1 | Venn diagrams. Multiple microarray experiments were designed to detect differential expression of transcripts with TGF&#946; treatment and were compared using Venn diagrams. List of differentially expressed genes with their accession IDs were uploaded to GeneVenn, query was run, and the detected numbers and gene lists were exported to MS Excel. Graphical figure is illustrated using the Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Inc, CA, USA). Relations among the list of altered genes within TGF&#946; treatment groups are depicted as intersections or uniqueness. A significant overlap of differentially expressed genes was observed between the TGF&#946;1 and TGF&#946;2 treatment groups both in the upregulated (A) or downregulated (B) gene lists.</p>
            <p>A table of genes vital to the morphogenesis of orofacial development was constructed based on the most recent literature review (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">A2</ref> in Appendix; <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Wilkie and Morriss-Kay, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Lidral and Moreno, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gritli-Linde, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dixon et al., 2011)</ref>. Genes from the table of cellular biofunctions (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) were merged with the Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">A2</ref> in Appendix to filter the differentially expressed genes according to putative candidates for palatal deformities. Some of the genes listed were identified as being important for palatogenesis in mouse, but not directly associated with human cases of cleft palate and thus remain "putative" cleft palate genes in the latter, as labeled with asterisk ( * ) in the Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">A2</ref> in Appendix. Overlapping genes (n = 11) were presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> with their FC and p-values. Among these genes, EDN1, INHBA, TGF&#946;1, TGF&#946;2, RUNX1, LHX8, SNAI1, PDGFC, and PIGA were upregulated; while only SMAD3 was downregulated in response to TGF&#946;treatment. Intriguingly, TGF&#946;R1 was upregulated with TGF&#946;1 treatment and downregulated with TGF&#946;2 treatment; which correlates with FIGURE 3 | Direct and indirect relations of most differentially expressed genes with TGF&#946;. Affymetrix probe identifiers and FC values of significantly altered transcripts (n = 27) were uploaded to IPA and each identifier was mapped to its corresponding gene object in the IKB. Interactions were then queried between these gene objects and all other gene objects stored within IPA to generate a set of direct interaction networks that were merged. Networks with the highest number of molecules were selected, overlaid with TGF&#946; molecules, and organized using Path Designer of IPA. Upregulated transcripts were highlighted with orange (A); and downregulated transcripts were highlighted with green (B). Types of molecules were annotated in the legend in the box. isoform-specific receptor requirement in TGF&#946; signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Rojas et al., 2009)</ref>. Ingenuity pathway analysis, a knowledge based program to generate relevant and interacting biological networks, was used to determine how the differentially expressed overlapping genes might interact to facilitate cellular biofunctions. A direct interaction network of the orofacial deformity susceptibility genes, overlaid with clustered cellular biofunctions crucial for development and maturation of the palatal mesenchyme was generated and is presented in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>. Finally, the localization of differentially expressed genes within the canonical TGF&#946; pathway was illustrated by using the IPA Path Designer in FIGURE 4 | Hierarchical clustering (heatmap) analysis of differentially expressed transcripts. Altered genes were clustered based on cellular biofunctions and heatmaps were constructed using Bioconductor. Coexpressed groups of genes were illustrated with dendrograms and progressively and distinctly up-or downregulated genes were ranked accordingly. Each column corresponds to the expression profile of a treatment (either TGF&#946; or Control) in triplicate, and each row corresponds to a transcript. The increasing intensities of red signify a higher expression in the given sample of a specific mRNA, whereas the increasing intensities of green indicate a lower expression of mRNA and black indicates mean level expression. The list of genes for each particular function (A-F) was shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.  </p>

            <p>COS-1 cells were grown on glass cover-slips and transfected as indicated earlier. At 48 hours after transfection, cells were fixed with ice-cold 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated with the primary antibody anti-Flag M2 (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 488 Donkey Anti-Goat IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC; Invitrogen). Finally, cells were stained with 4&#8242;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich Co.), and cover-slips were mounted onto microscope slides in the presence of Mowiol mounting medium. Fluorescence images were captured with a LEICA TCS SP5 DMI-6000B confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems Inc., Wetzlar, Germany) using excitation wavelength of 488 nm (for FITC) and were analyzed with LEICA LAS AF (Leica Microsystems Inc.).

            <p>The aforementioned samples were used for the IHC study. The 3 &#956;m sections were mounted on FLEX IHC Microscope slides (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and subjected to deparaffinization and hydration followed by heat-induced epitope retrieval in citrate buffer (pH 6.0). IHC staining was performed on these sections using a specific antibody against LTA (dilution 1:10; following manufacturer's instructions; reference HPA007729; Sigma-Aldrich Co.), and the reaction was visualized by the EnVision (TM FLEX detection system kit (Dako). Normal adult human brain sections from the hippocampal area were used as a positive control. Images were taken using a Leica DM4000 B light microscope equipped with a Leica DFC490 digital camera (Leica Microsystems Inc.), and final processing of images was done with the Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems) program.

            <p>The platform literature captures the strategies of all of the rivals except Google and, too some degree, Apple. Apple, by not allowing complementors in manufacturing (it controls all manufacturing through outsourcing), strictly controlling application developers, and exclusively licensing operators, differs from the more open platform strategies discussed in most of the literature. Google has introduced a platform, but, at the moment, has undertaken none of the strategic initiatives one would expect if it was intending to monetize the platform. As mentioned earlier, for example, it has allowed operators to fork Android. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> It gives little support to and exerts little control over the applications community, allowing malware applications to emerge. While this strategy might change in the future if Android becomes dominant, this suggests that it is not pursuing a textbook platform strategy. It is impossible to generalize from a single case that is still evolving, but it indicates the possibility of using platforms, as auxiliaries to different value-capture strategies than has been understood in the platform literature.</p>
            <p>Apple has enormous advantages in the sense that it was the first mover and has continually been the aggressor moving from the iPod to the iPhone and now the iPad using an almost seamless user experience. These strengths and the momentum are powerful. Though the iOS devices allow users to access the entire Internet, the hardware exists in a closed platform of iTunes and the App Store. The popularity and elegance of Apple's product offer ample opportunity to application providers, but Apple's supreme power in the ecosystem places them in a vulnerable position. Unfortunately, this closed platform strategy is assailable and is now threatened by Google. Banishing Adobe, a very important complementor, from the iPhone world drove a neutral party with enormous software capabilities toward the Android world. Whether or not it is true that Flash would have allowed software vendors to sell directly to iPhone users and not be forced to go through the Apple App's store <ref type="bibr">(Copeland 2010)</ref>, it created an instant and unforeseen ally for Android.</p>
            <p>In the U.S., Nokia had little market share, so when Google offered Android, the carriers and the phone makers felt a strong economic pressure to adopt as they needed a response to the iPhone. Windows Mobile was inferior to Android and appeared more costly. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> In many respects, for other members of the mobile telephony ecosystem, Android was the only viable choice-despite the fact that they feared it would commoditize their network. The alternative was to lose market share and lucrative data download revenues. Moreover, since Google generates revenues through advertisements, it can share these ad revenues with carriers, thereby giving them a stake in encouraging more Android phones to use their network. Google's acquisition of AdMob helped make this possible (Frommer 2010). Recently, Apple has offered other carriers their own iPhones, a necessary response, as the other carriers were becoming all Android operations.</p>
            <p>Android provides an increasingly attractive platform upon which applications can be built, thereby competing for developer attention with Apple. As is true on the Internet, Google's main revenue source on the mobile Internet will be advertising revenue. Depending upon how it handles access to the Android platform, it can afford not to extract rents from the application developers-a model that contrasts with Apple's onerous terms <ref type="bibr">(Apple 2010)</ref>. The Android business model also provides a platform that is not directly controlled by Google, thereby separating it from direct responsibility for the types of applications developed, but also suggesting that Google is unlikely to directly compete with third-party applications.</p>
            <p>The Android challenge is asymmetric because Google is agnostic in almost all directions. In the first instance, it is purely interested in growth of traffic that it can monetize through advertising. The free operating system unfetters pure-play manufacturers from worrying about either building their own OS or licensing the OS from a direct competitor. Google can provide an elegant low-cost OS because Google's monetization strategy relocates value capture. The Android platform encourages new entrants of all sorts, and the seriousness of the challenge to both Nokia and Apple is clear. At an employee event, Apple CEO Steve Jobs is reported to have exclaimed, "We did not enter the search business. They entered the phone business. Make no mistake-they want to kill the iPhone" <ref type="bibr">(Abell 2010)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Nokia's strength as the dominant cell phone incumbent should not be underestimated. Only 2 years ago, the Nokia/Symbian global smartphone market share was enormous, but as Table <ref type="table">3</ref> indicates it is rapidly losing market share. While it has critical complementary assets, including close relationships with many of the world's largest carriers, first-class manufacturing, deep technological capabilities, and rapidly increasing cell phone market share in the world's developing country markets, the threat to its domination are clear.</p>

            <p>The mitochondrial assembly method was largely similar to that of the chloroplast; however, a reasonably close reference mitochondrial genome was not available for the initial read-mapping. Geneious de novo assembly was performed with default settings on the entire data set, divided into three approximately equal parts to reduce RAM requirements to feasible levels. Mitochondrial contigs were distinguished by BLAST searches against the Vitis vinifera L. mitochondrial genome <ref type="bibr">( Goremykin et al., 2008 )</ref>. This procedure was found to produce very long mitochondrial contigs compared to preliminary Velvet and SOAP <ref type="bibr">( Luo et al., 2012 )</ref> assemblies, as long as 122,611 bp. Comparing the assemblies revealed that the Geneious contigs contained all of the mitochondrial sequence assembled by the other programs, but in fewer pieces. Consensus sequences of these contigs ( n = 39) were used in iterative assembly, circular reference construction, and assembly validation as above.</p>
            <p>Enrichment statistics -Percent on-target statistics ( Table <ref type="table">1</ref> ) were calculated by mapping reads to the reference loci using the Geneious native assembler (low sensitivity settings) and dividing the number of mapped reads by the total number of reads per each accession; the same method was used to determine read percentages for the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes using the mitochondrial and chloroplast references. Other assembly statistics ( Table <ref type="table">1</ref> ) were derived from the BWA assemblies used in downstream analyses, but also calculated in Geneious. Missing data, pairwise identity, and other alignment statistics ( Table <ref type="table">2</ref> ) were derived in Geneious from the MAFFT alignments.</p>

            <p>Following the initial TE detection phase we examined each position where a TE was identified, including TEs identified in the appropriate reference, in each other line in that species. At this stage, we were able to both identify TEs which had previously been missed by our pipeline as well as to make absence calls by reconstructing a contig that spans the TE insertion location. Repetitive content independent of TEs was defined using an all-by-all BLASTn comparison <ref type="bibr">(Altschul et al. 1990</ref>) of sequence 500-bp upstream and downstream of duplication coordinates in the D. yakuba and D. simulans references at an E value 10 &#192;5 with no filter for low complexity or repetitive sequences. We used a resampling approach to identify overrepresentation of duplications associated with direct repeats. We performed 10,000,000 replicates choosing the same number of tandem duplications at random and determining whether an equal or greater number was identified on the X chromosome.</p>

We retained only those tandem duplicates which are not present in outgroup reference genomes of D. melanogaster, D. erecta, and D. yakuba or D. simulans as defined in a BLAST search (see Materials and Methods) suggesting recent origins.</p>

The typical structure of short hairpin RNA has been previously described <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref>. The two complementary oligonucleotides of this short hairpin structure were annealed and inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the RNAi-Ready pSIREN-RetroQZsGreen Vector (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). These plasmids were named pshRNA-B1, pshRNA-B2 and pshRNA-B3, respectively (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). On the other hand, a plasmid with a non-specific sequence was used as a negative control (pshRNA-negative) and was described elsewhere <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref>. These recombinant plasmids vectors independently express a Zoanthus sp. green fluorescent protein, engineered for brighter fluorescence (excitation maximum = 496 nm; emission maximum = 506 nm), and as result, transfected cells emit green fluorescent protein (GFP).</p>

            <p>In addition to greater coverage, modules identified using function-based alignment displayed higher biological coherence than sequence-based alignment using any of the other methods (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>). Almost 50% of the modules identified by our technique scored 0.5 or more compared to only 30% when using sequencebased MAS; MaWISH and NetworkBLAST both performed far worse. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>b, function-based alignment also identifies modules that correlate better with experimentally verified complexes. Around one-third of the modules correspond well(overlap &gt;50%) with a MIPS complex as opposed to only one-tenth of the modules from MaWISH and NetworkBlast.</p>
            <p>We compared the performance of function and sequence-based network alignment by aligning the human network with yeast and fly networks.Function-based alignment was carried out using MAS only, while sequencebased alignment was done using MAS, MaWISH and NetworkBlast. For sequence-based alignment, the orthology file was generated by selecting pairs of proteins with BLAST E-values &#8804;1e&#8722;7 the cut-off used by <ref type="bibr">Sharan et al. (2005)</ref>. The combined method was tested by using alignment results from MAS (both sequence and function based) as input. To observe the effect of multiple networks combined method was executed using sets of two (human-yeast, human-fly, fly-yeast and human-worm) as well as three (human-yeast-fly) networks.</p>
            <p>We tested our new similarity measure using the MAS network alignment algorithm. Instead of creating an alignment graph, MAS uses a recursive process that alternately identifies locally matching nodes across two networks and then splits the matching sub-graphs into connected components. Nodes are deemed locally matching if they share sequence similarity as well as network neighborhood. In the case of multiple orthologs for a node, the orthologs are aligned independently of each other. They can therefore be part of different sub-graphs in the alignment. MAS is relatively fast and uses a flexible node similarity component that uses BLAST <ref type="bibr">(Altschul et al., 1990)</ref> E-values in the original implementation. We modified it to use our functional similarity scores. A cutoff score of 0.9 was used to select highly similar proteins. We found that this particular choice of cutoff identifies functional matches for a significant proportion of proteins across two species whilst keeping multiple hits within reasonable limits.</p>
            <p>The human DAB <ref type="bibr">(Moldanodo et al., 1990</ref>) is a multi-protein complex involved in transcription initiation and consists of the TFIID complex, TFIIA complex and TFIIB. It is present in the MIPS database as complex ID 493 which lists 16 proteins as its subunits, 15 of which are transcription initiation factors and 1 is a TATA-box binding protein. It is a typical target of module detection methods both in terms of the number of proteins involved as well as the tight functional relationships between them. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the performance of our combined approach along with NetworkBlast and MaWish in terms of their ability to correctly identify this complex in the human network.</p>
            <p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> also shows the execution time for each of the methods on a machine with a 1.66 GHz processor with 1 GB RAM. Further analysis of other species (Supplementary Material) indicates that the run times of the alignment algorithms are extremely sensitive to the number of orthologs between two species. The simultaneous clustering approach is an exception to this, as it does not experience an explosion in the number of possible alignments due to multiple possible orthologs, experienced by MAS, NetworkBlast and MaWISH.</p>

            <p>To check that CRISPRFinder was efficient in recovering all the CRISPRs from a genome, we compared the results to other available studies on CRISPRs <ref type="bibr">(15,20)</ref>. The data were generally in good agreement, the differences being always in the DR boundaries' identification (more accurate with CRISPRFinder) or in the number of motifs found, as the truncated DR is sometimes neglected or short clusters are not detected with other programs. Interestingly, some strains were claimed to be devoid of CRISPRs by Godde and colleagues but proved to have short CRISPRs with CRISPRFinder, such as in different Shigella sp. (S. sonnei Ss046, S. flexneri 2a str. 301, S. flexneri 2a str), or even long CRISPRs such as in Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14. The latter example is shown on the CRISPRfinder website (sample2), and as can be seen by using the BLAST spacer function, six spacers out of thirty six at two different CRISPR loci, correspond to a bacteriophage sequence (bacteriophages F116, B3, D3112, DMS3 and phi CTX).</p>
            <p>CRISPRFinder core routines were developed in Perl under Debian Linux. The input of the web tool is a genomic query sequence of length up to 67 Mb in 'FASTA' format. Possible locations of CRISPRs (consisting of at least one motif) are detected by finding maximal repeats. A maximal repeat <ref type="formula">26</ref>) is a repeat that cannot be extended in either direction without incurring a mismatch. The total number of maximal repeats in a sequence of size n is linear (less than n) which is interesting since the computation may be done in linear time using a suffix-tree-based algorithm. A CRISPR pattern of two DRs and a spacer may be considered as a maximal repeat where the repeated sequences are separated by a sequence of approximately the same length.</p>

            <p>We have performed a simple experiment to explore: (1) our current knowledge of the universe of sequences, and how this knowledge has evolved in the past years, and (2) the possible extent of failures when taxonomically assigning ORFs to their closest relatives. Using the Blast in Grids (BiG) service <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aparicio et al., 2007)</ref>, we have run BLASTX searches for several metagenomes against the realease 159 (April 2007) of GenBank non-redundant protein database, extracted the homologues found for each putative ORF [following the procedure described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Tamames and Moya (2008)</ref>] and assigned the ORF to the taxon of its best hit (where different threshold of minimum identity have been used). Next, we have collected the dates of creation of the GenBank entries of these hits. In this way, we can simulate the results that we would have obtained in the past, by restricting the list of homologues to those already present in the database in a particular date, which allowed us to explore how the results change as the database grows. The experiment was repeated for different metagenomes and different taxonomic depths. One of the results is shown in the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>, for a farm soil metagenome <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Tringe et al., 2005)</ref>. Each row corresponds to a single ORF, displaying the colour of the class to which it would have been assigned in different dates. The plot shows clearly that many of the assignments have changed, even in recent times (between 10% and 20% of the assignments at class level have varied in the last 2 years). This can be easily seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>, which shows the accumulated number of changes with respect to previous dates. Several trends are noticeable: (1) The rate of change does not decrease in recent times, instead it clearly increases for most cases. This trend of change can be noticed even for broad taxonomic ranks such as phylum: for instance, Acidobacteria phylum is now recognized as one of the most abundant taxa in many soils <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Barns et al., 1999)</ref>, but until recently no sequences were assigned to it. This indicates that the full diversity of these communities is still not well described in the current databases, and that best hit approach for taxonomic classification is at least risky. (2) Although most changes consist in the assignment of previously unclassified ORFs, the classification for many ORFs has also changed. (3) Abrupt changes occur in response to the availability of complete genomes, especially from close species to those represented in the metagenomes. Again for Acidobacteria, We analyzed 60 000 randomly selected sequences from the full metagenome, using blastx searches and a threshold of 60% minimum identity between query and hit proteins. Each row in the plot corresponds to a single ORF, showing with colours how the assignment has varied in time (colours indicate different taxonomic classes). (B) This plot shows the accumulated number of ORFs that changed their assignment between consecutive months (expressed as the ratio of number of changes/total number of ORFs), for different metagenomes (Blue, whale fall; Red, human gut; Green, farm soil; Black, Sargasso sea). The changes are divided between new assignments (the ORF was previously unassigned, dashed lines) and assignment changes (assignment to a different taxon, solid lines). The figure also emphasizes three dates in which many assignments change, in accordance to the release of particular complete genomes of importance for the description of these microbial communities.</p>

            <p>The EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) offers public access to patent sequence data, providing a valuable service to the intellectual property and scientific communities. The non-redundant (NR) patent sequence databases comprise two-level nucleotide and protein sequence clusters (NRNL1, NRNL2, NRPL1 and NRPL2) based on sequence identity (level-1) and patent family (level-2). Annotation from the source entries in these databases is merged and enhanced with additional information from the patent literature and biological context. Corrections in patent publication numbers, kind-codes and patent equivalents significantly improve the data quality. Data are available through various user interfaces including web browser, downloads via FTP, SRS, Dbfetch and EBI-Search. Sequence similarity/homology searches against the databases are available using BLAST, FASTA and PSI-Search. In this article, we describe the data collection and annotation and also outline major changes and improvements introduced since 2009. Apart from data growth, these changes include additional annotation for singleton clusters, the identifier versioning for tracking entry change and the entry mappings between the two-level databases.</p>
            <p>(3) Sequence similarity/homology searches including FASTA (11), BLAST <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref> and PSI-Search ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) against the databases are available through the web form submissions (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/sss/) and also through the corresponding EMBL-EBI SOAP/REST web services <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) Keyword searches can be made using the EBI-Search engine <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> through both a web form (http://www. ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch) and the corresponding SOAP web services.</p>

            <p>To determine miRNA scores, the mean fold change of all the miRNAs belonging to each specific analysis (D-HF vs. CTR, ND-HF vs. CTR, and ND-HF vs. D-HF) was calculated for each patient and the minus sign was inverted before calculating the mean. Bioinformatic analysis. Bioinformatic prediction of miRNA target genes was performed using miRonTop <ref type="bibr">(26,27)</ref>. Predicted miRNA target genes were compared with differently expressed genes (P # 0.01) displaying an opposite modulation with their corresponding miRNA. The correlation analysis between mRNA and miRNA expression was evaluated by the quantitative trait tool in BRB-ArrayTools (P # 0.01).</p>
            <p>Next, experimentally validated and predicted targets of each miRNA were analyzed, and mRNA/miRNA couples displaying reciprocal modulation were selected. Statistical analysis allowed the identification of 140, 329, and 11 miRNA/mRNA interactions in the D-HF versus CTR, ND-HF versus CTR, and D-HF versus ND-HF groups, respectively (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). A subset of the identified miRNAtarget modulations was further validated by qRT-PCR in cardiac biopsies (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) and in a cell culture system (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Gene interaction and pathway analysis of global gene expression changes. To facilitate the interpretation of the complex gene expression changes observed in the different experimental groups, we used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (IPA), exploring for enriched biological functions and pathways. We applied a low-stringency approach, prioritizing sensitivity to maximize the identification of the potentially involved categories.</p>

            <p>To search for ENC orthologs in sequenced invertebrate genomes, we explored public databases. Predicted peptide sequences of Nematostella vectensis, Trichoplax adherens, Helobdella robusta, Capitella teleta, Lottia gigantea, Daphnia pulex, Branchiostoma floridae (all accessible at the DOE Joint Genome Institute: http://www.jgi.doe.gov/, last accessed July 24, 2013) and of Schistosoma mansoni (ftp://ftp.sanger. ac.uk/pub/pathogens/Schistosoma/mansoni/genome/gene_ predictions/, last accessed July 24, 2013) were downloaded, and local Blast searches using human ENC1 protein as query were performed. Invertebrate sequences with high similarity scores were included in the phylogenetic analysis (fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p>
            <p>We analyzed the genomic regions up to 10 Mb flanking the three chicken ENC genes to search for conserved intragenomic synteny as instructed by <ref type="bibr">Kuraku and Meyer (2012)</ref>. Using the Ensembl "Gene Tree," we selected only pairs, triplets, or quartets of paralogous genes that show a gene duplication pattern in accordance with the 2R-WGD <ref type="bibr">(Dehal and Boore 2005)</ref>. The conserved synteny is depicted in figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p>
            <p>Because the chicken ENC3 gene sequence was incomplete with a stretch of "N"s in the open reading frame (ORF) of ENSGALG00000024263 (Ensembl genome database: http:// www.ensembl.org, last accessed July 24, 2013; release 64; <ref type="bibr">Hubbard et al. 2009</ref>), we performed a reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR with gene-specific primers and sequenced the missing part. By aligning the overlapping regions of the deduced protein sequences of the newly obtained fragment and the incomplete sequence in Ensembl, we detected an amino acid substitution. The comparison with other vertebrate ENC proteins clearly showed that this is a highly conserved residue (asparagine). Therefore, we assume that the lysine residue of the Ensembl chicken ENC3 protein was caused by a sequencing error, which is also plausible with respect to the stretch of "N"s. The curated cDNA fragment is deposited in EMBL under accession number HE981758.</p>

Merkel Cell Polyomavirus DNA was detected in both tumors of patient (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> A) and 309 bp putative PCR product was cloned into the pTZ57R/T PCR cloning vector (InsTAclone&#8482; PCR cloning Kit, Fermentas, MD, USA), then submitted for sequencing (Bioneer, Daejeon, South Korea). The sequences were aligned with reference sequences of MCPyV (MCC350, MCC339, TKS, MKL-1) using the National Center for Biotechnology Information Blast algorithm. The sequences were deposited in GenBank with the Accession Numbers KF442250 and KF442251.

            <p>The short genomic reads used in the study are deposited at DDBJ-SRA under accession ID PRJDB4103. The scaffolds for the Hordeum vulgare cv. Haruna Nijo are available at http://barleyflc.dna.affrc.go.jp/ bexdb/pages/harunanijo_index.jsp for download. Genome browsing of the Haruna Nijo gene models are available on GBrowse [(http:// gmod.org/wiki/GBrowse) <ref type="bibr">38</ref> at http://barleyflc.dna.affrc.go.jp/gb2/ gbrowse/HarunaNijo_genome/.21]. All scaffolds were concatenated by 100 'Ns' from the longer scaffolds. Haruna Nijo scaffolds, FLcDNAs, RNA-Seq genes, repeat information, Morex contigs and Morex HC/LC genes are displayed (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). From the Haruna Nijo genome browser, FLcDNA annotation data and Morex genome browser of bex-db could be accessed (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). Moreover, users can access the Haruna Nijo genome from FLcDNA information of bex-db.</p>
            <p>FLcDNA mapping on genome sequence provides reliable exon vs. intron structures on gene models. A non-redundant set of 28,620 FLcDNA sequences <ref type="bibr">13,14</ref> was mapped to the Haruna Nijo scaffolds. Blastn mapping revealed that 27,784 FLcDNAs (97%) showed sequence similarities with the Haruna Nijo scaffolds. According to the results of the FLcDNA mapping to scaffolds, we analysed mapping coverage of 5&#8242;-end of each FLcDNA on Haruna Nijo scaffolds. The ratio of completely mapped FLcDNAs, which were mapped from the first nucleotide sequence, was &lt;10%. This shows that most of the FLcDNAs do not have the complete sequences on the 5&#8242;-end side exon. To analyse additional mapped FLcDNAs, we relaxed the mapping position to the first 10 nucleotide sequences. Then, the ratio of mapped FLcDNA was raised to 80% (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S3</ref>). GC contents and CG-skew were analysed on the FLcDNAs having mapped 5&#8242;-ends within 10 bp. The typical high GC contents and CG-skewed peaks at the transcription start sites were identified as previously observed in rice and Arabidopsis 32 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S4</ref>).</p>
            <p>2.5. FLcDNA/RNA-Seq mapping 2.5.1. FLcDNA mapping Of the two independent projects, 13,14 5,006 FLcDNAs were retrieved from NCBI <ref type="bibr">13</ref> and 23,614 FLcDNAs <ref type="bibr">14</ref> were downloaded from the bex-db (http://barleyflc.dna.affrc.go.jp/bexdb/). <ref type="bibr">21</ref> Morex genome assembly (contigs) was retrieved from the PGSB PlantsDB database (http://pgsb.helmholtz-muenchen.de/plant/plantsdb.jsp, 7 November 2015, date accessed). <ref type="bibr">3</ref> FLcDNAs were mapped both on the Haruna Nijo scaffolds and on the Morex contigs using blast+ with the parameters '-task blastn -evalue 10e &#8722;10 -lcase_masking', and with est2genome <ref type="bibr">22</ref> in the EMBOSS package with the parameters '-align -mode both -gappenalty 8 -mismatch 6 -minscore 10'. FLcDNAs mapped to scaffolds with &gt;95% identity and &gt;50% coverage were accepted. Mapped regions with the highest identity were adopted for each FLcDNA. Overlapped FLcDNA sequences were clustered onto a locus on Haruna Nijo genome.</p>
            <p>tRNAs were also annotated by tRNAscan-SE. The spectrum of tRNA distribution across the genome was uneven but similar to the rice genome <ref type="bibr">37</ref> (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>). It is reported that tRNA Lys sequences are extraordinarily abundant in wheat chromosome 6B due tothe abundance of the retrotransposon Gypsy. <ref type="bibr">35</ref> The Haruna Nijo scaffolds also have higher rate of Gypsy; however, the number of tRNAs was smaller than that in wheat.</p>
            <p>From the silva database <ref type="bibr">29</ref> (http://www.arb-silva.de/, 7 November 2015, date accessed), 17 barley rRNA sequences were downloaded. They were mapped on the Haruna Nijo scaffolds using blast+ with the parameters '-task blastn -evalue 0.01 -lcase_masking -num_descriptions 100' and blast hits with &gt;98% identity and &gt;50% coverage were assumed as rRNAs. tRNA genes were predicted using the tRNAscan-SE ver. 1.3.1 program. <ref type="bibr">30</ref> Any tRNAs that were annotated as 'possible pseudogenes' were not counted.</p>
            <p>Human, fungi (33 species) and microbial (2,777 species) nucleotide sequence data were obtained from NCBI. Each assembled contig sequence was queried on sequences of these species, and the contigs showing &gt;80% identity and &gt;50% of cumulative coverage by blastn <ref type="bibr">16</ref> were assumed as alien sequences against the barley genome. For repeat masking, fasta files of Triticeae repeat sequence database (TREP Release 10: n = 1,717) were downloaded from GrainGenes (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ITMI/ Repeats/, 7 November 2015, date accessed). In addition, new repetitive elements were generated from the Haruna Nijo genome assembly by RepeatModeler (http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler.html, 7 November 2015, date accessed). These two libraries were used for repeat masking the Haruna Nijo assembly by censor <ref type="bibr">17</ref> with -mode norm mode. For the analysis of repeat distribution, only results of repeat masking by the TREP library were used. For comparison, genomes of Triticum aestivum, <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Triticum urartu <ref type="bibr">19</ref> and Aegilops tauschii <ref type="bibr">20</ref> were repeat masked in a similar manner as the Haruna Nijo genome.</p>

            <p>In order to find more ZAS factors that are sensitive to thiol oxidation, close homologs of ScoRsrA in NCBI nr database (as of 8 November 2008) were searched by BlastP. Only the ASD corresponding to 103 amino acids of ScoRsrA was compared. Using a cutoff E-value of 0.3, 114 candidates were retrieved (See Supplementary Table S3 for sequence information). Most of them are from actinobacteria, except four; Rmet_0596 (Ralstonia metallidurans CH34, Betaproteobacteria), CHU_0600 (Cytophaga hutchinsonii ATCC 33406, Bacteroidetes), Ccel_0804 (Clostridium cellulolyticum H10, Firmicutes) and Ctha_1264 (Chloroherpeton thalassium ATCC 35110, Chlorobi). The list included reported ZAS factors such as RshA from M. tuberculosis (12,17,27) and a predicted ZAS RshA from C. glutamicum <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref>. Except for NCgl0852 from C. glutamicum, all ZAS genes are adjacent to ECF sigma factor genes. In M. tuberculosis and M. bovis strains, genes for ZAS (RshA) and sigma factor (SigH) are separated by a hypothetical ORF.</p>

            <p>The study was done under CARTO 3D electroanatomic mapping guidance, keeping the possibility of epicardial pathway (as recent attempts of ablation by conventional mapping failed). The study was carried out with one quadripolar catheter for the His region and one mapping catheter. Orthrodromic reentrant tachycardia (ORT) was easily and repeatedly induced with programmed extrastimulation, with a cycle length of 350msecs. Mapping was performed during sinus rhythm (SR) as well as during tachycardia. Earliest atrial activation during ORT was in right anterolateral region. Good signals were obtained with fused A and V in a relatively broad area in anterolateral tricuspid annulus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). However, multiple radiofrequency (RF) energies (10e30 s; 43 ; 30 W) at these sites, using 3.5 mm tip, 7.5F (Biosense Webster's Navistar, D curve) catheter failed to terminate the tachycardia.</p>

            <p>Zusammenfassend ist aus unserer Sicht die &#220;bertragung des POL-Prinzips in den virtuellen Raum m&#246;glich und wir werten die ersten Ergebnisse insgesamt als Erfolg f&#252;r die Studierenden, die Lehrenden und das Fach Nuklearmedizin. Obwohl insbesondere der POL-Ansatz f&#252;r Dozenten und Studierende Zeit-intensiv ist und die technische Seite anf&#228;nglich Probleme bereitet hat, bietet das geschilderte Konzept doch die M&#246;glichkeit der breiteren Vermittlung von nuklearmedizinischen Grundkenntnissen. Allerdings erscheint es insbesondere in der Gruppenphase schwierig, die Interaktion zwischen den Studierenden rein virtuell zu gestalten, da die Limitationen in der Kommunikationsform als schwierig empfunden wurden, so dass in vier von f&#252;nf Seminaren auch pers&#246;nliche Treffen der Studierenden stattgefunden haben. Es bleibt abzuwarten, ob mit der zunehmenden online-Sozialisation der Studierenden dieses Hindernis &#252;berwunden werden kann, oder ob das Seminar in der Konsequenz auf den Studienort beschr&#228;nkt bleiben wird, um weiterhin den pers&#246;nlichen Kontakt zu erm&#246;glichen. Dennoch erscheint uns das virtuelle POL Seminar als eine interessante Erg&#228;nzung der Lehre, die es dar&#252;ber hinaus erm&#246;glicht, motivierte Studierende f&#252;r das Fach Nuklearmedizin zu interessieren und mittelfristig vielleicht auch zu gewinnen <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[14]</ref>. Um dieses zu erreichen, muss im weiteren Verlauf auch diskutiert werden, wie eine m&#246;glichst breite Einbindung der Studierenden zu erreichen ist. In den von uns durchgef&#252;hrten Pilotkursen -in denen es prim&#228;r um die Frage der Machbarkeit eines virtuellen POL und erste Erfahrungen ging -war das Seminar komplett freiwillig und wurde, im Vergleich zu der Anzahl von Studierenden die auf moodle-Seite zugegriffen haben, nur relativ wenig genutzt. Diese Erfahrung deckt sich mit denen der AG "Computerunterst&#252;tzte Lehr-und Lernsysteme in der Medizin" in der Deutsche Gesellschaft f&#252;r Medizinische Informatik, Biometrie und Epidemiologie e.V. (GMDS), die beschreibt, dass nur ca. 5% der Studierenden die verf&#252;gbaren e-Learning-Systeme im Rahmen ihres Selbststudiums nutzten [zitiert nach <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. Eine Studie zum fallbasierten System CASUS gibt zu bedenken, dass ein wesentlicher Grund f&#252;r die fehlende studentische Nutzung von e-Learning Ressourcen in der fehlenden Relevanz f&#252;r die Studierenden zu suchen ist. In der Untersuchung aus M&#252;nchen wurden die F&#228;lle von fast allen Studierenden vollst&#228;ndig bearbeitet, sobald deren Bearbeitung mit der Vergabe von "Credit Points" verbunden war und damit f&#252;r die Studierenden pr&#252;fungsrelevant. Im Falle des Selbststudiums, bei dem keine "Credit Points" vergeben wurden, traf dies nur noch auf ca. 10% der Studierenden zu <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. Es ist davon auszugehen, dass diese Schlussfolgerung auch auf das virtuelle POL zutrifft. In den kommenden Semestern soll vor diesem Hintergrund versucht werden, das POL Seminar st&#228;rker in der Lehre zu verankern, beispielsweise indem interessierte Studierende bereits in den Pr&#228;senzseminaren oder &#252;ber den moodle-Kurs "Molekulare Bildgebung" gezielter angesprochen werden. L&#228;ngerfristig &#252;berlegen wir dar&#252;ber </p>
            <p>In summary, in our view, the transfer of the POL principle to virtual reality is possible and we judge the first results as a success for the students, teachers and the subject of nuclear medicine overall. Although the POL approach is time-intensive, in particular for teachers and students and created technical problems initially, the described concept has the potential for wider communication of basic knowledge in nuclear medicine. However, it seems difficult, especially in the group phase, to operate purely on virtual interaction between the students as the limitations of this communication form were felt to be difficult, so that in four of the five seminars face-to-face meetings of the students also took place. It remains to be seen whether this can be overcome by the growing online socialisation of students or whether the seminar consequently will be limited to the study site to continue to enable personal contact. Nevertheless, we view virtual POL seminars as an interesting addition to teaching which make it possible to interest motivated students in the subject of nuclear medicine and in the medium, perhaps to win over <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[14]</ref>. To achieve this, it must be discussed in the following how the widest possible involvement of students can be achieved. In the pilot courses conducted by us, which were primarily about the feasibility of virtual POL and first experiences, the seminar was completely voluntary and, in comparison to the number of students who access the moodle site, relatively little used. This experience is consistent with those of the working group on "Computerassisted teaching and learning systems in medicine" in of the German Society for Medical Computer Science, Biometry and Epidemiology (GMDS), which reports that only about 5% of students took advantage of the available e-learning systems as part of their self-studies [quoted from <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>]. A study on the case-based CASUS system points out that a main reason for the lack of student use of e-learning is linked to the lack of relevance to the students. In the Munich study, cases were worked upon by all students as soon as this was linked to "credit points" and thus relevant for the students' exams. In case of pure self-study, where no credits were awarded, this occurred with only 10% of students <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. It is likely that these conclusions also apply to virtual POL. In the coming semesters an attempt will be therefore to anchor the POL seminar in teaching more strongly, for example by approaching interested students in the presence seminars or on the moodle course "Molecular Imaging" already. In the longer term, we are considering the introduction of structural changes by integrating the course in the curriculum and extending it beyond the specialist subject of nuclear medicine to the full range of diagnostic imaging, in particular radiology. In doing so, the course would not only become more attractive to students but for the teaching staff it could become a focal point for new approaches to teaching that go beyond one's own subject.</p>

            <p>Secondary structures of TTLL12 wild-type and new 36AA plus isoform. Secondary structures of the TTLL12 wild-type and TTLL12 36AA plus isoform were predicted by DNAStar Protean and online tool CFSSP. As a result, the total residues of &#945;-Helix , &#946;-sheet and &#946;-turn in the TTLL12 wild-type were 476, 428 and 72, and the corresponding percentages were 73.9, 66.5 and 11.2%, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">6A</ref>). While total residues of &#945;-Helix, &#946;-sheet and &#946;-turn in the TTLL12 36AA plus isoformwere 504, 455 and 75, and the corresponding percentages were 74.1, 66.9 and 11.0%, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">6B</ref>). The results showed that the proportions of different types of secondary structures in these two TTLL12 proteins were slightly different (Table <ref type="table">II</ref>).</p>
            <p>The additional 36AA is involved in a disordered region of TTLL12. To ascertain whether the additional 36AA in the TTLL12 36AA plus isoform is in a disordered region of TTLL12, we firstly sought the disordered regions of the TTLL12 36AA plus isoform by the opening accessible online resources DisProt search, and found that the peptide of 260AA to 299AA in the TTLL12 36AA plus isoform was highly identical to the disordered region of Bcl-2-like protein 11 (B2L11) (Fig. <ref type="figure">7A</ref>), suggesting this peptide could act as a disordered region in thethat the additional 36AA was partly identical to the disordered region of brain natriuretic peptide-32 (BNP-32) (Fig. <ref type="figure">7B</ref>), giving the possibility that the 36AA could endow TTLL12 with new functions by acting as part of the disordered region. However, the biological functions of the new TTLL12 isoform in cancers remain to be further investigated.</p>

            <p>To determine the sensitivity of TNBC cell lines and T47D to EGFR inhibition, MET inhibition, and combined therapy inhibition, breast cancer cell lines were treated with gefitinib (0.25-8 umol/L), EMD 121463 (2-10 umol/L), or both agents given at the same concentration in combination for 72 hours. GI 50 of these cell lines were 1-5 uM to gefitinib and 4uM-&#8805;10uM to EMD 121463. These cell lines were essentially resistant to both gefitinib and EMD 121463 as single agents. The inhibitory effect of combined treatment with gefitinib and EMD 121463 was significantly enhanced compared with single agent therapy in MDA-MB-468 cells (P=0.002) but not in the other cell lines (MDA-MB-231, HCC1395, and T47D) (Fig <ref type="figure">1</ref>). However, when data were analyzed in Calcusyn software, synergism was also documented at different concentration combinations in the other cell lines (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).

            <p>The cytotoxic effects from MTS assays were entered into Calcusyn software <ref type="bibr">(Biosoft, Ferguson, MO)</ref> to determine whether the treatment combinations had synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects with the Chou-Talalay method <ref type="bibr">(Chou and Talalay, 1984)</ref>. When the CI value is less than 1, it indicates synergistic effects, and the lower the CI, the stronger the synergism.</p>
            <p>We examined the effects of ABT-737 alone or in combination with Bortezomib for treating A375 and WM852c human melanoma cells using MTS assays to measure relative cell viability. We found that ABT-737 alone at 1.1 mM caused no cytotoxicity, consistent with results shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>, but ABT-737 increased the effect of Bortezomib on relative cell viability (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A,B</ref>). To quantify whether these drug combinations exhibited synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects, we used Calcusyn software to calculate the combination index (CI) value for each experimental combination (supplementary material Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>). CI values less than, equal to, or greater than one indicate synergy, additivity, or antagonism, respectively. Most of the CI values were less than 0.7 (indicating synergy), and many CI values were less than 0.3 (indicating strong synergy). These results show that a majority of the combination conditions of ABT-737 with Bortezomib displayed strong synergistic killing effects for these melanoma cell lines (supplementary material Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).

            <p>According to international guidelines, patients with ICDs should be followed at 3-month intervals, depending on the device model and the patient's clinical status. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> As no adverse events were reported during the 9-month study period, remote monitoring with the Medtronic CareLink service was proven safe. This indicates that at least two of four routine in-office ICD follow-up visits can be replaced by remote monitoring without compromising patient safety.</p>
            <p>Forty-one patients (34 males and 7 females) with a previously implanted ICD supported by the Medtronic CareLink remote-monitoring service were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 62 + 10 years (range 41-76 years). The indication for the ICD implantation was secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death in 37 (90%) patients and primary prevention in 4 (10%) patients. Thirty patients (73%) had prior myocardial infarction and 5 (12%) had dilated cardiomyopathy. Most of the patients were in stable clinical condition as only one patient (2%) had New York Heart Association III symptoms and no patients were in class IV (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). The most common symptoms at study inclusion included occasional dyspnoea (32%) and palpitations (34%). The implanted devices consisted of Medtronic GEM family VR (n &#188; 21) and DR (n &#188; 3), Marquis VR (n &#188; 6), Maximo DR (n &#188; 3) and VR (n &#188; 6), and biventricular InSync ICD (n &#188; 2).</p>

            <p>In this study, we report the first experiences in Europe with the Medtronic CareLink TM system. The system consists of a portable patient monitor, a central database in a secure server, and a password-protected website, where clinicians can view and analyse patient's device data (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Our aim was to provide comprehensive data on the safety, clinical practicability, and cost-effectiveness of remote ICD monitoring in an area characterized by long travelling distances to the device clinic. The economic impact of remote ICD monitoring was evaluated by comparing the direct and indirect costs of remote follow-up to those of standard clinical practice.</p>

            <p>To further confirm the inhibitory effect of Hath1 on KUMA5 cells, the rate of apoptosis was examined by Annexin V and PI staining of KUMA5 cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1-Hath1, pGenesil-1-Hath1, pGenesil-1 scramble control or a blank control. FITC-Annexin V and PI were added to the fixed cells for 20 min in darkness at room temperature. Subsequently, Annexin V binding buffer was added to the mixture prior to measuring the fluorescence using a FACSort flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cell apoptosis was analyzed using CellQuest 3.0 software (Becton Dickinson). The results demonstrated that a significantly higher rate of apoptosis was present in the KUMA5 cells overexpressing Hath1 compared with that of the control groups (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). In addition, a significantly lower rate of apoptosis was observed in the KUMA5 cells transfected with pGenesil-1-Hath1 compared with that of the control groups (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). Therefore, these results suggest that overexpression of Hath1 may promote apoptosis in KUMA5 cells.</p>

Cells harvested from the cultures were stained with the following monoclonal antibodies (mAbs): FITC-conjugated mouse anti-human CD1a mAb (clone NA1/34-HLK, Serotec, Oxford, U.K.), rat anti-canine MHC class II mAb (clone YKIX.334.2, Serotec), PE-Cy5-conjugated mouse anti-human CD14 mAb (clone T&#220;K4, Serotec), biotin conjugated rat anti-mouse CD80 mAb (clone 1G10, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, U.S.A.) and mouse anti-human CD86 mAb (clone FUN-1, Becton Dickinson). Staining with biotin conjugated mAb was followed by incubation with streptavidin-PerCP-Cy5.5 (Becton Dickinson). Before staining, the anti-CD86 mAb was labeled by PE conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probe) for 5 min at room temperature. The excess of PE-goat anti-mouse IgG was neutralized by excess purified mouse IgG (Sigma). After the staining, the cells were fixed and analyzed using a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur&#8482;: Becton Dickinson). Background of the fluorescence was adjusted using following isotype-control: FITC-conjugated mouse IgG2a (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, U.S.A.), FITCconjugated rat IgG2a (eBioscience) and biotin-conjugated rat IgG2a (eBioscience). To determine the expression intensity of the surface antigens specified above, the mean peak channel of the fluorescence intensity was calculated by software (CellQuest&#8482;: Becton Dickinson) after the FCM analysis and expressed as mean expression intensity (MEI).</p>

            <p>The inhibitory effect of compounds on IDO cannot imply a similar influence on tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), because structural homology between TDO and IDO is rather limited, Uniprot identity 12.357%, ( http: // www.uniprot.org / uniprot / ?query = reviewed%3Ayes ), ClustalW alignment score &#8722;14 ( http: // www.ebi.ac.uk / Tools / msa / clustalw2 / ). While both the enzymes act via an activated heme, the binding pocket anatomy is very different <ref type="bibr">[ 24 , 25 ]</ref>. We assume it is unlikely that compounds like arctigenin or trachelogenin would also bind to TDO.</p>
            <p>The possible direct interaction of the three lignans with IDO was simulated, 3D geometries of trachelogenin, arctigenin, and matairesinol were calculated with Discovery Studio <ref type="bibr">[ 13 ]</ref> and energetically minimized with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator25" type="software" xml:id="edbdad4810-software-6">Omega</rs> <rs corresp="#edbdad4810-software-6" resp="#annotator25" type="version">2.2.1</rs>. <ref type="bibr">[ 14 ]</ref>.

A pharmacophore of the metal binding feature was generated within LigandScout 3.03 <ref type="bibr">[ 17 ]</ref> based on the ligand (4-phenyl-imidazole) cocrystallized in the crystal structure and used as a constraint in the docking simulation. This means that the docked ligand must form a coordinated interaction with the heme iron ion from the IDO active site. For the docking, the A chain of 2d0t, which was crystallized as a dimer, was used. The original ligand 4-phenyl-imidazole, the two co-crystallized detergent molecules of 2-[ N -cyclohexylamino]ethane sulfonic acid, and water were removed. The binding site of the original ligand was chosen for the docking. The program defines the open space in the binding pocket with so called alpha spheres that represent available atom positions. Placement was done by the triangle matcher algorithm using standard settings. The triangle matcher algorithm generates poses by aligning triplets of ligand atoms with triplets of alpha spheres to find possible binding orientations of the ligand within the binding site.</p>

The London scoring function estimates the free energy of a pose by forming a sum of energy term (considering ligand flexibility, H-bonds and desolvation) and geometric imperfections. The GBVI / WSA estimates the electrostatic solvation using a weighted solvent-accessible surface area.

            <p>As an alternate test we explored the association of the genes in the various lists to cancer using the Genetic Association Database (geneticassociationdb.nih.gov/). Their association with the 'cancer' category was determined using the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources <ref type="bibr">(24)</ref>. As shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, the KC-SMART results also show a significant association with cancer (P &lt; 0.05) for this database.</p>
            <p>To the best of our knowledge, the only method that encompasses a statistical framework and has readily available software to perform multiexperiment aCGH data analysis is STAC <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref>. Several remarks can be made on the comparison between STAC and KC-SMART. STAC results are dependent on the manner in which the two STAC statistics are combined. Results for both the statistics (footprint and frequency) can be very different. This disparity complicated the interpretation and might lead to results-oriented use of statistics. Furthermore, STAC bases the background-distribution of their statistical tests on local chromosome-arm permutation. This means that recurrent loss or gain of whole-chromosome arms cannot be detected. A prime example of this is the well-known gain of human 1q which was not identified as statistically significant by STAC. Also, basing the background distribution just on the chromosome arm is not a correct representation of the biological reality, where the exact position of a gain or amplification is not known and could be located on a completely different chromosome arm. To get a better average background distribution, permutation over the entire genome is preferable.</p>
            <p>of chromosome arms. This could point to a bias in the algorithm for boundary regions. To investigate the nature of the significant regions detected by STAC but not by KC-SMART, we analyzed the raw log2 values and compared them to the discretized values produced by Chin et al. <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>. Two examples of this analysis are shown in the Supplementary Data. Generally, the areas exclusively detected by STAC are scored as single copy alterations by the MergeLevels analysis done by Chin et al. <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>. On a log2 scale these gains and losses were very small indeed ($0.1), but nevertheless large enough to be assigned a value of 1 or &#192;1, and are therefore treated equally to large gains and losses. This discrete approach, which neglects the amplitude of an aberration can therefore be considered to be less conservative than KC-SMART and can/may therefore yield more falsepositives.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, KC-SMART performs better than STAC <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref>, the only other statistically-based method currently available. Using aCGH and expression data from a novel dataset of 19 mammary tumors from a conditional mouse model of sporadic breast cancer, we identify several cancer genes, and we show that complex aberrations can be analyzed by varying the width of the kernel function. Finally, we propose several new cancer gene candidates based on KC-SMART results.</p>

            <p>Aristolochic acids (AAs) are the active components of herbal drugs derived from Aristolochia species that have been used for medicinal purposes since antiquity. However, AAs have recently been discovered to be highly nephrotoxic and induced urothelial cancer in humans and malignant tumors in the kidney and urinary tract of rodents. In this study, we exposed rat renal proximal tubule cells in vitro to a sub-cytotoxic level of AAs at three different time points (6 h, 24 h and 72 h). We then analyzed the gene expression profile after the compound exposure. Functional analysis with Ingenuity Pathways Analysis and DAVID tools revealed that at the late time point (72 h) there are many significantly altered genes involved in cancer-related pathways such as p53 signaling. MIAMI-compliant microarray data are deposited in the NCBI GEO database under accession number GSE68687 and can be found at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68687.</p>
            <p>The intensity values of different genes (probe sets) generated by Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software were imported into GeneSpring   version 11 software (Agilent) for data analysis. The raw data files (CEL files) containing signal values for individual probes were pre-processed to generate one value per probeset. Pre-processing of arrays was done using GC-RMA (Robust Multiarray Analysis algorithm). To identify the differentially expressed (DE) probe sets, two sampled t-test (unpaired t-test) with a P-value b 0.05 and Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing correction and a fold cut off of 2 was used. Comparisons were made between control DMSO-exposed and AA-exposed cells. Three studies were conducted at each time point.</p>

            <p>Zinc finger nucleases were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) with DNA-binding sequences in the 5&#8242;-3&#8242; direction of CGC-CTGATGGTCCCT and CACTCGGGTGCGTGTGTT. TALENs were from Cellectis Bioresearch (Romainville, France) with DNA-binding domains in the 5&#8242;-3&#8242; direction of TTCACTCGGGTGCGTGT and TATGTATAGGGGAAAGA. The donor plasmid consisted of mEGFP cDNA sequence flanked by a left homology arm (ENSEMBL release 75, ENST00000316199, chromosome 17:8108992-8108191) and a right homology arm (ENSEMBL release 75, ENST00000316199, chromosome 17:8107923-8108440), consisting of AURKB genomic sequence. ZFN/TALEN and donor plasmid transfection was with jetPRIME reagent (Polyplus, Illkirch-Graffenstaden, France). We incubated 0.5 &#956;g of each ZFN/TALEN and 1 &#956;g of donor plasmid for 15 min with 200 &#956;l of jetPRIME buffer and 4 &#956;l of jetPRIME before addition to cells grown to 80% confluency in a six-well dish with 2 ml of growth medium. After 4 h, the transfection mix was changed to normal medium.</p>

            <p>In order to assess the effect of policy reforms on each of our well-being concepts, we simulate four hypothetical policy reforms. As described before, we use EUROMOD to simulate disposable incomes and Eqs. 2-7 to derive the effects on life satisfaction and equivalent incomes. In all counterfactual scenarios, budget neutrality is achieved by an increase in the top tax rate of the government income tax, which is 25% in Sweden. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> The different scenarios are described in detail in Section 4.1. The following subsections discuss the average gains and losses, the resulting inequality in well-being and the effects on social welfare. All results are based on the estimates of Model 2 in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p>
            <p>In order to calculate household disposable income under different policy reform scenarios, we use EUROMOD, the EU tax-benefit microsimulation model. EUROMOD simulates cash benefit entitlements and direct personal tax and social insurance contribution liabilities on the basis of the tax-benefit rules in place in each of the 28 EU Member States. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> The underlying micro-data used for the simulations in EUROMOD is EU-SILC, which contains detailed information on different income sources as well as household and individual characteristics.</p>

            <p>This article has proposed an analysis of welfare reform in European countries using a simple static model of labour supply and the EUROMOD microsimulation model. Following the findings of the empirical labour supply literature, we have modelled labour supply responses not just along the intensive margin (as done by most previous policy reform studies) but also along the extensive margin. Our analysis leads to quite <ref type="bibr">30</ref> In the case of the working poor policy, the non-working population is excluded as it is unaffected by the policy.</p>
            <p>For the hours-of-work elasticity, we will assume that it is constant across income deciles, as <ref type="bibr">Diamond (1998)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Saez (2001)</ref>. We will take an elasticity equal to 0.1 to be our baseline case, but will also consider values equal to 0 and 0.2. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> To allow interested readers to compute efficiency measures using under the behavioural elasticity parameters of their choice, we have constructed a spreadsheet file incorporating the relevant simulation formulas. The file also contains detailed EUROMOD results on the tax rates for each demographic and earnings group. It is posted on the EUROMOD website, on the personal webpages of the authors, and as an electronic Appendix to the published article at http://www.res.org.uk/economic/ta/ tahome.asp.</p>
            <p>Using the EUROMOD model, we first provide a description of the incentives to work generated by taxes and transfers along the extensive and intensive margins at each decile of the earnings distribution. Second and most important, we evaluate the equityefficiency tradeoff for two simple reforms corresponding to the old and new debates on welfare reform described above. We calibrate the elasticities of labour supply along the intensive and extensive margins using estimates from the empirical literature, and a careful sensitivity analysis will be provided. Like <ref type="bibr">Browning and Johnson (1984)</ref> and others, we measure the equity-efficiency trade-off by the ratio of the &#212;euro value&#213; of the welfare loss for those who lose from the reform to the &#212;euro value&#213; of the welfare gain for those who gain. In other words, we calculate the number of units it would cost the rich to transfer an additional unit to the poor or the working poor.</p>
            <p>The EUROMOD microsimulation model combines a tax and benefits calculator with detailed country-specific, but partly harmonised, micro data on income, earnings, labour force participation, as well as many demographic variables. For any set of household characteristics and country, EUROMOD is able to calculate the amount of benefits the household is entitled to and the taxes it should pay. EUROMOD has been constructed to incorporate all relevant tax and transfer programmes in place in all countries that were members of the European Union prior to May 1, 2004. It is therefore a unique tool to obtain a complete picture of the incentives to work generated by those programmes as well as the analysis of welfare reform. An introduction to EUROMOD and a descriptive analysis of taxes and transfers in the EU countries has been provided by <ref type="bibr">Sutherland (2001)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Immervoll (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Immervoll and O'Donoghue (2003)</ref>.</p>

An assay quantifying the methylation levels of five representative CpG sites in the BRCA1 promoter was designed using the PyroMark Assay Design 2.0 software (Qiagen). A 232 bp amplicon (HSA17: 41,277,292-41,277,523 bps; Ensembl release 60) was PCR amplified from bisulfitetreated DNA using forward primer 5'-ATT TAG AGT AGA GGG TGA AGG-3' and biotinylated reverse primer 5'-TCT ATC CCT CCC ATC CTC TAA TT-3'. The reaction mixture consisted of 2.5 &#956;l 10x PCR buffer, 20 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 &#956;l 10 mM dNTP mix, 1 &#956;l (10 pmol) of each primer, 0.2 &#956;l (1 U) FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), 18.8 &#956;l PCR-grade water and 1 &#956;l (~100 ng) template DNA.

The protein concentration was measured according to Bradford, using Roti Quant (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). Customized antibody microarrays for quantification of BRCA1 (antibody #sc-1553, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) and several other DNA repair-associated proteins (ATM, BRCA2, MLH1, RAD51 and TP53) were prepared by spotting triplicate drops, each containing approximately 0.5 pg antibody onto nitrocellulose-coated slides (Oncyte, nitrocellulose 16 multi-pad slides, Grace Bio-Labs, Bend, OR), using a sciFLEX-ARRAYER 3 non-contact spotter (Scienion, Berlin, Germany). Antibodies against &#946;-actin (ACTB) (#A5441, Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) served as positive, spotting buffer as negative control. Slides were stored at 4&#176;C in dry condition. Nuclear proteins were labeled with an amine reactive fluorine dye, which forms a covalent amide bond between the primary amines of proteins. Two micrograms of protein and 0.12 &#956;l fluorescent dye (Dylight 649 NHS Ester, Pierce, Rockford, IL) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Then, excess fluorescent dye was inactivated by adding 100 mM glycine to the reaction. Prior to use, antibody microarrays were covered with 16-pad FAST frame hybridization chambers (Whatman, Maidstone, UK). Unspecific binding sites were blocked for 1 h at 4&#176;C with 120 &#956;l PBS containing 4% non-fat dry milk per subarray, followed by three washes with 120 &#956;l PBS each for 10 min. Labeled protein samples were incubated on subarrays overnight at 4&#176;C. Afterwards, the slides were washed two times for 15 min with PBS, 5% Tween 20 and two times for 15 min with HPLC-grade water. Finally, the slides were dried in a SpeedVac and scanned with a high-resolution confocal Affymetrix array scanner 428 TM (Affymetrix, High Wycombe, UK). Slide images were analyzed using the TM4 Spotfinder (version 3.1.1) software (Dana Faber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). Background subtraction was performed according to the formula: spot intensity = mean intensity SP -[(sum bkg -sum top25 bkg)/(number of pixelSP -number of pixel top25 bkg)], where SP represents any spot, bkg the corresponding background and top25 bkg the top 25% of background pixel. Microarray data were analyzed using log10 transformation, z score and z ratio calculations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">47</ref> Three biological replicates (using protein samples from different cell cultures of the affected and the healthy twin) were performed for each experiment.</p>

            <p>Structural measurements. Eyespot structures were analysed using digital microscopes VHX-1000 (Keyenece, Osaka, Japan) for high magnification pictures at the cellular level and by SKM-S30A-PC (Saitou Kougaku, Yokohama, Japan) for lower magnification pictures. Quantitative measurements of size and distance were performed using ImageJ <ref type="bibr">28</ref> and graphically presented and analysed using Microsoft Excel. Eyespot diameter and the width of a given ring and core were measured along the line that passes through the focus of that eyespot for the mandarin fish. Similar measurements were taken in the spotted ray except the black ring width, which was calculated by subtracting the core diameter from the whole eyespot size and then dividing it by a factor of two. Five representative eyespots from each array of an individual ray were used for the measurements.</p>

            <p>The TK data were used to estimate plasma C max , C min , and daily systemic dose (AUC 24 h ) of 2,4-D. The AUC 24 h was calculated from the 3 plasma samples extrapolated to 24 h assuming steady-state plasma concentrations and similar daily fluctuations of the systemic dose due to the feeding pattern of the rats <ref type="bibr">(McCoy et al., 2012; Saghir et al., 2006, 2012)</ref>. Dose-dependent TK behavior was determined graphically and by comparing ratios of plasma 2,4-D AUC 24 h at any selected dose to the lowest tested dose (100 ppm) and assuming linear TK behavior at the 100-ppm dose. The comparison was made both for the nominal (ie, ppm in diet) and the actual ingested (mg/kg/day) doses. Microsoft Excel was used to calculate TK parameters.</p>

            <p>Fold-change bias 95% confidence intervals were determined using Microsoft Excel 2010 for the Cq values illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref> and rounded-up to the closest 0.5Cq. We analyzed three different ranges of target abundance, average no PreAmp Cq value less than 30, between 30 and 32.5, and greater than 32.5. The limit of detection was estimated as 2-fold the 95% confidence interval. For example, if the fold-change 95% confidence interval for targets between 30 and 32.5 was calculated as 1.0Cq, then 2-fold this value is 2.0Cq, which represents a 4-fold change. Therefore, targets with a no PreAmp Cq value between 30 and 32.5 have a 4-fold change limit of detection.</p>

            <p>The research in which I have been involved draws on data from nontraditional sources: contacts with financial journalists and leads from consulting. The data on the hundreds of executives who were being spun by Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB, now known as just Credit Suisse), come from a government exhibit that was introduced in the prosecution of CSFB executive Frank Quattrone on obstructionof-justice charges. I became aware of the data when a financial journalist alerted me to the existence of the exhibit, an Excel spreadsheet that listed the name, corporate position, company, and a CSFB spinning priority code for individuals being spun as of March 2000, at the peak of the technology stock bubble. These accounts were popularly known as "Friend of Frank" accounts. This list was augmented by a separate list of 63 Friend of Frank accountholders who lived in Silicon Valley that ran in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">March 7, 2003</ref>, edition of the San Jose Mercury-News. This list, which included the names of executives of companies that had gone public after March 2000, overlapped with the names on the Excel spreadsheet, and contained the number of IPOs each executive received and the first-day profits on these allocations.</p>

            <p>To deal with these challenges, Middlebury has recently created a PoP program. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The program grew out of the existing Executive in Residence program, but expanded it significantly and made it much more focused on teaching, and on bringing the executives into the classroom than was the case previously. The PoP program is built on the assumption that the best people to teach the skills needed in a career are the people who have been successful in that career. So the PoP program brings in successful people who are at a point in their career when they want to give back to society by teaching students how the liberal arts are used in the real world. It pairs these professors of the practice with academic liberal arts professor sponsors. These sponsors work with the professors of the practice on teaching the course. They do so by giving the PoP suggestions and guidance in teaching. The sponsor's role is to insure that the course both maintains academic rigor and asks broad liberal arts questions in addition to providing contextual knowledge of the field being taught. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> For example, in Middlebury's accounting and budgeting course, students go back to Luigi Pacioli's introduction of double entry bookkeeping and consider how its general adoption fundamentally changed society. They also consider how accounting might change for triple bottom line corporations. In finance, in addition to becoming facile with dcf models in Excel, students consider the evolution of financial ideas over the last 50 years and how developments in the science of finance changed the practice of finance, not necessarily for the better.</p>

In cases in which the scanning protocol varied during the course of follow-up, the B-scan closest to the area of interest was matched manually and extracted for analysis. These extracted SD-OCT images were then stacked, aligned, and saved as a video file using the Fiji distribution (''Fiji is just Image J,'' http://fiji.sc; in the public domain) <ref type="bibr">22</ref> for the qualitative analysis of the progression of the lesion (see Supplementary Video).

            <p>Statistical analysis was carried out using the R programming language (R Core Team, 2012), version 2.15.1, on R-Cloud built on EBI 64bit Linux Cluster <ref type="bibr">(Kapushesky et al., 2010)</ref>. Demographic and clinical features were compared using parametric and non-parametric tests as appropriate. Principal component analysis (PCA) from the R 'base' package was used with visual inspection of PCA score-plot for the outlier detection <ref type="bibr">(Esbensen et al., 2002)</ref>. One subject was excluded during this procedure (see Results). The 'randomForest' package <ref type="bibr">(Liaw and Wiener, 2002)</ref> was used in further analysis.</p>
            <p>Image processing was performed at one site: Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences, IoP (KCL). Image quality control was performed using standardized procedures <ref type="bibr">(Simmons et al., 2011; Simmons et al., 2009)</ref>. Next, the raw 3D T1 MRI data underwent processing for surface-based cortex reconstruction and volumetric segmentation using the Freesurfer image analysis software (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) version 5.1 installed on a CentOS4 x86_64 cluster. There are several rationales for using Freesurfer in our study. Firstly, the surface-based registration approach incorporated into this software has been shown to have better reproducibility compared to Laplacian-or Registration-based methods for cortical thickness estimation <ref type="bibr">(Clarkson et al., 2011)</ref>. Secondly, this framework provides a range of different kinds of surface-based and volumetric measurements, as well as different parcellation atlases for extracting averaged morphometric data. The steps of this processing are described in detail elsewhere <ref type="bibr">(S&#233;gonne et al., 2007; S&#233;gonne et al., 2004; Fischl and Dale, 2000; Fischl et al., 1999; Dale et al., 1999; Sled et al., 1998)</ref>.</p>
            <p>The following parameters from the final models were reported to characterize performance: out-of-bag error (for the term definition see <ref type="bibr">Breiman, 2001)</ref>, area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity/specificity and overall accuracy on the testing datasets of AD, HC and MCI subjects (see "Subsampling"). ROC-curves of the best models were compared using DeLong3s test for two correlated ROCs, as implemented in the 'pROC' R-package <ref type="bibr">(Robin et al., 2011)</ref>.</p>

            <p>Our approach to the statistical data analysis could be named "harmonizing statistical evidences and predictions." It is rather fruitful because it combines not only confidence interval estimates for parameters, for the standardized effect size d C , for the achieved power (1-&#946;), and planned sample sizes, but prediction intervals for them and for pvalues, as well as estimates of posterior probabilities for the null hypothesis P(H 0 &#9474; D) and Bayes factors BF 10 . For parameter estimation and hypothesis testing the complementary combination of f requentist (orthodox) and Bayesian approaches was used. Nonparametric bootstrapping and permutation (Monte Carlo) procedures were realized with the number of replicates and/or random permutations as large as possible (but no less than 1 million). For measurable variables (stone size and density) medians and their 95% confidence limits were calculated.

            <p>To a certain extent, consumers do have some control over their private information. For example, a user can choose not to use websites that insert "cookies" that collect data on that user's machine (or choose to delete such "cookies" on a regular basis). Web browsers have increasingly provided mechanisms for consumers to control the retention of information on their browsing history and manage their cookies. Reviews of the recently released browsers in the market, Internet Explorer 8.0 and Google Chrome 2.0, emphasize new features such as private browsing and search suggestions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">8</ref> To the extent that the consumers exercise these choices they put competitive pressure on online advertisers to account for the value that consumers place on data about themselves. Consumers can also avoid websites and web services that scan and store personal content. For example, some users may avoid Google Gmail because it scans and records the content of emails while others may value the targeted ads that result from Google's ability to examine the content of the emails.</p>

Journal citation counts in Google Scholar substantially outnumber those in WoS and Scopus <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref> and constitute important indicators for small journals from non-Anglophone countries, where a large proportion of citations come from local and non-English journals, PhD theses, and books <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>.

            <p>We surveyed the literature in three steps. The sample was constructed between December 2010 and November 2011. First, the Google Scholar and EconLIT search engines were used, searching for the key phrases "labor supply child care elasticity" and "labor force participation and child care prices" as well as variations of these key phrases that replace "labor supply" with "employment" and child care with "child care" throughout the construction period. The second source of literature was the reference lists of the articles found in the initial search. Third, the literature review of <ref type="bibr">Blau and Currie (2006)</ref> and the literature review of <ref type="bibr">Wrohlich (2006)</ref> were extensively used, the former for mostly studies from the United States and Canada, and the latter for studies from Europe.

            <p>According to Google Scholar, <ref type="bibr">Jensen (2003)</ref> is the most cited empirical study on the relationship between FDI and democracy. It has been cited 650 times, and, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, it remains a key reference today. In this section, we investigate the robustness of this study's findings to outliers. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The sample covers 112 countries over the period 1970-1997, the dependent variable is FDI inflows as a share of GDP, and the proxy for democracy is Polity IV score (see Table <ref type="table">5</ref> for a description). We focus on the key regression of the paper: model 10 in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. The estimates suggest that a fully autocratic government (score of 0) becoming fully democratic (score of 20) can be expected to attract 0.4% more FDI flows as a percentage of GDP). Given that the average level of FDI flows in the sample is 1.3% of GDP, this is a sizeable amount.</p>

Cases were divided into facial surgeries and body surgeries and were further subdivided into additional categories. Each case was then analyzed to determine the number of individuals that were accused and the institution where the surgery had been performed. Additionally, the associated complications, monetary amounts, and reasons for judgments against plastic surgeons were analyzed. The cases were further evaluated with respect to care standards to determine whether a breach of care standards had occurred.</p>

            <p>Third, the Bank's size and the pressures on each unit to stay big also foster knowledge products that are essentially "make-work" schemes that make little or no contribution to knowledge and so have attracted little attention. Using the very broad citation data that can be assembled from Google Scholar, 2 in <ref type="bibr">Ravallion and Wagstaff (2012)</ref>, my coauthor and I find that it is hard to discern more than a negligible impact for many Bank publications, though certainly not all.</p>

            <p>The HPLC-MS/MS analysis was carried out using an Agi-lent Technologies 1200 series HPLC (Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled to a Waters Quattro Micro TM atmospheric pressure ionization (API) mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI interface. A Brownlee SPP C18 column (2.1 mm&#215;75 mm i.d., 2.7 mm) was used, and the mobile phase was 5% acetonitrile in H2O acidified with 0.1% acetic acid run at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The KJ was dissolved in 5% acetonitrile to a final concentration of 30 mg/mL, filtered using a 0.45-mm PVDF filter, and then injected at a volume of 30 mL. The operating parameters of the mass spectrometer were as follows. In the negative ion mode, source and desolvation temperatures were 120 and 350&#176;C, respectively; capillary voltage was 3000 V; cone voltage was 47 V; and collision energy was 30, 50 V. Nitrogen gas was used as the nebulizing and desolvation agents with flow rates of 50 and 350 L/h, respectively. The mass scan was set from m/z 100-800. The MS/MS acquisition was scanned at the same mass range to detect the daughter ions and the MassLynx software version 4.1 was used to operate the MS instruments.</p>

            <p>Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>. A model for FAK in invadopodia regulation. FAK and its phosphorylation at Tyr-397 recruit a pool of active Src to mediate localized tyrosine phosphorylation of substrates at focal adhesions. A balance between tyrosine phosphorylation at focal adhesions and invadopodia is required for proper dynamics and cell migration. Depletion of FAK releases active Src to mediate enhanced phosphorylation of substrates at invadopodia, which impairs focal adhesion dynamics but enhances the formation and dynamics of invadopodia; however, this is not sufficient for effective invasion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Artym et al., 2006)</ref> and subsequently coating with 10 &#181;g/ml fibronectin for 1 h at 37&#176;C. Matrigel (BD) coverslips were prepared by coating a thin layer of a 1:10 dilution of Matrigel for 1 h at 37&#176;C. Cells were cultured on coverslips for 16 h, fixed, and stained with antibodies. Coverslips were imaged using a 60&#215;/1.40 oil objective on an inverted microscope (1X-70; Olympus) equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (CoolSNAP FX; Photometrics) or an inverted microscope (TE300; Nikon) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (Orca II; Hamamatsu Photonics). Images were captured into MetaVue (version 6.2; MDS Analytical Technologies) or MetaMorph imaging software (version 7.1; MDS Analytical Technologies). At least 40 cells were counted in each of at least three separate experiments performed on separate days. Dotlike structures containing cortactin and/or actin were scored as invadopodia. For ratiometric analysis, images were first subjected to high-pass filtration based on the water algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Zamir et al., 1999)</ref> to remove diffuse background fluorescence. The images were thresholded based on the vinculin image because it had the largest signal to noise ratio, providing the clearest distinction between focal adhesions and background. The thresholded vinculin image was used to generate a binary image in which values at focal adhesions equal 1 and all other values equal 0. A ratio image of vinculin/pY416 Src was generated, and high frequency noise was removed with a low-pass filter. Ratio images were displayed with similar nucleocytoplasmic background as a control for possible differences in staining. Ratiometric images presented are representative of at least 50 cells visualized by immunofluorescence.</p>
            <p>Glass coverslips were acid washed, ethanol sterilized, and coated with ECM as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cortesio et al., 2008)</ref>. Fibronectin coverslips were prepared by coating with 10 &#181;g/ml fibronectin for 1 h at 37&#176;C. Fibronectin-gelatin (10 &#181;g/ml fibronectin and 0.2% gelatin) coverslips were prepared by coating gelatin coverslips as described previously software (FV10-ASW version 01.07; Olympus). 3D projections (x-z shown) were generated from 3.0-4.0-&#181;m z series to illustrate invadopodial projections into fluorescent gelatin matrix. For FAK localization, single projections were generated from 3.0-4.0-&#181;m z series with a 0.37-&#181;m step size. Images were subsequently processed using MetaMorph software.</p>

            <p>The primary analysis for the primary as well as secondary outcome measures was carried out by treatment allocated. Positive change scores indicate a benefit to parenting or well-being. A per protocol analysis compared outcomes for families in which parents did not attend an FLNP session to outcomes for families in which parents attended six or more FLNP sessions. For both treatment allocated and per protocol analysis, we report complete cases analysis results for all outcomes. In all analyses, we fitted multilevel models with a random effects term for course and for outcomes corresponding to individual child data and a random effects term for family. For the families in the control, the betweenfamily variance was assumed to be equal to that between families in the intervention group attending different courses; terms in the model were thus included as if each control family formed their own course, so that they contributed to estimating the between course random effect variance. For sensitivity analysis, we performed multiple imputation using predictive mean matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">70</ref> and results are reported for the primary  For each outcome, we created 10 imputed datasets using the Hmisc package in the R statistical programme and combined the analysis results from the 10 imputed datasets using Rubin rules. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">70</ref> </p>

Before imaging, live nuclei were stained with HOECHST-33342 at 100 ng ml &#192; 1 . All experiments were performed in triplicate and at least three times. Error bars show s.d. from one representative experiment.</p>

            <p>Protein was isolated and quantified from a tissue punch taken from the right and left putamen from each monkey.The amount of Huntingtin protein per lane was quantified by densitometry using the 'Gels' macro provided by the National Institutes of Health ImageJ software (version 1.42q) following the method described in the user manual <ref type="bibr">(Ferreira and Rasband, 2011)</ref>. Briefly, the background was digitally subtracted from the image using the macro provided, and then the lanes were manually designated with identically sized rectangles adequate to fully enclose the Huntingtin band in each lane. The 1D lane profile plots were generated by the software (representing the density of the image summed over horizontal raster lines of each rectangle), then the area under each lane's plot at the peak corresponding to the Huntingtin band was computed. These values were normalized by dividing by the value for the density of the tubulin band in the same lane obtained by the same method.</p>

This is because the amount of active RSK1 is only a fraction of the total RSK1 and its translocation to the nucleus creates a higher concentration in the nucleus than the larger cytoplasmic compartment. Because of this concentration difference, it is difficult to clearly see the cytoplasmic active RSK1 by immunocytochemistry with anti-phospho-T573 antibody. However, by cell fractionation (see Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>C later in this paper) and ImageJ analyses (see Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> later in this paper), active endogenous RSK1 is detectable in the cytoplasm.</p>

            <p>We have previously described the presence of CTB-EVs in our MSC EV preparation. These EVs were shown by pulse-chase experiments to be derived from endosomes and were therefore bona fide exosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. In addition, CTB could be used to extract endosome-derived MSC EVs from an MSC-conditioned medium. These CTB-EVs carried exosome-associated proteins and had a flotation density of 1.09&#193;1.17 g/mL. In our extraction protocol, CTB effectively extracts at least 96% of CD81 in the conditioned medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Here, we determine the proteome of these CTB-EVs and CTB-EV depleted MSC EV preparation by mass spectrometry as previously described (10). 1,806 proteins were detected in the CTB-bound fraction and 1,547 were present in the CTB-depleted fraction (Supplementary File 1). 987 proteins were found in both fractions, suggesting that these 987 proteins are likely proteins commonly found in most EVs. The observation that 819 and 560 proteins were detected only in either CTB-bound or -depleted fraction respectively indicated that CTB-EVs represent a distinct class of EVs and that there were possibly other EV types beside the CTB-bound EVs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). The proteins in the CTB-bound fraction and CTB-depleted fraction were functionally clustered into biological process, molecular functions and pathways by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis platform (Ingenuity Systems, Mountain View, CA). From the analysis of the CTB-bound fraction and CTB-depleted fraction, we respectively selected a set of 20 pathways that had the least likelihood of the clustered proteins being associated with a pathway due to random chance, that is, the lowest p value. There were many shared pathways in these 2 sets. There were also pathways that were unique to either the CTB-bound or depleted fractions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</p>
            <p>The MSC EV preparation described above was extracted with CTB to isolate the CTB-binding EVs as described below. The remaining EV preparation after CTB extraction was collected as CTB-depleted MSC EV. Proteins (250 mg) from each of the 2 fractions were analysed by LC-MS/MS. Briefly, the samples were reduced by DTT, alkylated with IAA, digested by trypsin and analysed with LC-MS/MS as described <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. For each sample, all MS/MS spectra of each of the 3 independent preparations were extracted by ProteomeDiscovere 1.4 (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) and combined into a single mascot generic file by a hand-written program. Protein identification was achieved by searching the combined data against the Uniprot human protein database (download 22 Jan 2014; 88479 sequences, 35079223 residues) via an in-house Mascot server (Version 2.4.1Matrix Science, UK). The search parameters were a maximum of 2 missed cleavages using trypsin; fixed modification was carbamidomethylation of cysteine, and variable modifications were oxidation of methionine and deamidation of asparagine and glutamine. The mass tolerances were set to 10 ppm and 0.8 Da for peptide precursor and fragment ions, respectively. Protein identification was accepted as true positive if 2 different peptides were found to have scores greater than the homology or identity scores.</p>

            <p>Vendors of standards have been known to use this to their advantage: Microsoft's breakthrough famously came with agreements to couple their software with IBM hardware. Another well-known case linked to the company is the bundling of its operating system Windows with its web browser Internet Explorer. Today, many large companies in the ICT (information and communication technology) sector maintain extensive portfolios of partly bundled or integrated products. While the phenomenon is by no means limited to the ICT sector, the strength of network externalities in ICT makes examples in this sector both more numerous and more obvious. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Obvious strategies to gain an advantage for a competing standard in such a setting include increasing the compatibility with major competitors in other segments, <ref type="bibr">3</ref> introducing spin-off standards in other segments, and reducing compatibility with weaker competitor's products in order to drive them out of business.</p>

Binding reactions took place in a solution containing 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.05% (v/v) NP-40 and 5 mM MgCl 2 in final concentration, as well as one type of double-stranded, fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide as template (rDNA En: 5 0 -TCT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTC TTT TTT CCT CC, Cy5-labeled; GC ctrl: 5 0 -CAC GCG CTC GCG CAC GCG CTC GCG CAC GCG CTC, Cy3-labeled) with a constant concentration of 50 nM. For each binding analysis, a titration series was prepared with varying concentrations of the respective peptide as indicated in the plots. All curves were plotted with the KaleidaGraph software, and the thermophoresis signals were fitted with the Hill equation corrected for the minimum (Min) and maximum (Max) values of the binding curve: Y(c) = Min+(Max &#192; Min)/(1+EC 50 / c 0 pep ) n , with Y (c) being the thermophoresis signal, c 0 pep the variable concentration of the respective peptide, EC 50 the concentration where half of the oligonucleotide is bound and n being the Hill-coefficient. Thermophoresis signals were normalized to fraction bound (X) by X = [Y(c) &#192; Min]/(Max &#192; Min), error bars (std) were normalized by std norm = std(c)/(Max &#192; Min), and both were plotted and fitted as described earlier in the text.

            <p>Ocular motor simulations of the effects of acetazolamide on INS were performed in the MATLAB Simulink (The MathWorks, Natick, MA) environment. The most recent version of our behavioral ocular motor system (OMS) model (version 1.4) is also available from http://www.omlab.org. Details of the model can be found elsewhere <ref type="bibr">[15, 17, 20, 23]</ref>. To simulate the subject's data, the NAFX peak was set to -2&#176; and the breadth of the NAFX vs Gaze Angle curve was set to be moderate and symmetrical. To simulate the effects of acetazolamide, it was hypothesized to act centrally by reducing the oscillation, originating in the damping control of smooth pursuit, which underlies most INS waveforms.</p>

            <p>TAP-tagged samples were eluted from IgG Sepharose with TEV cleavage and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Two experimental and two control samples (mock purification from a Tetrahymena cell line not expressing TAP-Pot1a) were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and visualized by colloidal Coomassie. The entire lane was excised, divided into 16 pieces, and prepared for MS analysis by in-gel reduction, alkylation, and trypsin digestion. The eluted samples were then analyzed by reverse-phase nano-electrospray tandem MS as described previously <ref type="bibr">(Mead et al., 2010)</ref>. The MS/MS spectra emanating from the gel slices for each lane were concatenated and searched against tryptic peptides predicted from the Tetrahymena genome (TTA1_08302006.pep; ftp://ftp.ciliate.org/Tetrahymena/sequence/) using the X!Tandem (www.thegpm.org/TANDEM) and Mascot (Matrix Science, Boston, MA) search engines.

To assess whether relationships based on perceptions differed from those based on objective data, we ran a survey using Amazon Mechanical Turk (https://www.mturk.com) to explore attitudes towards blood donations across 78 high-and low-income countries. The survey and overview of the results are available with the online appendix. The results show that, similar to the objective data, controlling for a country's income, respondents from volunteer collection countries are more likely to believe their country is collecting blood effi ciently and distributing it fairly (p &lt; .05). However, respondent's perceptions of the safety to either the donor or recipient do not vary with the percent of blood collected from volunteers (p &gt; .85).

            <p>Mfold analysis predicted the same optimal topology for sxy-1-5 mRNAs as for wild-type mRNAs, but the sxy-1-5 structures were not as thermodynamically stable and were predicted to have higher frequencies of single strandedness throughout. Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>A plots the stability of Stem 1 in hypercompetent mutants, calculated by Mfold, showing that each point mutation is predicted to reduce the stability of Stem 1. In addition, this analysis predicts that Stem 1 will be the most important contributor to the overall stability of themRNA secondary structure, and thus may help explain why all five hypercompetence mutations were found in this region. Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>B presents the analysis of single-strandedness across multiple thermodynamically stable folding predictions for the bases in Stem 1. The sxy point mutations are predicted to cause 2-to 3-fold increases in single-strandedness.</p>
            <p>The clustering of the mutations into two regions suggested that mRNA secondary structure might play a role in regulation. Examination of sxy mRNA for possible base pairing between these regions revealed a long stretch of potential base pairing between positions 9-26 of the UTR and positions 94-111 of the coding region, with only a single 2 &#194; 2 bubble. All five hypercompetence mutations fall within this predicted stem. Moreover, each of the mutations eliminates a base pair within this stem, so that each is expected to destabilize the secondary structure. Analysis of this region with the RNA-folding program Mfold supported this folding model, and also predicted pairing between segments internal to this stem, creating two additional stems and three loops, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>A.</p>

            <p>As a web-based system, pseudoMap can thoroughly identify TPGs, including TPGs act as a miRNA regulators and TPGs-derived eSTIs in humans. There are two ways to access pseudoMap: by browsing the database content or by searching for a particular TPG. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>A displays theIt displays the more fine-grained information of (E) esiRNA-target interaction and (F) RNA folding structure of TPG-derived esiRNA. In addition, pseudoMap also incorporates the external sources, such as (G) UCSC genome browser for a genomic view, GeneCards for gene annotation and miRBase for miRNA annotation.</p>
            <p>A computational pipeline was developed to verify the hypotheses that human TPGs may generate esiRNAs to regulate protein-coding genes (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). An attempt was made to identify the candidates of TPG-derived esiRNAs, by aligning the sequences of TPGs and fsRNAs. These candidates were verified using the deep sequencing data from various sRNA libraries <ref type="bibr">(35-38)</ref> experimented with on human embryo stem cells, liver tissues or HCC tissues. The hairpin structure by Mfold <ref type="bibr">(40)</ref> was then determined by using the extended sequences of these candidates of esiRNAs. In pseudoMap, a total of 1232 TPGs may produce esiRNAs, which were profiling by deep sequencing data, within 1404 human TPGs were characterized. The information of these TPGs is shown in Supplementary File 1. The results showed that 4 miRNAs and 326 piRNAs may derive from TPGs. We also found that miRNA has-miR-622 was identified, which was derived from keratin 18 pseudogene 27, located on nt 858-879, as similar as miRBase database. Table <ref type="table">2</ref> summarizes the entire statistical analysis of pseudoMap.</p>
            <p>Our previous approach (41) was modified to identify TPG-derived esiRNA targets. Briefly, the esiRNA targetsites within the conserved regions of coding, 5'-UTR and 3'-UTR of genes were identified in 12 metazoan genomes by using three computational approaches, TargetScan <ref type="bibr">(42- 44)</ref>, miRanda <ref type="bibr">(45)</ref> and RNAhybrid <ref type="bibr">(46)</ref>. The minima free energy (MFE) threshold was &#192;20 kcal/mol with a score more than or equal to 150 for miRanda and default parameters for TargetScan and RNAhybrid. The targets were identified using the following criteria: (i) the potential target sites were determined by at least two approaches; (ii) multiple target sites were prioritized and (iii) target sites must be located in accessible regions. Finally, we provided the gene expression profiles of TPG and its cognate gene to construct the eSTIs.</p>
            <p>The system flow of pseudoMap is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, mainly including the collection of datasets such as TPGs, parental</p>
            <p>To demonstrate that in human, as in animal models, TPGs may generate naturally occurring siRNAs and Piwi interacting RNAs (piRNAs) to regulate the expression of protein-coding genes, we have developed a computational pipeline and constructed a database-pseudoMap, the map for studying pseudogenes. pseudoMap pre-processes the raw data of public microarray and deep sequencing data into gene expression profiles for both TPG and its cognate gene and small RNA (sRNA) profiles for TPG-derived esiRNAs. pseudoMap further combined the gene expression profiles to construct the TPG-derived esiRNA-target interactions (eSTIs). In addition, according to the previous study of pseudogene, PTENP1 exerts a miRNA decoy by binding to cognate-targeting miRNAs <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref>, and pseudoMap also provided the 'miRNA regulator' to elucidate the relationship of TPG and its cognate gene with miRNA target regulation.</p>

            <p>Over a period of 4 years leading up to Mobyle's first release, a series of about 30 user interviews and participatory design workshops involving brainstorming sessions and video prototyping were conducted. These were used to gain a deeper understanding of how a web portal could facilitate the use of bioinformatics tools by biologists. These studies are described in detail elsewhere <ref type="bibr">(Letondal and Amanatian, 2004)</ref>. The results showed the principal needs of biologists to be: (1) a stable and predictable set of known tools integrated in a portal designed for inexperienced users; (2) an overview of the analyses and careful organization of results; (3) reusability features to re-execute previous commands; and (4) userdefined and ready-to-use analysis pipelines, similar to benchmarked protocols. We also concluded that caution should be taken regarding advanced features. Indeed, (5) biologists are often sceptical about sophisticated tools that are difficult to understand: they have to be able to anticipate the benefits that such tools may provide.</p>

All the other family data, such as multiple sequence alignments are stored in a local MySQL database. As well as the relational data model, wikis also do not lend themselves to storing data entities such as alignments, structures and probabilistic models. Most databases have extensive quality control procedures, which do not fit the simple edit and save model of the wiki. Consequently, other mechanisms are required to add new entries to the database [for an example from Pfam, see ref. <ref type="bibr">(7)</ref>], but wikis, in whatever form, provide an excellent platform for storing free text annotations that are editable by a distributed user community.</p>

            <p>Step 1: The interval s is sampled using [ s / d steps. In every step i, the sign of the derivative of errneo at xi, namely s i , is calculated. If si is positive and si-1 is negative, a zero crossing that belongs to a minimum occurs between xi-1 and xi. This interval is added to a vector of candidates. This first sampling step is only required for small k when one cannot assume that there is only a single minimum. Other methods to find multiple minima could be used here, but this method has the advantage to use a definedFig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> The pseudo-code for the implementation of the NeONORM algorithm.

After RNA-seq reads were mapped to the respective genome, the antisense strands of all protein coding genes were scanned using a custom Perl script to identify regions with a read depth of at least 200.

            <p>Along with potential TSPs for antisense transcription our screen revealed a large number of intragenic promoters with sense orientation and preferred location near the initiating codon. Though expediency of alternative transcription remains vague, very similar phenomenon has been recently registered in eukaryotic genomes [see, e.g. ref. <ref type="bibr">(40)</ref>]. In the chromosome of E. coli, there are several pairs of extensively overlapping genes encoding two proteins or a protein and an untranslated RNA. Many of them may be transcribed from common promoters. However genes hokC, tpr and ygeN with 5 0 -ends mapped within mokC, rttR and ygeO, respectively, as well as 46 transcripts partly matching sense strand and detected in the fraction of short RNAs by Vogel et al. <ref type="bibr">(31)</ref> may be also initiated from their own promoters predicted by PlatProm. Internal promoters with sense orientation may, thus, mark candidates for alternative transcription.</p>

            <p>Chemicals and plasmids. Insulin and rapamycin were from Sigma and Tauto Biotech (Shanghai, China), respectively. The vector p-CAGGS-DN-AMPK-IRES-EGFP encoding dominant-negative AMPK protein was a gift from Dr. Jia Li, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, China. The HA-tagged constitutively active S6K1 expression plasmid was the Addgene plasmid 8991, originally from John Blenis's laboratory. Effectene Transfection Reagent was from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Animals and treatment. Male C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Shanghai Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). GCN2 knockout (Gcn2 2/2 ) and leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mice were provided by Dr. Douglas Cavener, Penn State University, and Dr. Xiang Gao, Nanjing University, China, respectively. Eight-to ten-week-old mice were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle at 25&#176;C. Control (nutritionally complete amino acid) and (2) leu diets were obtained from Research Diets, Inc. (New Brunswick, NJ). All diets were isocaloric and compositionally the same in terms of carbohydrate and lipid component. At the start of the feeding experiments, mice were acclimated to a control diet for 7 days and then randomly divided into control and (2) leu diet groups, with free access to control and (2) leu diets, respectively, for 7 days. In addition, a pair-fed group was included to distinguish the possible influence of the minor reduction in food intake, as previously observed in the (2) leu group <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. A subset of mice underwent glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) and insulin tolerance tests (ITTs) before they were killed by CO 2 inhalation. These experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute for Nutritional Sciences, Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Cell culture and treatments. HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 25 mmol/L glucose (Gibco, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 10% FBS, 50 mg/mL penicillin and streptomycin at 37&#176;C, and 5% CO 2 -95% air. Control and (2) leu medium were prepared from amino acid-free DMEM (Invitrogen) by adding back all the amino acids contained in regular DMEM and without leucine only, respectively. For the rapamycin treatment, cells were incubated with 50 nmol/L rapamycin for 1 h. To induce insulin resistance, HepG2 cells were incubated with 18 mmol/L glucosamine for 18 h in serum-free medium as previously described ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>), followed by incubation in serum-free (2) leu or control medium for 24 h in the presence of glucosamine. The GCN2-knockdown (KO) stable cell lines were obtained by transfecting pSilencer4.1-CMV-puro-GCN2 small interfering (si)RNA vector into HepG2 cells and selecting for stable clones in the presence of 0.5 mg/mL puromycin. Isolation of primary hepatocytes. Male C57BL/6J mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with chloral hydrate. Hepatocytes were prepared by collagenase perfusion as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. Isolated hepatocytes were resuspended in 10% FBS DMEM and incubated for 1 day before switching to (2) leu medium. Generation and administration of recombinant adenoviruses. The recombinant adenoviruses used for the S6K1 expression were generated using AdEasy Vector System (Qbiogene, Montreal, Canada). Briefly, S6K1 gene was cloned into a transfer vector. The resulting plasmid was then linearized with PmeI and cotransformed into Escherichia coli strain BJ5183 together with pAdEasy-1. After transformation in DH5a for greater yields of DNA production, the recombinant adenoviral construct was cleaved with PacI and transfected into QBI-293A cells to produce viral particles. Adenoviruses were purified by ultracentrifugation in cesium chloride gradient and quantified. Viruses were diluted in PBS and administered via tail vein injection, using 5 3 10 8 pfu/mice. Blood glucose, serum insulin, GTT, ITT, and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index. Blood glucose levels were measured using a Glucometer Elite monitor. Serum insulin levels were measured using the Mercodia Ultrasensitive Rat Insulin ELISA kit (ALPCO Diagnostic, Salem, NH). GTTs and ITTs were performed by i.p. injection of 2 g/kg glucose after overnight fasting and 0.75 units/kg insulin after 4-h fasting, respectively. Homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index was calculated according to the formula: [fasting glucose levels (mmol/L)] 3 [fasting serum insulin (mU/mL)]/22.5. Glycogen synthesis assay. HepG2 cells were incubated in (2) leu medium for the indicated times before adding 100 nmol/L insulin and 1 mCi/mL [ 3 H] glucose. Cells were incubated with control or (2) leu medium for 3 h before harvesting for glycogen synthesis assays, as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. In vivo insulin signaling assay. Mice maintained on different diets were fasted for 6 h before insulin injection as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. Sections of liver, soleus muscle, and abdominal fat were excised from anesthetized mice and snap-frozen, as untreated controls. Three to five minutes after injection with 2 units/kg of insulin via the portal vein, pieces of tissue section were excised and snap-frozen for Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis. Whole-cell lysates were isolated using RIPA lysis buffer (150 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 50 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% Tween 20). Protease and phosphatase inhibitors were added to all buffers before experiments. Western blot analysis was performed as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.

First, these classes of estimators are typically nonlinear, so commonly data analytics. First, these classes of estimators are typically nonlinear, so commonly known nonlinear relationships-such as the curvilinear relationship between age known nonlinear relationships-such as the curvilinear relationship between age and turnout (older cohorts vote at higher rates than younger cohorts but this and turnout (older cohorts vote at higher rates than younger cohorts but this relationship peaks among group 60-70 years old and then reverses)-are easily relationship peaks among group 60-70 years old and then reverses)-are easily accommodated by the algorithms. Second, the approach involves less discretion accommodated by the algorithms. Second, the approach involves less discretion for the individual campaign data analyst, so the quality of the predictive scores for the individual campaign data analyst, so the quality of the predictive scores generated is not as heavily dependent on the capabilities and integrity of analysts. generated is not as heavily dependent on the capabilities and integrity of analysts.

Membranes were soaked in scintillation cocktail solution (4 ml) after drying at 60 C for 1 h and then the amount of bound RNA was measured using liquid scintillation counter. The membrane after filtering and washing steps with only probe was determined and used as the base line (0%), and the membrane after just spotting of probe without washing was determined and used as 100% binding.

            <p>Risk factors were defined according to the World Health Organization definition of risk groups <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. A risk group for TB is any group of people within which the prevalence or incidence of TB is significantly higher than in the general population. The following risk factors were examined: age, gender, HIV, diabetes, smoking, high-risk job (e.g., health-care worker), cavitations on chest X-ray, extrapulmonary TB, previously treatment for TB. The last variable (previous treatment) was treated as a binary (yes or no), and the "yes" patients were labeled as "received prior treatment" <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. Data analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics version 19.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptors and risk factors were compared using the independent samples t-test. Logistic regression was performed to compare M/XDR-TB cases to susceptible TB cases, and categorical variables were compared using the c 2 test, with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). A p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.</p>

            <p>Baseline demographic, clinical and contextual measures of the 46 patients and 11 HCPs were obtained by a selfadministered questionnaire, including the dyadic PFC. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">51</ref> Descriptive analyses were used to describe the characteristics of the patients and HCPs, to calculate the mean PFC score per possible confounder, and to provide insight into the percentage of patients and HCPs who were fully satisfied with the consultation. Questions with a score of ,90% full satisfaction were used in extra analyses. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to find any covariates that might explain the variance in PFC scores for the patients and HCPs. Dummies were created for employment status. All covariates were recoded into 2 classes, for example age ,70 years and age $70 years. The mean score on the PFC questionnaire was only calculated if a patient or HCP had answered 10 or more questions out of the 16. All data were analyzed in SPSS version 19.</p>

            <p>Previous work has demonstrated that the PER2 S662G and PER2 S662D mutations give rise to completely contrary circadian phenotypes in terms of circadian period, phase and amplitude; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> thus, we predicted Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> The relative phases of cell cycle genes are shifted by PER2 mutations. Wild-type and different PER2 mutant MEFs were synchronized by a dexamethasone treatment, and RNA was extracted at 3 h intervals stating 10 h after the shock. p21, Cyclin D1 and Nr1d1 expression analysis were done by q-PCR. Experiments were repeated independently at least three times with consistent results. Plotted values are the mean values &#177; S.D. Cosinor analysis was performed on mRNA profiles using SPSS 17.0. The amplitude and acrophase obtained from cosinor analysis were further analyzed by Students t-test. The null hypothesis was rejected at Po0.05 that the PER2 S662G and PER2 S662D mutant mice should have contrary cancer risks if impaired rhythm is the culprit. However, the enhanced cancer risk in both PER2 S662G2H :p53 R172H/ &#254; and PER2 S662D2H :p53 R172H/ &#254; mice strongly suggested that the impaired PER2 gene, not the impaired circadian rhythm, is responsible for the increased cancer risk in these mice. This observation is further supported by survival data from the PER2 S662D2H :p53 R172H/ &#254; and Clock D19/ &#254; :p53 R172H/ &#254; mice, both of which exhibited lengthened circadian periods, but showed highly contrary cancer risks. Interestingly, the 'impaired gene' theory is consistent with the observation from cancer risks in Cry1 &#192;/&#192; :Cry2 &#192;/&#192; mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> and Clock D19 mutant mice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> In addition, we wish to point out that our experiments share an important similarity with the abovementioned investigations; all of these experimental systems retain the circadian mutant mice on normal light/dark cycles and subject these mice to entrainment from external time cues. Accordingly, the 'impaired gene' theory may only apply to circadian mutant mice kept in normal light/dark cycles. Circadian disruption is not as intense or detrimental in normal cycles as the disruption experienced by shift workers. In this regard, an important future direction may focus on both the respective contribution and the composite consequence of disrupted circadian genes, as well as disrupted circadian rhythm to cancer risk in persistent phase-shifted schedules.</p>
            <p>Statistical analysis. Groups of data are presented as mean &#177; S.D. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's test or Students t-test was used to determine the statistical significance of difference in measured parameters. Difference was considered significant at Po0.05. Cosinor analysis was performed on mRNA profiles using SPSS 17.0. The amplitude and acrophase obtained from cosinor analysis were further analyzed by Students t-test. The null hypothesis was rejected at Po0.05.</p>

            <p>Stanford ERAS protocol is a three-phase multimodal care pathway that includes pre-, intra-and post-operative steps, supported by published data <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> The protocol includes preoperative education, no bowel prep, 24 hour perioperative antibiotics with cefoxitin begun within 1 hour of incision, epidural postop analgesia with minimization of narcotics, careful fluid management, no nasogastric tube and early feeding. Alvimopan, a gastrointestinal opioid receptor antagonist, was introduced in the protocol in July 2013 and was used in the last 101 patients. Patients did not routinely go to the ICU and home intravenous hydration was not used. We excluded from the analysis 4 patients who remained intubated post-operatively and could not be started on oral feeding. Results were compared with a pre-ERAS consecutive series of 177 RC patients from the three years prior to institution of the ERAS protocol, January 2009 to December 2011. Data were analyzed with SPSS &#174; , version 19.0. A logistic regression model was performed to identify independent variables associated with readmission. The Institutional Review Board waived requirement of a separate informed consent for this study.</p>

Descriptive statistics, including mean and SD were calculated for continuous variables. The dependent variables were established cardiovascular risk factors, including lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, blood pressure, and CRP. One-way ANOVA was done to compare the mean of mentioned variables among different categorization of body fat composition. The relationships between body composition, anthropometric variables and risk factors were assessed using correlation coefficient. For HDL-c and FBS, non-parametric test was done. In order to evaluate the independence of correlates of risk factor variables, after adjusting for age and socioeconomic status of family, linear regression analysis was used, except for CRP, response of which was observed by exponential regression. Statistical significance level was considered as P less than 0.05.</p>

            <p>The TLICS consists of three variables: 1) the morphology of the fracture pattern as assessed by radiological tests, 2) whether injury in the posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) is involved or not, and 3) the neurologic status of the patient (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). After scoring each variable, the treatment plans are determined according to the sum (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). When scoring the variables of the TLICS, the morphology of injury, based on the radiology of the thoracolumbar injury, was classified as 3 types: 1) the compression type, 2) the translocation/rotation type and 3) the distraction type, and they were each scored as 1, 3 and 4 points, respectively. Additionally, concerning the presence of a burst fracture with the compression injuries, 1 point was added and thus it was scored as 2 points. For cases with multiple injuries of an identical type, no more than one injury was added to be scored. For cases with the combination of multiple different 110 / ASJ: Vol. 4, No. 2, 2010  types of injuries, only one injury type with the highest points was scored. Regarding the score of the injury in the posterior ligamentous complex, the cases with no other injury were 0 points, the cases with unclear injury were 2 points and the cases with apparent injury were scored as 3 points. As for the score of the neurologic status, the cases without neurological symptoms on the neurologic examination were 0 points, the cases with injury at the nerve root were 2 points and the cases with complete or incomplete neurological injury in the spinal cord and the conus medullaris were 2 points and 3 points, respectively. The cases with injury in the cauda equine were scored as 3 points (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 and 2</ref>). Afterward, the intrarater reliability, as well as the interrater reliability of the score for each variable and sum, were evaluated by Cohen's unweighted k-value and Spearman' s rank order correlation. For the statistical distinction of the Kappa values, the distinction according to the guideline of Viera and Garrett <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> was applied (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). In addition, the sensitivity and specificity were evaluated by the percent of correct treatment protocols according to the sum of the TLICS and the treatment actually performed on the patients. The validity of selecting treatment protocols according to this classification was also assessed. SPSS ver. 13.0 (SPSS Reliability and Validity of TLICS / 111 Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.

            <p>Background: Incidence of asthma in adolescents leads to variations in family status, roles and interaction with peers for them, which could be a source of stress and psychological tensions in them. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the effect of Orem's self-care model on perceived stress in adolescents with asthma. Methods: In this semi-experimental study conducted from April 2013 to February 2014, 64 asthmatic adolescents referring Shariati Hospital, Isfahan were enrolled by simple random sampling and the patients were assigned to two groups of control and intervention. Then, Orem's self-care model-based training was implemented throughout eight sessions of two hours each and the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale was administered to both groups prior to and two months after the completion of the training. The data were analyzed by descriptive and analytical statistics consisting of paired t-test, independent t-test, Chi-square and Mann-Whitney using SPSS Version 20. Results: Mean age of the participants was 14.15&#177;3.12 years in the intervention group and 15.21&#177;3.09 years in the control groups. 68.8% and 59.4% of the participants were male in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Independent t-test indicated a significant difference in the mean scores of perceived stress in the intervention (25.46&#177;5.31) and control groups (28.90&#177;5.27) after the training. Also, the result of paired t-test indicated a significant difference in the mean score of perceived stress between before (29.18&#177;5.27) and after (25.46&#177;5.31) training.</p>

            <p>The SGRQ total score is a continuous variable, and was positively skewed with many zeros. Thus, the two-part model was developed, which takes advantage of the basic rule of probability and splits into two parts-frequency (ie, any worse respiratory health status and the estimate included all the participants) and severity (ie, amount of worse respiratory health status and the estimate was based on a subsample of participants with respiratory health status greater than zero). <ref type="bibr">19 20</ref> The two-part model used logit regression in the first part, and generalised linear model regression with the log link and &#947; distribution in the second part. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> Both the unadjusted and adjusted (to determine independent predictors of the score) models were developed, which also included a sample with unknown values for the variables (from section I). All the section I variables were included in the adjusted model. Coefficients and their respective 95% CI were calculated. The results were considered significant when p values were less than or equal to 0.05. All data were analysed using STATAV.12 for Windows software. <ref type="bibr">21</ref>

The evaluation of distribution differences of selected variables and alleles of the TERT rs2736100 and rs2736098 between CHB patients and healthy controls were done using &#967; 2 test. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium of the genotype distribution among the controls was tested by a goodness-of-fit &#967; 2 test. Unconditional univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to estimate ORs for risk of CHB or LC and their 95% CIs. The LTL difference between patients and healthy controls was assessed using the Mann-Whitney U-tests. All the tests were computed using SigmaStat3.1 software (Systat Software, Inc., Richmond, CA, USA). For comparison of rs2736098 and rs2736100 genotypes between healthy controls and CHB patients, P values were adjusted by Bonferroni correction and a statistical significance should be o0.025. P values of o0.05 were considered as statistically significant for all other comparisons. <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p>

            <p>Although articles appearing in the journal are normally solicited by the editors and associate editors, a number of unsolicited proposals and papers arrive directly at the journal's administrative office. The journal charges no submission fee and thus attracts a wide range of proposals. Most submissions are inappropriate for the journal for one reason or another, often including level of specialization, style of exposition, or narrowness of focus. Others are good ideas that overlap to some extent with plans that have already been made. Still other suggestions offer possibilities and spark a discussion between the editors, the associate editors, and the author that sometimes leads to a JEP article. The journal typically receives roughly 200 unsolicited proposals each year. While the journal remains open to ideas and input from all sources, it remains the case that the overwhelming proportion of articles appearing in the journal are solicited by the editors and associate editors. During the past year, the journal has moved to electronic distribution of galley proofs and all materials, as well as using Skype for international calls when possible.</p>

Clearly, if the study is free of hidden bias, &#947; will be zero and the participation probability will solely be determined by x i . However, if there is hidden bias, two individuals with the same observed covariates x have differing chances of receiving treatment. Varying the value of &#947; allows the researcher to assess the sensitivity of the results with respect to 'hidden bias'. Based on that, bounds for significance levels and confidence intervals can be derived.

Thus, we need to aggregate the data to the level of a market/quarter from a market/retailer/quarter. However, we cannot simply construct a simple average of the retailers' prices in a market, because not all retailers are observed in a market in every time period; that is, the composition of retailers observed in a market varies over time. Instead, we construct a price index that controls for retailer/market effects. Specifically, we regress retailer i's (log) price in market j at time t on a retailer/market fixed-effect (&#120572; &#119894;&#119895; ) and a series of time indicators. We estimate these regressions at the retailer/market level.</p>

            <p>Employment of the sys-GMM methodology portends a number of advantages in model estimation beyond providing a solution for simultaneity. It obviates the need for making particular assumptions about the precise distributional form of the error term in the estimating equation, helps to overcome omitted variable bias, and is relatively robust in the presence of <ref type="bibr">43</ref> Estimation of the models is carried out using 'xtabond2' developed for Stata by <ref type="bibr">Roodman (2007)</ref>. Although xtabond2 is mainly used for estimating dynamic models -that is, for which w in equation <ref type="formula">9</ref>) includes single or multiple lags of the dependent variable -it is flexible enough to be employed for static specifications as well <ref type="bibr">(Drukker, 2008)</ref>. We employ (less efficient) one-step estimation procedures since under (more efficient) two-step estimation (which applies an estimated optimal weighting matrix to the firststep estimates and which means the right-hand side varies slightly across equations), adding-up conditions fail to precisely hold. One-step and two-step procedures yield qualitatively similar results regarding the main questions of interest in this study.</p>

            <p>In practice, the within estimator is obtained by carrying out first a within transformation then calculating the least squares estimator on these centred variables. However, this has to be done carefully because, as transformed variables are being used, the standard estimator of the variance obtained with the ordinary least squares procedure does not correspond directly to the unbiased estimator of the variance of the within model. It underestimates it. A multiplying factor (CT -K) / (CT -C -K) needs to be taken into account, where C is the number of cohorts, T the number of observation dates and K the number of explanatory variables. In SAS, the Bwithin macro written by <ref type="bibr">Duguet (1999)</ref> takes this problem into account (for other Stata and R procedures, see <ref type="bibr">Guillerm, 2015)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Issues of implementation of statistical software are not addressed in the articles. Examples of SAS, R and Stata programmes are provided in <ref type="bibr">Guillerm (2015)</ref>, on which the article is based.</p>
            <p>We then checked whether our results were dependant on our identification strategy. In particular, <ref type="bibr">Chauvel and Schroeder (2014)</ref>, who demonstrate that the baby boom generations had more disposable income than other generations and whose results differ from our own, use a different strategy based on <ref type="bibr">Chauvel (2013)</ref>. This is called the Age-Period-Cohort-Detrended (APCD) method and focuses on the fluctuations in the age, cohort and period effects around their respective linear trend. It cannot be used to compare cohorts with one another, only in relation to an unknown coefficient. We present this method in the C4 online supplement and we used the APCD module (available on Stata) with our data in an attempt to reproduce their results.</p>

            <p>Imputation of stage data. To determine the likely stage distribution among women with missing data on stage in each registry, we conducted multiple imputation using chained equations with the ice command in Stata 12, specifying an ordered logistic model <ref type="bibr">(Nur et al, 2010; White et al, 2011)</ref>. We imputed TNM stage I-IV and SEER SS2000. We first used logistic regression models to determine which variables significantly predicted the pattern of missingness or were associated with stage. These variables were included in the imputation models. In all models, we included vital status, the non-linear effect of the log cumulative excess hazard and the non-linear effect of age at diagnosis. Where necessary, we also included subsite, year of diagnosis and interactions between the log cumulative excess hazard and age, year and subsite. We ran each imputation model 15 times and combined the results under Rubin's rules <ref type="bibr">(White et al, 2011)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Net survival was modelled on the log cumulative excess hazard scale in a flexible parametric framework using the stpm2 (Lambert and Royston, 2009) command in Stata version 12 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). The availability of follow-up data beyond the last boundary for which we want to estimate survival is important for the stability of the model, so we present survival estimates up to 3 years, even though we had longer follow-up for some patients <ref type="bibr">(Remontet et al, 2007)</ref>. We also present the excess hazard, the mortality counterpart to net survival, which is the instantaneous rate of dying from breast cancer, over and above all other causes of death, and which shows how breast cancer mortality changes with time after diagnosis.</p>

            <p>In the next step, we explain the choice of our preferred model. As expected, OLS estimates of parameter &#961; are somehow larger than those of FE. However, reported point estimates of parameters using bias-corrected FE (we employed <ref type="bibr">Bruno, 2005 Stata routine)</ref> are almost the same as the FE estimates, which suggest that the Nickell bias seems negligible in our context (and that OLS estimates suffer from omitted variable bias). Also the significance of country dummies suggests that OLS estimates may not be the most reliable ones. Finally, it should be noted that the FE estimates have a relatively small variance, especially if compared to consistent estimators as GMM <ref type="bibr">(M&#225;ty&#225;s and Sevestre, 2008)</ref> or bias-corrected FE. For these reasons, we choose the simple FE estimator as the preferred one. Regarding the specification tests, the Arellano-Bond test for autocorrelation shows that including the lagged dependent variable and year dummies reduces problems with autocorrelation. At no reasonable significance level, the null hypothesis (i.e. that there is no autocorrelation) should be rejected. To deal with heterogeneity we use robust SEs.</p>

            <p>Multilevel models were used to examine hypotheses 1 and 2, pooling across the CARDERA 2-year treatment arms. Multilevel modelling is designed to handle hierarchically nested data, allowing for missing outcome data, and accounting for variation both between participants and within patients over time. These models were estimated using Stata (version 11.0), which provides parameters in the form of unstandardized maximum likelihood estimates (b coefficients), which estimate magnitude and direction of changes in outcome variables associated with differences in predictor variables (in this case, depression/anxiety). All models included random intercepts to account for variation in the outcome variable across individuals. Assessment time was included as a dummy coded variable, with a random time slope to allow for variation in change in the outcome over time across individuals. Alongside the b coefficients, confidence intervals and P-values, we also calculated standardized mean difference effect sizes, to provide an estimate of the standardized effect size of depression/anxiety status on physical health outcomes.</p>

            <p>These illustrative calculations show that not all taxpayers face lower marginal tax rates as a result of the Tax Reform Act. More detailed information on distributional changes in 1988 marginal tax rates is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The figure reports calculations based on the TAXSIM model of the National Bureau of Economic Research. TAXSIM computes marginal tax rates and tax payments for a synthetic population of over 30,000 1988 taxpayers, constructed by extrapolating from actual 1983 tax returns in the 1983 IRS Public Use Tax Return data file. The calculations suggest that 29.3 million taxpayers (27.3 percent of the total) will face higher marginal rates after the tax reform than before. An additional 14.8 million (13.8 percent) face the same marginal rate under the new law as they would have under old law. Increased marginal tax rates are especially prevalent among non-itemizers, the elderly, and low income earners who are not eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit. Although the majority of taxpayers (58.9 percent) do receive rate reductions, only 11.2 percent receive reductions of more than ten percentage points. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">4</ref> One important aspect of the Tax Reform Act that Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> does not reveal is the increased number of low income households that either pay no taxes or receive rebates. TAXSIM calculations indicate that 5.9 million households will be removed from the federal tax rolls as a result of changes in the personal exemption and the <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">4</ref> These calculations weight each tax return equally. Similar findings emerge when we weight tax returns by married couples twice as heavily as those by single persons; 12.1 percent receive marginal rate reductions of 10 percent or more, 11.5 percent face the same marginal rates before and after the reform, and 22.3 percent face higher marginal rates.</p>
            <p>The marginal tax rate facing the average married woman depends on the amount of labor she chooses to supply. For her first hour of work, her marginal tax rate is 15 percent under the new law, compared with 16.2 percent (.90 times 18 percent, due to the ten percent two-earner deduction) under the old law. The two earner deduction influenced marginal work incentives for most couples. TAXSIM shows that only 6.1 percent of two-earner couples would have incomes in 1988 that caused the $3000 deduction constraint to bind. The average married woman's marginal tax rate at part-time work, twenty hours per week, decreases from 22.5 percent (.90 of 25 percent) to 15 percent because of the tax reform. This rate change is probably the major determinant of the increase in labor supply that we found. At full-time work, the average married woman faces a marginal rate of 28 percent, which is a slight reduction from her 29.7 percent rate (.90 times .33) under old law.</p>
            <p>Consider the impact of the tax reform on incentives to save through traditional taxable investments such as bonds, corporate stock, and bank accounts. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> The new bill alters the after-tax return to private saving in two ways. First, by lowering marginal tax rates on most assets, it shrinks the tax wedge between pre-tax and post-tax returns. Calculations with the TAXSIM model illustrate this effect. In 1988, the average marginal tax rate on interest income will be 21.7 percent, compared with 25.8 percent under the old law. The change in marginal tax rates on corporate dividends is even more pronounced, from 33.4 percent to 25.3 percent, although the net effect on the equity tax wedge is smaller because the capital gains tax rate is increased. 18 Some taxpayers receive larger marginal rate reductions, but as <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">King and Leape (1985)</ref> show, these investors already hold lightly-taxed assets such as high-growth corporate stock and tax-exempt debt.</p>
            <p>The Tax Reform Act significantly increases the disposable income of low-income households who may be subject to liquidity constraints. TAXSIM estimates suggest that in 1988 the new law will lower taxes on those with adjusted gross incomes of less than $20,000 by $4.8 billion per year. By comparison, it raises total tax payments by households with AGIs above $75,000 by $5.8 billion annually. These redistributive effects will reduce the aggregate savings rate.</p>

            <p>Aggrecan is upregulated after FeCl 3 induced injury. In addition, we investigated the aggrecan expression in the injured CNS by western blotting. For this analysis, the hemisphere of iron-induced lesion as well as the correspondent contralateral hemisphere were dissected and prepared for subsequent processing. Protein extracts were run in a 6% gel. Western blot analysis with the anti-aggrecan antibody AB1031 revealed a single band at B450 kDa in injured and uninjured hemispheres (Figure <ref type="figure">7a</ref>). A comparative quantification with TINA software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany) revealed higher contents of aggrecan in iron-injected hemispheres for all tested mouse lines, with significant differences in mice lacking brevican or HAPLN1 (Figure <ref type="figure">7b</ref>).</p>

            <p>With the MouseGene 2.0 ST Affymetrix chip, we found not only protein-coding genes that correlate with Rpe65 but also microRNAs and non-coding RNAs. When we examined the top 500 correlates of Rpe65 (all of which have a correlation higher than 0 <ref type="table">2</ref>). Using the bioinformatics tools on TargetScan (Targetscan. org) <ref type="bibr">[22-24]</ref>, we predicted targets for each microRNA from the top 500 correlates of Rpe65. One microRNA, Mir666, did not appear on the TargetScan website. The remaining four microRNAs appeared on the website. When the microRNAs were scanned for targets, Mir98 had 29 targets in the RPE signature, Mir449a had 14 targets, Mir301b had 13 targets, and Mir28b had one target. This type of analysis may be one approach to constructing and understanding microarray networks within a specific cell type such as the mouse RPE.</p>

            <p>From 2006, miRBase provided a set of microRNA target predictions, branded miRBase targets, in collaboration with the Enright lab <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref>. In 2009, the miRBase targets resource was devolved back into the Enright lab at the EBI, and rebranded microCosm. In its place, we will develop an aggregation service that integrates microRNA target predictions from all the popular target prediction sites [for example, TargetScan <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref>, PicTar (20), microCosm, DIANA-microT (21), microrna.org <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>], together with lists of validated microRNA target sites [currently curated by resources such as TarBase (23), miRecords <ref type="bibr">(24)</ref>, miRTarBase]. This will initially involve displaying the top hits from each algorithm on existing miRBase sequence pages. In the longer term, an interface to search for hits from the aggregated algorithms will be developed, and consensus predictions from subsets of the algorithms will be provided. All results will link to the original data sources. To eliminate any long-term curation burden, we will accept depositions of microRNA target predictions and validated targets from users and target prediction groups.</p>

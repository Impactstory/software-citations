<p>Abstract Eliciting the level of risk aversion of experimental subjects is of crucial 
concern to experimenters. In the literature there are a variety of methods used for 
such elicitation; the concern of the experiment reported in this paper is to compare 
them. The methods we investigate are the following: Holt-Laury price lists; pair-
wise choices, the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak method; allocation questions. Clearly 
their relative efficiency in measuring risk aversion depends upon the numbers of 
questions asked; but the method itself may well influence the estimated risk-aver-
sion. While it is impossible to determine a 'best' method (as the truth is unknown) 
we can look at the differences between the different methods. We carried out an 
experiment in four parts, corresponding to the four different methods, with 96 
subjects. In analysing the data our methodology involves fitting preference func-
tionals; we use four, Expected Utility and Rank-Dependent Expected Utility, each 
combined with either a CRRA or a CARA utility function. Our results show that the 
inferred level of risk aversion is more sensitive to the elicitation method than to the 
assumed-true preference functional. Experimenters should worry most about 
context. </p>

<p>Risk attitude is a crucial factor influencing economic behaviour. As a consequence, 
experimenters are interested in eliciting the risk-attitude of their subjects. This can 
be done in two ways: either directly, using the context of a particular experiment to 
estimate the risk-aversion that best explains behaviour; or indirectly, eliciting risk 
aversion in a separate part of the experiment, and using the elicited value to explain 
behaviour in the main experiment. It is to those experimenters that use the latter 
approach to whom this paper is addressed. 
Economic theory posits that decisions under risk depend on how people evaluate, 
and hence decide between, risky lotteries. By these we mean lotteries where the 
outcomes are risky, and where the probabilities are known. Clearly how people 
evaluate lotteries depends not only on the lotteries, but also on the preference 
functionals of the decision-maker (DM). In the literature there are a number of 
proposed preference functionals, the best-known of which is the Expected Utility 
functional. All of these embody the idea of an underlying utility function u(.); it is 
the degree of concavity of this when it is defined over money that indicates the 
degree of risk-aversion. It is this that we are trying to elicit. 
There are a number of methods that are used in the literature to elicit risk 
aversion. Possibly the most popular is that known as the Holt-Laury Price List, 
introduced by Holt and Laury (2002), and which we will refer to as HL. While the 
detail may vary from application to application, the basic idea is simple: subjects are 
presented with an ordered list of pairwise choices and have to choose one of each 
pair. The list is ordered in that one of the two choices is steadily getting better or 
steadily getting worse as one goes through the list. There are many variants on the 
basic theme: sometimes one of the two choices is a certainty, and that is getting 
better or worse through the list; sometimes either just one or both of the choices are 
risky choices and one of them is getting better or worse through the list. Because of 
the ordered nature of the list, subjects should choose the option on one side up to a 
certain point thereafter choosing the option on the other side. Some experimenters 
force subjects to have a unique switch point; others leave it up to subjects. </p>

<p>1 </p>

<p>A second method is to give a set of Pairwise Choices, but separately (not in a list) 
and not ordered. We will refer to this as PC. Typically the pairwise choices are 
presented in a random order. This has been used by Hey and Orme (1994), amongst 
many others. Some argue that this method, whilst being similar to that of Price Lists, 
avoids some potential biases associated with ordered lists. Usually the pairwise 
choices are chosen such that they are distributed over one or more Marschak-
Machina triangles. </p>

<p>2   A method which is elegant from a theoretical point of the view is the Becker-
DeGroot-Marschak mechanism proposed by Becker et al. (1964). This we will later 
denote by Lottery Choice (LC) because of the way that we implement it. The </p>

<p>1 There is a problem with those subjects who switch more than once-as we shall discuss later. </p>

<p>2 This triangle is used to represent lotteries over a set of three outcomes. Two of the probabilities in the 
lotteries are plotted on the vertical and horizontal axes, while the third is the residual from one. The points 
at the vertices are certainties while points properly inside the triangle are lotteries. </p>

<p>method centres on eliciting the value to a subject of a lottery-if we know the value 
that a subject places on a lottery with monetary outcomes, we can deduce the 
individual's attitude to risk over money. There are two variants of this mechanism 
that are used in the literature: one where the DM is told that they own the lottery, 
and hence have the right to play it out or to sell it; and one where the DM is offered 
the chance to buy the lottery, and, if so, to then play out the lottery. The subject's 
valuation of the lottery as a potential seller is the minimum price for which they 
would be willing to sell it, while the subject's valuation of the lottery as potential 
buyer is the maximum price for which they would be willing to buy it. Here we 
describe the mechanism as it relates to a potential buyer-the mechanism is the 
same, mutatis mutandis, if it relates to a potential seller. The subject is asked to state 
a number; then a random device is activated, which produces a random number 
between the lowest amount in the lottery and the highest amount. If the random 
number is less than the stated number, then the subject buys the lottery at a price 
equal to the random number (and then plays out the lottery); if the random number 
is greater, then nothing happens and the subject stays as he or she was. If 
3 the 
subject's preference functional is the expected utility functional then it can be 
shown that this mechanism is incentive compatible and reveals the subject's true 
evaluation of the lottery. Analytically it is equivalent to a Second Price Auction. 
The problem is that subjects do seem to have difficulty in understanding this 
mechanism, and a frequent criticism is that subjects understate their evaluation 
when acting as potential buyers and overstate it when acting as potential sellers. So 
in our experiment we implement this mechanism in a new way, which, we hope, is 
easier for subjects to understand, and which we will explain later. 
The Allocation method, which we shall denote by AL, was originally pioneered 
by Loomes (1991). It was then revived by Andreoni and Miller (2002) in a social 
choice context, and later by Choi et al. (2007) in a risky choice context. This method 
involves giving the subject some experimental money to allocate between various 
states of the world, with specified probabilities for the various states, and, in some 
implementations, with given exchange rates between experimental money and real 
money for each of the states. This method seems easier for subjects to understand 
than BDM. 
This paper is a follow-up, and complement to, the previous literature and, in 
particular, the paper by Loomes and Pogrebna (2014), in which the authors compare 
three of the elicitation methods described above-specifically Holt-Laury price 
lists, Ranking and Allocations. Our paper complements theirs, not only in the 
elicitation methods we consider, but also in that our experimental design (and 
crucially the numbers of questions asked for each method), as well as the data 
analysis, are completely different. We also consider a slightly different set of 
elicitation methods. 
The purpose of this paper is to report on the results of an experiment in which 
subjects were asked to perform each of the four methods described in Sect. 1 above. 
The paper is organised as follows. We start with a literature review of the various 
elicitation methods in Sect. 2, and a survey of previous experimental results in </p>

<p>3 Though this is not necessarily true with other preference functionals. </p>

<p>Context matters </p>



<p>Sect. 3. In Sect. 4 we describe how our experiment was organised and how the 
various methods were implemented in it, giving more detail about each of the 
methods. As we adopt an econometric methodology of fitting preference functionals 
to the data, we specify, in Sect. 5, the preference functionals that we fit to the data 
and describe the functional forms that we assume, and the parameters in them that 
we estimate. In Sect. 6, we describe how we analysed the data, detailing the 
stochastic assumptions that we make. Section 7 contains the results. In Sect. 8 we 
discuss what else we might have done; and Sect. 9 concludes. </p>

<p>2 Review of the various elicitation methods </p>

<p>One clear difference between the methods is in the information that the answers 
give. Pairwise Choices (on which Price Lists are built) merely tell us which of two 
lotteries is preferred, but not by how much. In contrast both the LC and AL give us a 
continuous measure, which is (should be) the outcome of an optimising decision. 
This suggests that the latter two might be more informative, though of course more 
cognitive effort might have to be expended by the subjects. A discussion of the 
various methods can be found in Charness et al. (2013). A complete list, with links 
to descriptions, is given in Table 1. We briefly comment on them below. 
We classify the various methods into four main categories (and variants on 
them), namely: pairwise choice, multi-item choice, 'continuous' 
4 choice and 
ranking. We do not give details but instead categorise the types of the methods and 
the underlying idea behind them. 
In the first category we can obviously include the PC method and the Holt-Laury 
price list method (which comprises sets of ordered pairwise choices). The 'Cups 
Task', the 'Reyna and Ellis Risk Task' and the 'Risk-taking Propensity Measures' 
are special cases of pairwise choice in which one of the lotteries is a certainty. The 
'Two-Outcome Risky Decision Task' is also a special case where both lotteries are 
two-outcome lotteries but one is risky while the other is ambiguous. 
5 The 'Deal or 
No Deal Method' and the 'Dynamic Experiments for Estimating Preferences' are 
dynamic versions of pairwise choice. 
In the multi-option category there is the Eckel and Grossman method (with 
choice over 5 lotteries) and the 'Iowa Gambling Task' (with dynamic choice over 
four options with initially unknown probabilities). 
In the 'continuous' choice category, we start with five methods that have strong 
similarities: the 'Angling Risk Task', the 'Balloon Analog Risk Task', the 
'Columbia Card Task', the 'Devil's Task' and the 'Sequential Investment Task'. 
They all share the same basic idea: subjects have to choose a probability; then either 
some random event does occur with that probability or it does not occur with the 
residual probability; if it does occur the subject gets nothing, and, if it does not 
occur, the subject gets paid some increasing function of the probability. The chosen </p>

<p>4 The quotation marks are there because in an experimental setting it is impossible to provide completely 
continuous choice. 
5 This is used when trying to elicit preferences over ambiguity. </p>

<p>W. Zhou, J. Hey </p>



<p>probability is an indicator of risk aversion. In an obvious sense the subject is 
choosing a distribution of his or her payment. The same is true with the Allocation 
method (which we have described above), the Becker-Degroot-Marschak method 
(which we have described above and which is analytically equivalent to a Second 
Price Auction), the 'Distribution Builder' task (in which subjects are asked to state a 
preferred distribution), the First Price Auction method (in which subjects have to 
state their valuation of a lottery), the Gneezy and Potters method (in which subjects 
are asked to allocate some money between a safe asset and a risky asset), and the 
'Sequential Investment Task'. 
The ranking method offers subjects a choice of lotteries and asks them to rank 
them in order of preference (with an appropriate incentive mechanism). This has 
been used by Bateman et al. (2006) and Loomes and Pogrebna (2014), in addition to 
Carbone and Hey (1994). </p>

<p>3 Previous experimental findings </p>

<p>Table 2 summarises previous experimental work comparing different elicitation 
methods. One recurring message from these previous studies is that there is little 
correlation in the measured degree of risk aversion across different methods. 
However there is one outstanding feature of most of this literature apparent from 
Table 2: namely the very small number of observations per subject: in most of them 
(16 out of the 23 excluding the present paper) only one task is implemented for each 
subject. So for each method there is only one observation. Moreover, in most of 
these (depending upon the elicitation method), this observation can lead only to an 
interval estimate of risk-aversion. In stark contrast, our paper has many tasks for 
each elicitation method and we can get a point estimate of risk attitude. Loomes and 
Pogrebna come closest to what we do, but they make a different use of the data, 
carrying out comparisons across tasks within an elicitation method. In contrast we 
use all our data from each method to estimate risk-aversion. True, it may be the 
case, that with large numbers of tasks, subjects get fatigued and hence possibly 
noisier, but offsetting that is the increased precision from having more observations. 
There are slight differences in the way that different methods were implemented 
in these papers. For example the number of rows in the price lists of HL (usually 10 
or 11), but these are relatively unimportant. There is a common theme to the way 
that the data is analysed in many of these papers: usually it is assumed that the 
preference functional of the subjects is CRRA; under this assumption, intervals for 
the subjects' risk aversions can be derived from the subjects' decisions. This is then 
compared across elicitation methods. Some papers go further-trying to fit a CRRA 
preference functional to the data. One example is Crosetto and Filippin (2016). To 
do this they have to convert their one observation from each method into several 
observations. Take, for example HL. They have one price list with 10 rows and thus 
10 'decisions'. They then interpret these in their econometrics as 10 independent 
observations. We (as will be seen) go to the opposite extreme-interpreting them as 
completely dependent-our view being that subjects will choose a 'switch point' 
and then fill in the table. It is not clear which is the correct assumption. Crosetto and  Filippin (2016) go even further with their Gneezy and Potters data where they say 
that ''we transformed the GP data into 40 binary choices''-assumed to be 
independent choices. 
Some papers estimate an average risk-aversion index (rather than estimating 
subject-by-subject) and some try to explain this with various demographics and 
control variables. 
Crosetto and Filippin (2016) also include something particularly interesting when 
they write: ''We show by means of a simulation exercise that part of the often 
observed heterogeneity of estimates across tasks is due to task-specific measurement 
error induced by the mere mechanics of the tasks.'' This, we suspect, is due to the 
way that the data from the different methods is analysed-using just one task to 
elicit an (interval) estimate of risk-aversion. Our method avoids this possible bias as 
we estimate across a number of tasks. </p>

<p>Context matters </p>



<p>We should note in passing that the 'framing' of the different elicitation methods 
appears to have an influence on the elicited values. This is well-documented by 
Weber et al. (2002) and Lévy-Garboua et al. (2012). It might seem that this is only 
marginally relevant to this paper, though it could be argued that different methods 
are simply one method differently framed. 
Although much research about the relationship between elicitation methods and 
elicited risk preferences has already been carried out, we feel that our paper makes a 
positive contribution to the literature. Our paper is different, not only in the 
elicitation methods considered and contrasted, but also in our experimental design 
and in the number of tasks posed to subjects. We illustrated lotteries as pictures, 
rather than in words, believing that a pictorial representation aids understanding, 
with a consequent reduction in noise. We have a different way of implementing the 
Becker-DeGroot-Marschak method. Our data analysis also differs from virtually all 
of the previous literature: we fit preference functionals to the data. We use 
maximum likelihood techniques to estimate the parameters of our preference 
functionals. We consider not only EU (Expected Utility) preferences but also RD 
(Rank-Dependent Expected Utility), and also two different utility functions-
CRRA and CARA. Thus we estimate different preference functionals, EU-CRRA, 
EU-CARA, RD-CRRA, and RD-CARA; and not only compare the four elicitation 
methods, but also the four preference functionals. We can do this as we have a lot 
more data than most studies. </p>

<p>4 The experimental implementation </p>

<p>We investigated a subset of four of the 20 methods listed in Table 1. We wanted 
them to be different; many of these 20 'overlap'. We chose Holt-Laury (because of 
its popularity), Pairwise Choice (as it is simple), Becker-Degroot-Marschak (again 
because of its popularity) and Allocation (because we think that it is more 
informative than pairwise choice and easier to understand than BDM). These four 
cover many of the 20 of our review. Our experiment was in four parts, 
corresponding to these four methods, with different ordering of the parts for 
different subjects. 
6 We describe the four parts here. All parts of the experiment 
concerned lotteries. The complete set of tasks can be found in https://www.york.ac. 
uk/economics/exec/research/zhouandhey1/. 
Throughout the experiment, lotteries are visually displayed 
7 on the subjects' 
computer screens in two dimensions, with the amount of money on the vertical axis 
and the chances on the horizontal axis. We used the random lottery incentive 
mechanism. If a particular lottery was chosen by this mechanism for paying out at 
the end of the experiment, the subject would draw a disk from a bag of 100 disks 
numbered from 1 to 100. The subject got paid the amount of money corresponding </p>

<p>6 Since we analyse the data across all subjects, possible order effects are cancelled out. </p>

<p>7 We note that this is a different presentation than that used by Loomes and Pogrebna (2014). Theirs is 
more appropriate in their setting; ours in ours as we wanted finer divisions (in steps of 0.01 rather than 
0.1). </p>

<p>W. Zhou, J. Hey </p>



<p>to the number on the disk. Let us give an example. Take the lottery in Fig. 1; this 
represents a lottery where there is a 1 in 2 (50 in 100) chance of gaining £5 and a 1 
in 2 (50 in 100) chance of gaining £15. If this was played out at the end of the 
experiment, if the numbered disk was between 1 and 50 inclusive, the subject was 
paid £5; if it was between 51 and 100 inclusive the subject was paid £15. One of the 
possible advantages of this way of portraying lotteries is that the area indicates the 
expected value of the lottery. 
Part 1 presented a set of 48 
8 Holt-Laury price lists each containing 10 pairwise 
choices. An example is shown in Fig. 2a, b; Fig. 2a showing how it was first seen by 
the subject and Fig. 2b showing it after its possible completion by a subject. These 
are screen shots from the experimental software; they appeared full-screen in the 
experimental interface. In Fig. 2a, the thing that is staying constant is the lottery on 
the left (which is a 70% chance of £15 and a 30% chance of £0); the thing that is 
changing is that on the right-in this case a certainty-which increases from a 
certainty of £1.50 to a certainty of £15. Subjects were asked, for each pair in the list, 
to click on the preferred item; when doing so, the item on the other side turned grey. 
Figure 2b shows a possible set of responses-with the lottery being preferred to the 
certainty until the value of certainty reached £6. To avoid problems with subjects 
switching at several points 
9 within the list, the software forced subjects to choose a 
unique switching point. The 48 Price Lists spanned a variety of cases; details in 
https://www.york.ac.uk/economics/exec/research/zhouandhey1/. We denote this 
method HL (as it comes from Holt-Laury mechanism). 
Part 2 asked subjects to respond to 80 
10 pairwise choice questions. An example is 
shown in Fig. 3. 
In this pairwise choice, subjects had to choose between a lottery which give an 
80% chance of £10 and a 20% chance of £5 and a lottery which give a 40% chance 
of £15 and a 60% chance of £5. The set of 80 pairwise choice questions spanned 
lotteries with outcomes of £0, £5, £10 and £15 with probabilities of 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 
0.8 and 1.0; details in https://www.york.ac.uk/economics/exec/research/ 
zhouandhey1/. We denote this method PC. 
Part 3 asked subjects to respond to 54 
11 Becker-DeGroot-Marschak problems. 
Typically subjects are shown a lottery and asked to state their maximum 
willingness-to-pay or minimum willingness-to-accept for the lottery. Many 
experimenters have reported confusion among subjects with understanding this 
mechanism, so we adopted a new way of implementing it. Suppose that we want to 
find the subject's certainty equivalent of a lottery which pays £x with probability 
p and £y with probability 1 -p, where x [ y. The subject is asked to choose a </p>

<p>8 In contrast Loomes and Pogrebna had just 5 such lists. We used more because pre-experimental 
simulations indicated that to get accuracy in estimation (which is a different objective to that in Loomes 
and Pogrebna) we needed more. 
9 In contrast Loomes and Pogrebna (2014) allowed subjects to switch at several points-but they write 
''the proportion of inconsistent participants in our data set ranged between 1.1 and 5.6%''. It is not 
immediately obvious how to analyse the data from such subjects. 
10 Again these were chosen after pre-experimental simulations; the objective being to get a set of 
problems which would enable us to identify accurately the preference functional and its parameters. 
11 Again these were chosen after pre-experimental simulations. </p>

<p>Context matters </p>



<p>number £z. We want z to be the certainty equivalent. To obtain this in an incentive 
compatible way, 
12 we could tell the subjects that a random number Z will be 
generated from a uniform distribution over the interval (y, x) and that they will get 
paid Z if Z [ z and will get to play out the lottery if Z B z. The optimal choice of 
z is the subject's certainty equivalent of the lottery. Consider the implications in 
terms of what they are choosing: their choice of z implies the choice of a lottery, 
which is a compound of the original lottery and the uniform distribution. To 
illustrate this, consider the lottery in Fig. 4a, where the payoffs are £5 and £15. If 
they state z = 5 they get to play out the lottery; if they state z = 15, they are opting 
for the lottery in Fig. 4b-that is a uniform 
13 distribution over (5,15); if they state 
some number in between, for example 11, they are opting for the lottery in Fig. 4c. 
As z is varied from 5 to 15, the lottery in Fig. 4c varies from that in Fig. 4a to that in 
Fig. 4b. We simply asked them to choose their preferred lottery; they did this by 
moving the slider below the graph and then clicking on 'Confirm'. The implied </p>

from a bag containing disks numbered from 1 to 100, and the vertical axis displays the corresponding 
payoff. As the numbers on the horizontal axis are uniformly distributed so are those on the vertical axis. It 
should not be interpreted as a probability density function. </p>

The 54 LC problems spanned lotteries with outcomes of £0, £5, £10 and £15, and 
with probabilities ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 in steps of 0.1; details in https://www. 
york.ac.uk/economics/exec/research/zhouandhey1/. 
Part 4 asked subjects to respond to 81 allocation problems. 
14 An example is 
shown in Fig. 5. In this example, the two states (red and yellow) have probabilities 
0.7 and 0.3 respectively. Subjects have 100 tokens to allocate, and the exchange 
rates between tokens and money are 1 token = 17.5p for red, and 1 token = 10p for 
yellow. They made their allocation with the slider, with the figure showing the 
implied amounts of money (and their probabilities). The 81 allocation problems 
spanned probabilities ranging from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.1 with varying exchange 
rates; details in https://www.york.ac.uk/economics/exec/research/zhouandhey1/. 
We denote this method AL. </p>

<p>Fig. 3 A pairwise choice </p>

<p>14 Loomes and Pogrebna (2014) had just 13, but theirs were over three states and the exchange rates were 
always 1-1. We adopted a two-way allocation with non-unitary exchange rates partly because it is easier 
for subjects to understand, but more crucially because the econometric analysis of the data is simpler. The 
number of problems was again chosen after pre-experimental simulations. </p>

<p>5 Functional forms assumed </p>

<p>While we are primarily interested in the differences in the estimated risk attitudes 
between the different elicitation methods, in order to understand these differences 
we need to model behaviour and hence estimate the risk attitude. To model the 
behaviour we 
15 need to choose preference functionals. We do not know the 
preference functionals of our subjects, so we have to choose a set of such 
functionals and use our data to find the best-fitting one(s). We choose the most 
popular in the literature, namely Expected Utility (EU) and Rank Dependent 
expected utility (RD). 
Let us denote by V the value to a subject of a 3-outcome lottery which pays x i 
with probability p i (for i = 1,2,…,3), and let us order the payoffs so that 
x 1 C x 2 C x 3 , then we have </p>

<p>for EU: u V 
ð Þ ¼ p 1 u x 1 
ð Þ þ p 2 u x 2 
ð Þ þ p 3 uðx 3 Þ </p>

<p>for 
RD: u V 
ð Þ ¼ w p 1 
ð Þu x 1 
ð Þ þ w p 1 þ p 2 
ð 
ÞÀw p 1 
ð Þ 
½ 
u x 2 
ð Þ þ 1 À w p 1 þ p 2 
ð 
Þ 
½ 
p 3 uðx 3 Þ </p>

<p>In these expressions, u(.) is the underlying utility function of the subject and w(.) is 
the rank-dependent weighting function. 
We need to specify the utility function u(.) which appears in both these 
functionals. We adopt both the constant Relative Risk aversion (RR) form and the 
constant Absolute Risk aversion (AR) form. These are given by </p>

<p>for RR: u x 
ð Þ ¼ x 
1Àr = 1 À r 
ð 
Þ; r 6 ¼ 1; ln x 
ð Þ; r ¼ 1 </p>

<p>Fig. 5 An allocation </p>

<p>15 By this 'we' mean when using our methodology; that of Loomes and Pogrebna and others differs. We 
have already discussed some of these in Sect. 3. </p>

<p>Context matters </p>



<p>for AR: u x 
ð Þ ¼ À exp Àrx 
ð 
Þ; r 6 ¼ 0; x; r ¼ 0: </p>

<p>We note that in both cases r = 0 corresponds to risk-neutrality and increases in 
r imply greater risk aversion, but there is no mapping between the r for RR and that 
for AR. This is because the r in RR is a measure of relative risk-aversion, while the 
r in AR is a measure of absolute risk-aversion. 
In fitting the RD specifications we also need to specify a weighting function for 
the probabilities. This we take to be of the following form (Tversky and Kahneman  1992): </p>

<p>w p 
ð Þ ¼ p 
g = p 
g þ 1 À p 
ð 
Þ </p>

<p>g </p>

<p>½ </p>

<p>
1=g </p>

<p>In the results that follow we fit, for all four elicitation methods, the four possible 
combinations of the two preference functionals and the two utility functions, using 
the obvious notation RREU, RRRD, AREU and ARRD. Essentially we want to see 
which of these best explains the data and we also want to see whether the estimated 
parameters differ across the elicitation methods; we do this on a subject-by-subject 
basis, as it is clear that subjects are different. </p>

<p>6 Our stochastic assumptions and econometric methodology </p>

<p>We should comment on our econometric methodology, as it is different from that 
used by others. We treat subjects as different, so we analyse subject-by-subject. </p>

<p>16   We also use simultaneously all the responses of the subjects on all problems of a 
particular elicitation method (and use them for estimation), rather than compare 
responses on particular problems. The latter is what Loomes and Pogrebna (2014)  and many others have done. So, for example, in their Table 1 on their page 578, 
they look at the distribution of responses 
17 for particular decision tasks and compare 
these distributions across tasks. They note that the distributions are different across 
tasks, sometimes significantly so. This could be the case because of noise in 
subjects' responses but they present no way of modelling this noise, though the use 
of a statistical test (in this case a Mann-Whitney test) does necessarily involve some 
implicit assumption about stochastics. 
Another difference between our methodology and that of others is in the number 
of problems we present to our subjects: pre-experimental simulations show that one 
needs large numbers of observations to get precise estimates since there is a lot of 
noise in subjects' behaviour. Unfortunately there is a downside to having a large 
number of problems if subject fatigue is increased and because the financial 
incentive per decision is reduced, we might get increased noise and decreased 
precision. </p>

<p>16 We could additionally fit a mixture model to the data, thus estimating distributions of the relevant 
parameters over all subjects, but this would miss the point as we want to investigate subject-by-subject 
estimated risk attitudes across elicitation methods. 
17 This implies particular levels of risk-aversion. </p>

<p>W. Zhou, J. Hey </p>



<p>Our econometric methodology is to fit, for each of RREU, RRRD, AREU and 
ARRD, the models to the decisions of the subjects, for each of the four elicitation 
methods, and hence obtain estimates of the risk aversion index (and also the other 
parameters). We do this by Maximum Likelihood, using <rs id="software-2" type="software">Matlab</rs> (the program is 
available in <rs corresp="#software-2" type="url">https://www.york.ac.uk/economics/exec/research/zhouandhey1</rs>/). To do 
this we need to make assumptions about the stochastic nature of the data. This arises 
from errors made by the subjects. We largely follow convention. </p>

<p>• HL: we assume that the subject calculates the utility difference between the two 
lotteries for each pair in the list, but makes an error in the calculation. Further, 
embodying the fact that the list is presented as a list, we assume that the subject 
makes the same error for each pair; we further assume that this error has a 
normal distribution with mean 0 and precision (the inverse of the standard 
deviation) s. Then the switch-point decision is taken on the basis of where this 
utility difference plus error changes from positive to negative or vice versa. 
• PC: we assume that on each problem the subject calculates the utility difference 
between the two lotteries, but makes an error in this calculation; we further 
assume that this error is independent across problems and has a normal 
distribution with mean 0 and precision (the inverse of the standard deviation) s. 
So that the decision is taken on the basis of the sign of the utility difference plus 
error. 
• LC: we assume that the subject calculates the certainty equivalent of the lottery, 
but makes an error in this calculation; we further assume that this error has a 
normal distribution with mean 0 and precision (the inverse of the standard 
deviation) s. So that the observed certainty equivalent is the subject's true 
equivalent plus error. 
• AL: we assume that the subject calculates the optimal allocation that he or 
should make, but makes an error in this calculation; we further assume that this 
error has a normal distribution with mean 0 and precision (the inverse of the 
standard deviation) s. So that the observed allocation is the optimal allocation 
plus error. </p>

<p>We note that the s in the HL and PC stories are on a different scale than the s in 
the PC and AL stories-the former being on utilities and the latter on money. </p>

<p>7 Results </p>

<p>We had 96 subjects, who each completed all four parts of the experiment. For each 
subject and for each elicitation method, we attempted to fit the four models RREU, 
RRRD, AREU and ARRD to their decisions; so for each subject 16 models were 
estimated. This implies a total of 1536 estimations. In certain cases the estimation 
did not converge. This was for a variety of reasons which we discuss below. In the 
table below we enumerate these cases by elicitation method. It will be seen from this 
table that the 'worst offender' is PC. There were a total of 20 subjects where 
convergence was not obtained on at least one method. As the point of the paper is to </p>

<p>Context matters </p>



<p>compare different elicitation methods, we exclude all these 20 subjects from the 
analysis that follows [though an online appendix (https://www.york.ac.uk/ 
economics/exec/research/zhouandhey1/) repeats parts of the analyses with all 96 
subjects]. </p>

<p>These cases of non-convergence took several forms: (1) where the subject was 
clearly either risk-neutral or risk-loving-in which cases the implied parameters are 
not unique; (2) where the estimation hit the bounds imposed by us on the 
parameters 
18 ; (3) where the subject appeared not to understand the tasks, or where 
the subject appeared to be responding randomly. 
We present our results in two main parts. In Sect. 7.1 we present some 
summary statistics. Then in Sect. 7.2 we compare the estimated parameters across 
preference functionals for given elicitation methods; finally in Sect. 7.3 we 
compare the estimated parameters across elicitation methods for given preference 
functionals. </p>

<p>7.1 Summary statistics </p>

<p>Table 3 presents some summary statistics. 
19 It is very clear from this that the 
estimated parameters vary widely across the different elicitation methods. For 
example, using AL the risk-aversion index elicited in the RR specifications is, on 
average, much higher that found with the other methods, and also has a much 
higher spread. It may well be that the elicitation method is affecting the way that 
subjects process the problems. For example the allocation method may be 
focussing subjects' minds on what outcome they might obtain for different states 
of the world. </p>

<p>7.2 A comparison of the estimated parameters across preference 
functionals </p>

<p>20 </p>

<p>The parameters of the various specifications are the risk-aversion index r (for both 
the EU and the RD functionals), the weighting function parameter g (for the RD 
functional) and the precision parameter s for all specifications. Some of these 
parameters are comparable across preference functionals (in that they have the same 
definition and interpretation) and some are not (like r with RR and r with RA-as 
the first measures the degree of relative risk aversion and the second the degree of 
absolute risk aversion). Table 4 shows the relationships between them for those that 
are comparable; Table 5 shows the relationships for those that are not comparable. 
Let us start with Table 4 where estimates are comparable. We can compare 
g across RRRD and ARRD, and similarly we can compare s across the various 
preference functionals. Also we can compare the r between RREU and RRRD, and 
between AREU and ARRD, though clearly if the true preference functional is Rank 
Dependent then assuming Expected Utility preferences may lead to bias. Table 4 
reports the correlation (q) between the estimated parameters for different elicitation 
methods and the intercept (a) and slope (b) of a linear regression of one against the 
other. If they were consistently producing the same estimates then a should be zero, 
and b (and the correlation coefficient) should be one. Table 4 shows that the 
estimated values of s, across preference functionals, are generally not too far apart. 
For example, the estimated values of s (the precision parameter) using the AL 
method are very close whether we fit RREU or RRRD. This is less true for the 
estimated values of g (the weighting function parameter), though they are very 
similar using the LC method whether we fit RRRD or ARRD. However this is not 
always the case: for example, there are big differences between the estimated values 
of g using the PC method depending on whether we fit RRRD or ARRD. The 
estimated r values differ more markedly across the elicitation methods, though once 
again there are cases (using LC and comparing RREU and RRRD) where the fit is 
good. Even though it is difficult to summarise a whole table in one sentence, one 
could say that the correlations are all positive and reasonably large, and certainly 
larger than in Table 5 (comparisons across elicitation methods), which we shall 
come to shortly. 
Some of the parameters are not comparable. Crucially the r parameter differs 
between the Constant Absolute Risk Aversion specification and the Constant 
Relative Risk Aversion specification in both what it measures and its scale; 
moreover there is no precise mapping between them. However increases in either 
imply a higher risk-aversion so that they should be positively related. Table 5 shows 
the results. Again the correlations are reasonably high. 
We can also show the results graphically. We show here just a subset-the full 
set can be found in https://www.york.ac.uk/economics/exec/research/zhouandhey1/. 
Figure 6 shows the scatter of the estimated r values using the AL method across 
preference functionals. This figure suggests that getting the functional form wrong </p>

<p>20 This sub-section can safely be skipped for those solely interested in the comparison across elicitation 
methods. </p>

<p>W. Zhou, J. Hey </p>



<p>does not upset our estimation of the risk-aversion of the subjects. (Deck et al. (2008)  also present such scatters and make the same point, though their risk-aversion 
indices are not estimated.) However, the figure of the estimated g values using the 
AL method across preference functionals (available in https://www.york.ac.uk/ 
economics/exec/research/zhouandhey1/) suggests that if we get the utility function 
wrong then the estimate of the probability weighting parameter g may be quite 
seriously wrong.

functionals

<p>method across the preference functionals. The scatters are almost always along the 
45 degree line (as Table 4 shows). This means that, whether we assume RR or AR 
preferences, we get almost the same estimate of the noise in subjects' responses. 
We continue to analyse the different elicitation methods across preference 
functionals, and now consider those where the estimated parameters are not 
comparable. Table 5 gives the detail. Here we keep the elicitation method constant 
in each row and report the intercept, slope and correlation coefficient of the 
regression of an estimated parameter for each preference functional against the 
estimated parameter for each of the other preference functionals. Because of the 
lack of a relationship between the two parameters, other than monotonic increasing-
ness, the obvious test to carry out is that the slope is positive; significance is good 
and this is reported in the b column. We also include a test of whether the intercept 
is significantly different from 0-as it should be. The results show that it is usually 
significantly different from zero. </p>

<p>7.3 A comparison of the estimated parameters across elicitation methods </p>

<p>This is the central part of the paper. Here we compare the estimated parameters 
across elicitation methods. Table 6 gives a summary, while Figs. 7, 8 and 9 present 
a subset of graphical comparisons (the full set of 60 sets of comparisons can be 
found in https://www.york.ac.uk/economics/exec/research/zhouandhey1/). Let us 
start with Fig. 7 which shows the 6 scatters for the estimated r value for the RRRD 
functional; each scatter being the estimated values using one elicitation method 
plotted against the estimated values using another elicitation method, for all the non-
excluded subjects. Figure 7 corresponds to rows 13-18 of Table 6. As the scales on 
the two axes differ, it helps to fit a regression line to the scatter. Table 6 gives the 
intercept (-0.230) and slope (0.340) of this line. The intercept is significantly 
different from zero (at the 5% level) and the slope is significantly different from one 
(at 1%), as the asterisks indicate. As can be seen, the risk-aversion index elicited by 
AL is generally greater than that elicited by LC. This could result from what might 
be called a built-in bias with the allocation method-subjects tend to make allo-
cations to avoid large differences in their payoff depending on which state occurs 
(thus encouraging risk-averse behaviour), while the BDM mechanism does not 
make so explicit the possible consequences of their actions. Indeed generally the 
risk-aversion elicited under allocation is generally higher than for the other three 
methods. 
Relative to the others, the comparison discussed above (r for RRRD across 
elicitation methods) is one of the better comparisons. Examine Fig. 8 which shows 
the 6 scatters for the estimated r value for the AREU functional (corresponding to 
rows 31-36 of Table 6). Here, as Table 6 shows, 4 of the 6 intercept values are 
significantly different from zero and 4 of the 6 slope values significantly different 
from 1, so the different elicitation methods are generally leading to significantly 
different estimates. Once again the allocation method seems to be inducing more 
risk-averse behaviour. Figure 9, comparing different estimates of the precision </p>

<p>parameter s for RRRD across the different methods (corresponding to rows 19-24 of 
Table 6) shows that sometimes the relationship is negative. Here the precision 
seems to be lower with the allocation method, and possibly highest on the Pairwise 
Choice method, though a direct comparison does not make much sense as the error 
on PC is on the utility difference (between the two lotteries) while the error on AL is 
on the difference in the amounts of implied money. 
The figure of the estimated g values in RRRD across elicitation methods 
(corresponding to rows 25-30 of Table 6, available in https://www.york.ac.uk/ 
economics/exec/research/zhouandhey1/) is arguably the worst, usually showing 
very little relationship between the elicited g values for RRRD. Here the g value for 
the LC method seems to have the largest variation in the estimated values and that 
for PC having the smallest. 
Finally, even though the different elicitation methods seem to disagree on the 
estimates of the parameters, we should ask whether at least they agree on the best-
fitting preference functional. Table 7 gives the results, with the criterion for the </p>

Bayes information criterion (both of which correct the log-likelihood for the number 
of parameters involved in the fitting). Table 7 shows that correcting for degrees of 
freedom does make a big difference. But here again, the different elicitation 
methods disagree: it is clear that AL puts the AR specifications first, while the other 
methods suggest that RR fits better. Moreover there is no general agreement as to 
which of EU and RD is the best. </p>

<p>8 Qualifications </p>

<p>We have explored one dimension of the key issue of how 'best' to elicit the risk 
attitudes of subjects-though the issue is clouded by the fact that we do not, and 
cannot, know the 'true' risk attitude of our subjects. This is, of course, assuming that 
there is a risk-attitude out there to measure. There are some who think that risk 
attitude varies with the context, and it may be that which we are picking up. If that is 
true, then, if one is planning to use the elicited risk attitudes to explain behaviour in 
some economic problem, it would seem sensible to elicit the risk attitude in the 
same context as the economic problem. The simplest way of doing this is by 
eliciting the risk attitude from behaviour in the economics problem itself-that is, 
by finding the risk attitude which best explains their behaviour in that problem. So 
the risk attitude is elicited as a by-product of studying behaviour in some economic 
problem. 
If, however, one believes that there is a risk attitude out there, one can criticise 
what we have done on other grounds. There are several dimensions to the problem. </p>

<p>We have studied two: the elicitation method and the functional specification. But 
there is also the dimension of the stochastic assumptions used when analysing the 
data. As Wilcox (2008) points out ''choices of stochastic models may be far more 
consequential than choices of structures such as expected utility or rank-dependent 
utility.'' But notice that he is comparing different functionals (which is what we do) 
and not different elicitation mechanisms. In that paper he shows that, when using the 
pairwise choice method for eliciting risk attitudes, the stochastic assumptions can 
lead to markedly changed elicited values. Once again one does not know the 'true' 
risk attitude, so one cannot declare one stochastic specification to be the 'best'. 
Chapter 6 of Bardsley et al. (2010), Blavatskyy and Pogrebna (2010) and Stott  (2006) make the same point. Wilcox (2008) looks solely at pairwise choice 
problems. He considers a variety of stochastic specifications, most varying in their 
heteroscedasticity. Our stochastic specifications are all homoscedastic. Given the 
different nature of our methods, it is clearly not the case that we can apply the same 
set of heteroscedastic models to each method, so it is not clear what comparisons 
one can make. But to go some way to meeting this criticism we have refitted our 
allocation data with an heteroscedastic specification-a Beta distribution. 
21 The 
figure of the results can be found in https://www.york.ac.uk/economics/exec/ 
research/zhouandhey1/. In the figure, the left-hand graph is a scatter of the risk-
aversion estimates for RREU obtained using the allocation method with a beta 
stochastic specification against that with the normal specification that we have used. 
The right-hand graph is the corresponding graph for RRRD. It will be seen that the 
estimates do differ a little with the stochastic specifications but the correlations are 
high (0.985 and 0.933 respectively). 
So there are variations in the estimates produced with the different elicitation 
methods, and (smaller?) variations with different stochastic specifications. The latter 
may cancel out the former, and indeed it may be the case that with each pair of 
elicitation methods there is a pair of stochastic specifications for which the same 
estimates are produced. This is unlikely but suggests an interesting project for future

<p>9 Conclusions </p>

<p>One clear conclusion that emerges from our results is that the elicitation method-
the context-does matter to the estimated risk-aversion index: there are big 
differences in the estimated risk attitudes across the elicitation methods. The choice 
of the preference functional seems to be less important. The choice of the utility 
function seems to be even less important. 
This appears to send a clear message: risk-aversion should be elicited in the 
context in which it is to be interpreted. This suggests that one should estimate the 
risk-aversion index along with the other parameters of the model being fitted to the </p>

<p>21 We assume that the actual allocations, instead of being normally distributed and centred on the optimal 
allocations, have a beta distribution centred on the optimal allocations. Specifically we have used 
x*(1 -s) and (1 -x*)s as the parameters of the Beta distribution (where x* denotes the optimal 
allocation) which ensures that the mean is x* and the variance x*(1 -x*)/s. </p>

<p>Context matters </p>



<p>data; eliciting them in another context could lead to mis-interpretations of the data. 
As Loomes and Pogrebna (2014) write ''In the short run, one recommendation is 
that researchers who wish to take some account of and/or make some adjustment for 
risk attitude in their studies should take care to pick an elicitation procedure as 
similar as possible to the type of decision they are studying…''. We would even go 
as far as suggesting modifying ''as similar as possible'' to ''in the same decision 
problem''. To give an example, in an experiment on First price auction behaviour, 
testing whether subjects are following the Nash-optimal risk-averse strategy, one 
can find the risk-aversion which best explains the bidding decisions of the subjects. 
This is effectively what Isaac and James (2000) do. 
In summary, our results suggest something that has been found elsewhere 
(largely in the psychological literature): namely, that subjects do not have a 
stable preference functional for making decisions under risk. One thing that could 
be done, as we have hinted above, is to investigate more carefully the stochastic 
component of decision-making, and make the stochastic specifications specific to 
the method. Or we could take up Loomes and Pogrebna's call to understand better 
''how contextual or procedural factors interact with that process [of decision-
making].'' This is an important point. It suggests that economists should look at the 
process of decision-making, try and understand how people take decisions, and 
come up with behaviourally plausible preference stories relevant to particular 
elicitation methods. This suggests that risk-aversion might only have a meaning 
with a particular elicitation method, or, as we put it, in a particular context. 
Payne et al. (1992) make a similar point when they argue that ''preferences are 
often constructed rather than merely revealed'': that the strategy used to make a 
decision can be affected by the characteristics of the decision problem. They suggest 
that the selection of the strategy may be based on the tradeoff between effort and 
accuracy. This might be one possible explanation of our findings: for complicated 
elicitation methods, subjects might not be willing to expend sufficient effort to work 
out the 'correct' solution. In contrast, for simple elicitation methods, where less 
effort is required, subjects are more likely to reveal their 'true preferences'. This 
point is echoed by Sher and McKenzie (2006), who argue that the 'frame' (the 
elicitation method) may affect decision-making, and by Hsee (1996), who reinforces 
Payne et al.'s point above. In our terminology, the context, or the frame, or the 
elicitation method, may affect decisions, and hence matter. </p>

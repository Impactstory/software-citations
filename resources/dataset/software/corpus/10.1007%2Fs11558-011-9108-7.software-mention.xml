<p>Abstract Since 1944, United States financing of the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) has been appropriated and approved in Congress by roll-call vote. If voting to 
increase funds to the IMF is viewed as an observable signal of "support" for the 
IMF, these votes provide a historical record of legislative support for the IMF in the 
United States. I analyze roll-call voting on IMF financing from 1944 to 2009 at both 
the aggregate (congressional) and the micro (legislator) levels. At the aggregate 
level, I show that support for the IMF has fallen over time in the House of 
Representatives but not in the Senate. In the micro-analysis, I use a "natural 
experiment" to establish that this intercameral difference is the result of the Senate's 
larger and more heterogeneous constituencies, as opposed to other modeled and 
unmodeled factors. I also find that legislator support for the IMF is shaped strongly 
by ideology: regardless of chamber, left-wing legislators are as much as 31 
percentage points more likely to support the IMF than right-wing legislators. Yet 
controlling for ideology, senators are more likely to support the IMF than 
representatives, and representatives are more sensitive to constituency pressures 
than senators. I attribute these differences to chamber-specific rules governing the 
size of constituencies. </p>

<p>When Congress authorized United States participation in the International Monetary 
Fund (IMF) in 1944, it retained the "power of the purse" indefinitely, meaning that 
any subsequent increase in U.S. financing for the IMF would require congressional 
authorization and appropriation. Over the years, the IMF has requested more 
resources from the United States (and other member nations), to accommodate 
growth in the world economy and to meet crisis needs for balance of payments 
financing. In each instance, both houses of Congress considered and authorized the 
funding increases. These IMF funding authorizations, and the roll-call votes that 
accompanied them, are the focus of this paper. 
From a social science standpoint, congressional roll-call of voting on IMF 
financing is important because it provides an observable record of individual and 
aggregate support for the IMF within the United States. When an individual 
legislator votes in favor of increasing U.S. funding of the IMF, it signals the 
lawmaker's approval of the IMF and its mission-loosening the purse strings is 
equivalent to a vote of support for the IMF. 
1 Likewise, when financing bills are 
passed by large majorities in the House of Representatives and the Senate, it sends 
the message that aggregate political support for the IMF is high in the United States. 
By contrast, when legislators vote against IMF financing, individually or as a 
majority, it signals opposition to the IMF and its practices. In short, congressional 
financing decisions convey information about legislative support and opposition to 
the IMF in the United States, the nation that is the largest contributor to the IMF and 
its most powerful member. 
I motivate my "micro" analysis of legislator voting on the IMF with a survey of 
aggregate legislative support for the IMF over time (where aggregate support is 
measured as the share of all legislators voting in favor for new IMF funding 
commitments). These time series reveal a stark difference across the chambers of 
Congress: while aggregate support for the IMF was initially high in both the House 
and the Senate, support has fallen steadily in the House but not the Senate. 
Explaining this intercameral difference is one of the goals of this paper. 
The heart of the paper is a micro-analysis of individual voting decisions by 
legislators. An innovation over previous work is that I have assembled roll-call 
voting data back to the IMF's founding in 1944 (Broz 2008; Broz and Hawes 2006a, 
b). In addition, I have roll-call votes from both houses of Congress over this period. 
The longer panel dataset allows me to examine how support for the IMF has 
changed over time; the roll-calls from both chambers of Congress allow me to see 
how institutional differences across the chambers affects legislator voting. 
Building on previous work, I show that legislator "ideology" is the most important 
influence on how legislators view the IMF, both over time and across chambers. 
Controlling for other factors and including roll-call fixed effects, I find that moving a </p>

<p>1 Legislators' votes might not be straightforward manifestations of preferences in the presence of party 
pressure, executive influence, or vote-buying and logrolling. In the statistical analysis, I control for some 
of the factors that intervene between legislators' preferences and their roll call votes. </p>

<p>J.L. Broz </p>

<p>
Republican legislator one standard deviation to the "right" reduces her likelihood of 
voting in support of the IMF by 31 percentage points. 
2 Moving a Democrat to the right 
by the same increment lowers her odds of supporting the IMF by 24 percentage points. 
This supports the argument that legislators use ideology as a simple schema for 
determining positions on the IMF and its operations. Right-wing politicians tend to 
oppose the IMF because they see it as providing "bailouts" that insulate international 
investors and foreign borrowers from the risks of their actions. By contrast, left-leaning 
politicians tend to focus on market failures and see a positive role for the IMF in 
mitigating crises that result from imperfections in international financial markets. My 
results show that a left-leaning ideological position is an important source of legislator 
support for the IMF, going all the way back to the founding of the institution. 
I also find micro-level evidence that senators are more supportive of the IMF 
than representatives. Controlling for political party and roll-call fixed effects, 
Senate Democrats are 10 percentage points more likely than House Democrats to 
support the IMF, and Senate Republicans are 17 percentage points more likely 
than House Republicans to favor the IMF. I attribute this to the Senate's large, 
statewide constituencies that encompass more cross-cutting groups and interests 
than House congressional districts. Larger constituencies lead the Senate to be 
more supportive of the IMF than the House, just as the Senate is more supportive 
of free trade than the House. My best evidence is drawn from a "natural 
experiment" that takes advantage of the fact that certain senators and 
representatives have identical constituencies. Due to their small populations, 
states such as Vermont, Delaware, South Dakota and Wyoming are apportioned 
just one "Representative-at-Large" to represent the entire state. To test whether 
larger constituencies increase support for the IMF, I compare the votes cast by 
representatives-at-large with the votes of senators from these same states. I find 
that representatives' votes on the IMF are not statistically different than the votes 
of senators when they have identical constituencies. This result holds when I 
control for the time until the next election, which is one of the important 
differences between the House and Senate. When senators register more support 
for the IMF than representatives, it is because they have larger and more diverse 
constituencies, rather than because they face election less frequently than 
representatives. 
I also test the related institutional hypothesis that the House is more susceptible to 
pressures from constituent groups and special interests than the Senate. I find 
evidence that receiving more campaign contributions from money center banks, 
having more skilled "pro-globalization" workers in a district, and having more 
workers employed in export industries increase the likelihood that a representative 
will vote to approve new financing for the IMF. By contrast, having more workers 
employed in import-competing industries reduces the likelihood a representative will 
vote to approve money for the IMF. None of these constituency and special interest 
influences holds for senators, however. I find that senators are better insulated, due 
to their large districts, from the societal pressures that House members face when 
voting on the IMF. </p>

<p>2 My measure of legislator ideology is from Poole and Rosenthal (1997), who use spatial modeling to map 
legislator positions on a dominate left-right dimension. </p>

<p>The United States Congress and IMF financing, 1944-2009 </p>

<p>
The plan of the article is as follows. In Section 2, I describe the relationship 
between Congress and the IMF and the congressional procedures for ratifying IMF 
requests for more resources. I provide information on all IMF funding increases to 
come before Congress since 1944 and the associated congressional roll-call votes on 
these allocations. Section 3 contains the aggregate analysis of congressional support 
for the IMF, along with conjectures about the institutional sources of intercameral 
differences in IMF support. In Section 4, I develop and test these arguments with 
micro-level voting data from Congress. Section 5 provides a summary and the 
implications of my research. </p>

<p>2 Congress and IMF Funding Increases </p>

<p>The basic terms of U.S. participation in the IMF have not changed 
substantively from the original law: the Bretton Woods Agreements Act of 
1944 (Public Law 171, 79th Congress). Congress delegated some important 
functions to the Executive Branch: the President appoints the U.S. Executive 
Director to the IMF, and the Executive Director is ordered by law to clear his 
or her decisions with the Secretary of the Treasury. But Congress retained final 
authority over certain IMF policy areas, including funding increases. Table 1 
identifies the key IMF policy areas and indicates whether congressional action is 
required by U.S. law in each area. Quota increases for the United States, as well as 
supplemental loans to the IMF via the General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB) </p>

<p>J.L. Broz </p>

<p>
and the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB), require congressional authorization 
and appropriation. 
"Quotas" are the capital subscriptions that member governments make to the IMF. 
Quotas serve as the IMF's main resource for international stabilization activities and 
also determine member governments' voting power-vote shares in the IMF are tied 
to contributions. Quotas can be increased for all members under a "General Review 
of Quotas," which must be conducted at least every 5 years. 
3 If a General Review 
results in the approval of a quota increase, Congress must ratify the U.S. increase. 
Table 2 provides a summary of all General Quota Reviews since the founding of the 
IMF. As indicted in Column 3, General Reviews have produced eight major quota 
increases since 1944. In each instance, Congress was required to approve the 
increase in the U.S. quota. 
While quotas are its main source of financing, the IMF supplements its resources 
during emergencies by borrowing directly from the United States (and other 
industrial countries) through the GAB and the NAB. The flexibility and importance 
of supplemental borrowing was made evident during the recent "subprime" global 
financial crisis. On April 2, 2009, members of the G-20 agreed to increase the NAB 
by up to $500 billion to combat the crisis. The United States committed to a $100 
billion increase to the NAB and the overall agreement was ratified by the Executive 
Board of the IMF on April 12, 2010. Given U.S. law, President Obama needed to 
secure Congressional approval for two actions: the increase of $100 billion for U.S. 
participation in the expanded NAB, and an increase of $8 billion in the U.S. quota 
needed to implement the April 2008 IMF quota reform package. This proved to be 
difficult due to opposition from what the Wall Street Journal called "an unlikely 
coalition of Republicans, left-wing Democrats and anti-globalization activists" 
(Davis and Hitt 2009, A10). 
I exploit the feature of American law that requires all increases in U.S. quotas and 
loans to the IMF to be approved by Congress. I assume that voting to authorize more 
resources for the IMF is signal of support for the IMF since providing more 
resources to the IMF allows it to engage in more international financial operations. </p>

<p>4 </p>

<p>Hence, congressional voting provides an opportunity for understanding patterns of 
support and opposition to the IMF within the United States. 
Table 3 provides summary information on the roll-call votes analyzed in this 
paper. The sample is limited in several ways. First, I include only votes where the 
IMF funding allocation is the sole or primary content, which is to say that I do not 
include votes on omnibus spending bills that bundle IMF funding with various 
unrelated expenditures. 
5 For example, Senate vote #126 in the 98th Congress (1983-84) </p>

<p>3 Article III, Section 2(a) of the IMF's Articles of Agreement provides that "the Board of Governors shall 
at intervals of not more than 5 years conduct a general review, and if it deems it appropriate propose an 
adjustment, of quotas of members." 
4 In the presence of logrolling, legislators' positions on the IMF would be hard to discern from their voting 
behavior. Suppose legislator A votes in favor of an IMF funding bill that she mildly opposes but that is 
strongly favored by legislator B. In exchange, legislator B votes for a farm allocation that he mildly 
opposes, but that is strongly favored by legislator A. In this instance, A's vote for the IMF does not 
accurately convey her mild opposition to the institution. 
5 Vote data were obtained and cross-checked from two sources: Voteview (http://voteview.com/) and 
Thomas (http://thomas.loc.gov). When these sources did not agree on the content of a vote, further 
information was obtained from the Congressional Record (http://www.gpoaccess.gov/crecord/index.html). </p>

was to pass S.695, the International Recovery and Financial Stability Act. While this 
Act included a quota increase for the IMF and new money for the GAB, it also 
addressed the Export-import Bank, the supervision of international banking activities, 
multilateral development banks, and several other areas. It would be misleading to infer 
that votes on this omnibus measure indicate support or opposition to the IMF since 
other programs were addressed as well. Thus, I restrict the sample to votes that focus 
exclusively on the IMF allocation; "clean" votes that capture legislator positions on the 
IMF and little else. 
This restriction means that some IMF funding increases are not included in the 
analysis, or that clean votes are available for only one chamber of Congress. To help 
address this problem, I extend the sample to include votes on amendments to 
omnibus expenditure bills that specifically target the IMF allocation. Existing 
research shows that congressional voting on amendments is similar to voting on final 
passage, in terms of the influence of political party, personal ideology, and other 
dominant factors (Snyder and Groseclose 2000). I therefore include amendments to 
omnibus bills that exclusively target funding for the IMF. For example, the $108 
billion increase for the NAB in 2009 was bundled into a supplemental appropriations 
bill that included financing for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, among other things, </p>

<p>The IMF conducts general quota reviews about every 5 years. Quota increases comprise an equipropor-
tional percentage increase for all members and a selective increase, which adjusts certain members' quota 
shares in order to align them with their relative economic size. Column 3 is the sum of the 
equiproportional increase and the selective increases. The 1958/59 review was the only review conducted 
outside the 5-year cycle. Data on quota and quota shares are from the IMF's International Financial 
Statistics (IFS) </p>

<p>
as well as for the IMF. However, on May 21, 2009 the Senate voted on an 
amendment that isolated the IMF allocation. The amendment, proposed by right-
wing Jim DeMint (Rep-SC)-an opponent of the IMF increase-would strip IMF 
funding from the supplemental appropriations bill. The amendment failed by a vote 
of 30-64 and the IMF got its money. By voting against the amendment, senators 
indicated they supported extending the IMF an additional $100 billion credit via the 
NAB and supported increasing the U.S. quota by $8 billion. The vote on the DeMint 
amendment is "clean" and therefore included in the analysis. </p>

<p>3 Aggregate Support for the IMF in the House and Senate </p>

<p>I begin the analysis with an aggregate indicator of congressional support for the 
IMF: the size of the margin voting in favor of IMF funding by chamber. When a 
chamber approves IMF funding increases by wide margins, it stands to reason that 
the IMF commands a high level of support in that chamber. By contrast, when 
funding increases are approved by narrow margins-or fail to be approved 
altogether-it signals that the chamber views the IMF less favorably. While factors 
other than legislators' native "support" for the IMF shape the size of these margins-
international crises, conflicting spending priorities, budget conditions, etc.-vote 
margins provide a rough gauge of aggregate congressional support for the IMF, both 
over time and across houses of Congress. 
I expect that the level of aggregate support the IMF enjoys in Congress is 
likely to differ systematically between chambers, due to differences in electoral 
institutions across the chambers. The U.S. has a bicameral legislature consisting 
of an upper house-the Senate-and a lower house-the House of Representatives. 
The 435 members of the House of Representatives serve 2-year terms and 
represent small districts, apportioned by population, while the 100 senators serve 
6-year terms and represent entire states. Existing research suggests that support 
for the IMF should be higher in the Senate than in the House, due to senators' 
larger constituencies. Having large districts means that senators represent 
heterogeneous constituencies; thus, cross-cutting pressures from interests within 
their districts should make them relatively less sensitive to anti-globalization and 
anti-IMF pressures than representatives. This "constituency size" argument is 
commonplace in the literature on trade policy (Baldwin 1985; Rogowski 1987; 
Magee et al. 1989; Keech and Pak 1995; Bailey et al. 1997; Gilligan 1997; Irwin 
and Kroszner 1999). In his classic paper, Rogowski (1987, 208) argues that it is 
"almost self-evident" that large districts offer insulation from particularistic 
pressures and therefore a more internationalist outlook. Similarly, Baldwin 
(1985, 16) asserts that "Since senators generally represent more populous and 
industrially diversified political units than House members, it is less likely that 
the proportion of workers employed in import injured industries will be so high 
that a senator is forced to adopt a protectionist posture." This argument can be 
extended to support for the IMF since the IMF is the international financial 
institution charged with promoting trade and global economic integration. Just as 
the Senate is more free trading than the House, so too should it be more 
supportive of the IMF. </p>

<p>The United States Congress and IMF financing, 1944-2009 </p>

<p>
Figure 1 indicates that the level of support for the IMF is higher in the Senate than 
in the House. The vertical axis displays the share of the chamber voting in favor of 
new appropriations for the IMF; the year the vote occurred is shown on the 
horizontal axis. The figure reveals that aggregate support for the IMF has fallen 
steadily over time in the House but not in the Senate. In 1945, 95% of House 
members registered support for the vote to fund and authorize initial U.S. 
participation in the IMF. By 1998, only 46% of House members could muster 
support for the IMF on the clean vote identified in Table 3. This roll call took place 
on April 23, 1998, during the height of the Asian currency crisis when the IMF was 
desperate to increase its resources to deal with the spreading crisis. But the failure of 
the House to approve this procedural motion-which would have allowed the House 
and Senate to pass identical spending bills and thereby provide the IMF with $18 
billion-stalled the IMF appropriation for another 6 months. The subsequent spread 
of the crisis to Russia and Brazil, along with President Clinton's admonishment of 
congressional foot-dragging as "irresponsible," ultimately helped convince House 
opponents that they would be blamed if a global recession took place (Frankel and 
Roubini 2003, 187). But it was not until October, 1998 that the House finally 
approved the IMF's $18 billion (in an omnibus supplemental spending package), and 
many House conservatives were still deeply skeptical about the funding increase. 
The decline in House support for the IMF may reflect increasing anti-
globalization sentiment during the post-war period. With small districts, representa-
tives may have been more exposed to interest group and constituency pressures 
associated with increasing international economic integration. The IMF is the 
international institution charged with protecting world trade and payments from 
financial distress; it is a natural target for constituencies harmed by deepening global 
economic integration (Woods 2006). 
One conjecture is that support for the IMF was high in the House in the early 
post-war period because few congressional districts faced serious import competition 
at that time. The war's destruction of the capital stock of the other major industrial 
countries and the disintegration of goods markets had left the United States running 
large trade surpluses: from 1945 to 1955, the U.S. trade surplus averaged an 
impressive 1.76% of GDP per year. 
6 By the early 1970s, the boom for the tradables 
sector was over as post-war recovery and rapid economic growth in Europe and 
Japan led to surging imports and the onset of persistent U.S. trade deficits. Since 
1975, the nation imported more goods and services than it exported and the trade 
deficit has averaged −2.05% of GDP between 1975 and 2009. Large trade deficits, 
along with falling transportation costs and reduced barriers to trade, meant that more 
U.S. workers and firms were exposed to foreign competition-both at home and in 
world markets-than before. As a result, anti-globalization pressures intensified and 
were reflected in the House of Representatives (Destler 2005). It's possible that 
opposition to globalization spilled over to the IMF and reduced representatives' 
support for new funding increases. 
Figure 2 provides suggestive evidence. The figure plots the correlation between 
support for the IMF in the House and the U.S. trade balance. The trade balance fits 
the data well (R 
2 =0.72) and the correlation is highly significant (t=4.84). While </p>

<p>6 Trade balance data are from Historical Statistics of the United States (2010). </p>

<p>J.L. Broz </p>

<p>
other factors may correlate with support for the IMF in the House, the trade balance 
seems potentially important. Global competition, as well as import surges caused by 
U.S. macroeconomic policies-e.g., the "strong dollar" policy of the first Reagan 
administration-correlate strongly with the decline in IMF support among 
representatives. 
Aggregate support for the IMF in the Senate, however, does not fit this pattern. 
Figure 1 suggests that support in the upper chamber has been higher than in the 
House for all votes except the first one in 1945. Furthermore, Senate support is 
unrelated to the trade balance: the correlation is positive but not significant (t=1.02, 
P=0.349). 
Greater support for the IMF in the Senate might be expected, given differences in 
electoral institutions. With their statewide constituencies, senators may be more 
insulated from anti-globalization pressures and thereby more able than representa-
tives to take an internationalist outlook on the IMF, as they do on other foreign 
policy issues (Meernik and Oldmixon 2004; Cronin and Fordham 1999). If senators 
represent more populous and industrially diversified political units than House 
members, it is less likely that the proportion of workers and firms that are negatively 
affected by import competition will be so high that a senator is forced to adopt an 
anti-IMF posture. I explore this hypothesis in the micro-level analysis below. 
Note that the "constituency size" argument also extends to the office of the 
president. With a nationwide constituency, presidents have been consistently less 
protectionist than Congresses (Baldwin 1985; Lohmann and O'Halloran 1994; 
Milner and Rosendorff 1996). According to Karol (2007, 486), "Since 1932 all 
presidents have indeed been more supportive of freer trade than the Congresses with 
which they served." Presidents have also consistently supported the IMF more 
strongly than the Congresses with which they served. In fact, every IMF quota 
increase has been supported by the president despite partisan and ideological 
differences across presidents. A good example of this occurred in 1983 when 
aggregate Senate support for IMF funding ebbed to its lowest level (63%). The 
context was the IMF's Eighth General Quota Review, which coincided with the 
Latin American debt crisis. The debt crisis aroused strong ideological divisions in 
Congress over IMF funding (Boughton 2001, 867-70). The Eighth Review quota 
increase proposal was attacked by left-of-center legislators who saw it as a bailout </p>

for commercial banks that had lent imprudently to developing countries. Conversely, 
right-of-center politicians attacked the IMF quota increase as a bailout for indebted 
countries with excessive governmental intervention in their economies (Boughton 
2001, 869). The ideological opposition delayed the appropriation, which led the IMF 
to impose a partial freeze on new lending (Bordo and James 2000, 32). The threat to 
the global banking system and U.S. national interests spurred President Ronald 
Reagan to undertake a strong personal campaign to elicit support for the 
appropriation. Despite his right-wing ideology, Reagan said he had "an unbreakable 
commitment to increased funding for the IMF" and referred to the Fund as the 
"linchpin of the international financial system." Reagan urged Congress to back the 
large quota increase to prevent an "economic nightmare that could plague 
generations to come" (Farnsworth 1983, 1). 
While "ideology" has relatively less influence on presidential support for the IMF, 
it is an important source of congressional attitudes toward the IMF. 
7 As I have 
argued elsewhere, ideology provides legislators with a simple schema for evaluating 
policy towards the IMF, which they tend to know little about (Broz and Hawes 
2006a, b). Nearly all issues and votes in Congress fall along the "left-right" 
dimension epitomized by the role of government in the economy (Poole and 
Rosenthal 1997). Funding the IMF is no different (Locke 2000). Right-wing 
politicians that believe in a small role for government in the domestic economy 
oppose the IMF because they think IMF programs distort economic incentives in the 
global economy. They view IMF programs as "bailouts" that insulate investors and 
borrowers from the risks of their actions and thereby promote greater instability in 
international finance. The right also opposes expansion of the government sector and 
they see international organizations like the IMF as particularly prone to waste and 
inefficiency. 
8 Conversely, the left focuses on market failures at both the domestic 
and the international levels and sees a positive role for IFIs in mitigating the 
economic and social costs of financial and development crises. The left also tends to 
be more optimistic about the operations of international organizations, and the 
motivations of the officials that inhabit them. 
9 In short, ideology provides the 
foundation upon which legislators evaluate the IMF. 
The ideological divide on the IMF widened in 1983 when the Latin American 
debt crisis starkly illustrated the moral hazard problem (Smith 1984). It became 
wider still during the Asian currency crises when the Clinton administration 
approached Congress for increasing the resources of the IMF by $18 billion (Locke 
2000). By that point, the proposal was immediately and forcefully opposed by 
House conservatives. After a long battle, the final appropriations bill passed with a 
proviso that a special bipartisan commission be established to consider the future of 
the IMF and the other international financial institutions. The Meltzer Commission, </p>

<p>7 While both Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush were initially susceptible to right-wing arguments 
against the IMF, once in office, they both supported new IMF funding proposals. See Smith (1984) and 
Babb (2008).

named for its chair, economics professor Allan Meltzer, produced a report in 
November 1998 that encapsulates the tension between the right-wing and the left-
wing views of the IMF. 
10 While the right-wing majority on the commission 
emphasized how IMF programs created a moral hazard for international banks and 
borrowing countries alike, left-wing dissenters argued that the IMF has a necessary 
and important place in the world economy, due to market failures in international 
finance. 
Spatial scaling techniques developed by Poole and Rosenthal (1997) are well 
established tools for estimating the ideological positions of legislators and 
legislatures over time (Poole 2005). The DW-NOMINATE methodology yields 
estimates of each member's ideal point in each Congress and allows the estimated 
locations to be compared across Congresses. Previous research has demonstrated 
that the first dimension of DW-NOMINATE locations reveal standard left-right 
cleavages (Poole and Rosenthal 2007). 
11 To investigate whether "ideology" might 
help explain why the Senate tends to be more supportive of the IMF than the House, 
Figure 3 plots the average value of the first dimension DW-NOMINATE for each 
house of Congress from the 79th Congress (1945-46) to the 110th Congress (2007-
08). I am interested in the difference in the average ideology of the Senate and the 
House because, if ideology accounts for the higher level of support for the IMF in 
the upper chamber, then the Senate should be systematically more left-wing than the 
House. The figure does not support this conjecture as there is no clear left-wing bias 
in the Senate. A comparison of means test confirms that the small difference (0.004) </p>

<p>10 See also Meltzer (2011). 
11 Because Poole and Rosenthal construct their estimates using only roll call data, DW-NOMINATE 
conflates two sources of legislator ideology: constituency characteristics and the personal beliefs of 
members. Constituents shape legislator ideology by electing members with similar beliefs-right-wing 
electorates tend to elect legislators who occupy right-wing positions in the NOMINATE space. Thus, DW-
NOMINATE incorporates both constituency and personal ideological beliefs. See Fleck and Kilby (2002) 
and Fordham and McKeown (2003). </p>

is not statistically significant (t=0.653). Average ideology does not appear to explain 
why the Senate is more supportive of the IMF than the House. 
This preliminary investigation has revealed that average support for the IMF is 
higher in the Senate than in the House, and that House support has declined in 
correlation with the trade balance. While there is little evidence that ideological 
differences across chambers "explain" these intercameral differences, we cannot rule 
out the possibility that electoral institutions are at work. The evidence presented is 
consistent with the "constituency size" argument: with larger and more heteroge-
neous constituencies, senators are inclined to take a more internationalist (pro-IMF) 
outlook than representatives. With large populations, states encompass a wider 
variety of groups and interests than do congressional districts (which are sometimes 
gerrymandered to produce a single interest or dominant partisan predisposition). Due 
to their diverse and cross-cutting constituencies, senators might also be more 
insulated from the parochial pressures that representatives face during periods of 
high import penetration. 
The aggregate evidence is merely suggestive. To evaluate these claims with 
greater rigor, I move to the micro-analysis of legislator voting behavior. </p>

<p>4 Micro-level Analysis of Legislator Support for the IMF </p>

<p>In this section, I analyze the individual voting decisions of senators and 
representatives on the sample of "clean" IMF funding bills to come before Congress 
since 1944. The aim is to build on the arguments and conclusions from the previous 
section, which can be restated at the micro-level: </p>

<p>1. The more left-wing the ideology of the individual legislator, the more likely the 
legislator is to vote in support of a new appropriation for the IMF. 
2. Controlling for ideology and party affiliation, senators are more likely than 
representatives to vote for a new IMF appropriation due to their larger 
constituencies. 
3. Representatives are more sensitive to constituency pressures than senators on 
matters relating to IMF financing. </p>

<p>The first argument reflects the fact that ideology structures almost all roll-call 
voting in Congress (Poole and Rosenthal 1997), including votes on the IMF (Broz 
and Hawes 2006a, b). The second hypothesis captures the argument that 
intercameral differences in the size of constituencies give senators a more 
internationalist outlook on IMF policy than representatives. The third hypothesis 
tests the claim that, due to their smaller districts, House members are more 
susceptible to pressures from constituents and special interests that are affected, 
directly or indirectly, by the IMF's international financial activities. 
With respect to interest groups that are directly affected by the IMF's activities, I 
focus on "money center" banks. Money center banks are the nation's largest global 
banks. They engage in international finance and have a heavy involvement in 
wholesale banking with clients comprising many retail banks and global corpo-
rations. Citigroup, J. P. Morgan Chase, and Bank of America fit this description. </p>

<p>J.L. Broz </p>

<p>
Money center banks comprise a key constituency for the IMF. On the one hand, IMF 
financial rescues provide de facto insurance to these banks, allowing them to retain 
the gains from international lending while distributing losses, when they occur, to 
the public sector. IMF rescues are a form of insurance to these private creditors, and 
thus a source of moral hazard (Bulow and Rogoff 1990; Rogoff 1999). Indeed, Bird 
(1996) finds that the financial assistance the Fund provides to debtor countries is 
often used to repay loans to commercial banks. In some instances, debt service is an 
explicit component of IMF programs (Gould 2003). 
12 Demirguc-Kunt and Huizinga 
(1993) also find general evidence of the benefits moral hazard provides to banks by 
showing that unanticipated increases in U.S. financial commitments to the IMF 
cause the stock market capitalization of the exposed banks to increase. On the other 
hand, the operations of the IMF expand international opportunities for money center 
banks and promote policies in developing countries that are conducive to debt 
repayment. Thus, I expect campaign contributions from money center banks to have 
a positive impact on the propensity of representatives to vote in favor of increasing 
U.S. contributions to the IMF. 
With respect to constituents that are indirectly affected by the IMF's activities, 
I expect House members representing districts with greater proportions of net 
"losers" from economic globalization to be more likely to oppose increasing the 
IMF's resources. This is because the IMF, by pursuing its mandate to promote 
the expansion, integration, and stability of the global economy, encourages 
globalization and its attendant domestic distributional consequences (Woods 
2006; Moser and Sturm 2011). 
Two models from trade theory identify the losers and winners of the IMF's 
pro-globalization policies: the Ricardo-Viner model and the Stolper-Samuelson 
model. My extension to IMF funding recognizes that the IMF's mandate to 
protect the world economy from financial disorder is a benefit to constituencies 
that gain from global economic integration and a cost to groups that suffer. From 
the Ricardo-Viner perspective, I thus expect House members with higher shares 
of constituents employed in export industries to be more receptive to IMF 
funding increases than members with large numbers of workers employed in 
import-competing industries. From the Stolper-Samuelson perspective, I expect 
members representing districts with greater proportions of high-skilled workers to 
support IFI funding increases, while representatives with greater shares of low-
skilled workers in their districts will oppose these appropriations. </p>

<p>4.1 Data, Models, and Results </p>

<p>The dependent variable in the following regressions is the legislator's vote on IMF 
funding increases. The roll-calls included in these analyzes are listed in Table 3. 
Votes are coded 1="support" for the IMF funding increase, and 0=opposition to the 
appropriation. 
13 The data are in panel format with the legislator-vote as the unit of </p>

<p>12 Oatley and Yackee (2004) find that countries in which U.S. money center banks are more heavily 
exposed are more likely to receive support from the IMF, controlling for other correlates. 
13 On the four roll calls where a "nay" vote supports the IMF appropriation, "nay"=1 and "yea"=0 (roll 
calls #341, #125, #149, #201). </p>

<p>
analysis. The panel specification means that I am combining roll-call votes within 
and across congressional sessions, which allows for a simple and compact analysis 
of the data. I estimate probit models with robust standard errors clustered by 
legislator, to deal with across-observation relationships in the error term. I include 
roll-call fixed effects to control for any unmodeled heterogeneity across votes and 
differences in the yea-nay margin over time. 
Table 4 presents results related to my first two arguments. Hypothesis 1 is that 
legislators with more left-wing ideologies will be more likely to support IMF 
funding increases. I evaluate this argument using the first dimension of a legislator's 
DW-NOMINATE score as a proxy for "ideology." DW-NOMINATE estimates range 
from −1 to +1 (from most left-wing to most right-wing) and are available for all 
legislators in my sample of IMF financing roll-call votes (1945-2009). Given how 
closely the Poole-Rosenthal scores are related to political partisanship, I estimate the 
effect of DW-NOMINATE separately for each party. I also control for 
PRESIDENT'S PARTY, which is a binary variable equal to 1 if the legislator is a 
member of the same political party as the current president. I include this control 
because ideology may correlate with being of the same party as the president, which 
would predispose legislators to support the IMF if presidents exert executive 
influence on co-partisans (presidents have uniformly supported IMF funding bills 
when they come before Congress). 
In Models 4.1 and 4.2, the negative and highly significant estimates for DW-
NOMINATE suggest that right-wing legislators are more likely to oppose financing 
the IMF than left-wing legislators. This holds for both Democrats (Model 4.1) and 
Republicans (Model 4.2), even taking into account whether a legislator is a member 
of the same political party as the president. Sharing the president's party affiliation 
also matters, as both Democrats and Republicans are more likely to approve new </p>

money for the IMF when they belong to the same party as the president, but personal 
ideology affects voting behavior independent of this relationship. </p>

<p>14 </p>

<p>To test Hypothesis 2, that legislators from the upper house are more supportive of the 
IMF, Models 4.3 and 4.4 adds the binary variable, SENATE, to the regressions. The 
coefficient estimate is positive and highly significant for both Democrats (Model 4.3) 
and Republicans (Model 4.4), controlling for individual ideology and party ties to the 
president. Model 4.5 pools Democrats and Republicans and includes roll-call vote fixed 
effects (not shown) to deal with unmodeled heterogeneity across votes and over time. 
The estimates for DW-NOMINATE and SENATE remain highly statistically significant 
(z=−23.13, z=6.20 respectively) in the proper direction. 
Figure 4 provides a substantive interpretation of these probit results and a sense of 
the magnitude of the effects. I simulated the predicted probability of observing a vote in 
favor of increasing the IMF's resources, and then examined how the predicted 
probabilities change as the explanatory variables increase one standard deviation from 
their means, holding other variables at their mean values (binary variables are set to 
zero). 
15 I estimate these effects for members of each party using Model 4.3 and Model 
4.4. The impact of ideology is substantively large and very precisely estimated for 
both Democrats and Republicans: a one standard deviation increase in DW-
NOMINATE above the party mean-a move to the right-reduces the likelihood of 
a Democratic legislator supporting the IMF by 24 percentage points. A similar move 
reduces the chance that a Republican legislator will support the IMF by 31 percentage 
points. The effect of being in the Senate is also large: a Democratic senator is 10 
percentage points more likely than a Democratic representative to support the IMF, 
and a Republican senator is 17 percentage points more likely than a Republican 
representative to support the IMF. These effects are large, even in comparison with the 
effect of being in the same party as the president. Sharing the party affiliation of the 
president increases the likelihood of voting more funds to the IMF by 13 percentage 
points for Democrats and 5 percentage points for Republicans. 
To further explore Hypothesis 2, I take advantage of a "natural experiment" 
derived from apportionment procedures that give certain senators and representatives 
identically sized and equally heterogeneous constituencies. 
16 Due to their small 
populations, some states are apportioned only one legislator to the lower house and 
these "representatives-at-large" are elected by the entire state. 
17 Since senators from 
these small states are elected by the same constituency, a comparison of the votes 
cast on the IMF by representatives-at-large and senators from the same states allows 
for a direct test of the argument that members of the Senate are more pro-IMF than 
members of the House due to their larger constituencies. If it is the size of 
constituencies that matters, then voting by representatives-at-large and senators from 
the same states should be similar, controlling for legislators' personal characteristics, </p>

<p>14 As DW-NOMINATE is constructed solely from roll call data, it incorporates both member beliefs and 
the ideological positions of constituents that elect members into Congress. See Fleck and Kilby (2002).

16 See Karol (2007) for an application of this experiment to trade policy voting. 
17 The number of states with a representative-at-large has changed over time due to population and 
migration shifts. For the votes in my sample, the states with a single representative include Alaska (1959-
2009), Delaware (1945-2009), Hawaii (1959), Montana (1991-2009), Nevada (1945-1978), North 
Dakota (1970-2009), South Dakota (1980-2009), Vermont (1945-2009), and Wyoming (1945-2009). </p>

since they have identical constituencies. But if there is some unmodeled reason other 
than constituency size that accounts for why senators support the IMF more than 
Representatives, then voting by senators and representatives-at-large will be 
significantly different. 
Table 5 presents the results of this experiment. Model 6.1 is the baseline model. 
Model 6.2 adds REP-AT-LARGE and SENATE * REP-AT-LARGE, the interaction of 
the Senate dummy and the binary variable indicating whether a member is from a state 
with only one representative. The interaction term picks up the cases where senators and 
representatives have exactly the same constituencies-it is a formal test of the hypothesis 
that constituency size explains the Senate-House gap in support for the IMF. Notice that 
the SENATE point estimate is virtually identical across Models 6.1 and 6.2 while the 
estimate for the interaction term SENATE * REP-AT-LARGE is not significantly 
different than zero. 
18 This means we cannot reject Hypothesis 2: the Senate-House gap 
in support for the IMF is the same for representatives-at-large and other cases, ceteris 
paribus. Put another way, legislators serving in the Senate are no more pro-IMF than 
legislators in the House when they have identical constituencies. 
Model 6.3 moves away from the experiment to assess whether senators' length of 
tenure affects their voting behavior. Controlling for tenure length is important because 
senators may be more supportive of the IMF because they serve longer terms than 
representatives, rather than because they have larger constituencies. I assess this 
alternative institutional argument via variation among senators with respect to TIME TO 
ELECTION. This variable measures the number of years between an IMF roll-call vote 
and a senator's next election. It ranges from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating that a senator is up 
for reelection later in the same year as the roll-call vote, and 5 indicates that the senator 
has 5 years remaining until her next election. 
19 The evidence from Model 6.3 supports 
the "larger constituency" hypothesis: the point estimate for TIME TO ELECTION is </p>

<p>18 Interpreting interaction terms in non-linear models is not straightforward. For example, the direction 
and significance of the effect may be different for different observations (Ai and Norton 2003). Using the 
inteff command in <rs type="software">STATA</rs>, I calculated the interaction effect correctly (Norton et al. 2004). This revealed 
that the interaction term SENATE * REP-AT-LARGE is not statistically significant at any level but 
positive for all observations. 
19 Senators are divided into three classes for purposes of elections and every 2 years the members of one 
class-approximately one-third of the Senate-face election or reelection. Data on the class and election 
dates of senators are from Swift et al., Database of Congressional Historical Statistics. </p>

positive but not statistically significant. For senators, the length of time between 
elections is not statistically related to voting on the IMF, which supports the hypothesis 
that the Senate-House difference in support for the IMF is due to constituency 
differences. 
Overall, the inference is that constituency differences are the root cause of the 
pro-IMF bias in the Senate. In states where representatives and senators share the 
same constituency, they tend to vote similarly on IMF funding. In all other states, 
senators have larger and more diverse constituencies than representatives and are 
more supportive of the IMF because of the difference in constituency size. 
My third hypothesis is that representatives are more susceptible than senators 
to interest group and constituency pressures. I argue that the IMF tends to 
provoke two types of societal pressures that bear especially on representatives 
(due to their smaller districts): pressures from groups that are harmed or 
benefited from globalization-which the IMF promotes-and pressures and 
rewards from money center banks that gain directly from IMF activities. I proxy 
legislator affinity to money center banks by the amount of campaign 
contributions members receive from these banks. To identify money center 
banks, I use the regulatory classification in the Federal Financial Institutions 
Examination Council's (FFIEC) "Country Exposure Lending Survey." Because 
the FFIEC identifies the specific banks that comprise the money center group, I 
was able to obtain a list on which to base the collection of campaign contribution 
data (see the Data Appendix for the banks that make up this group). For campaign 
contributions, I use the Federal Election Commission's data on contributions from 
Political Action Committees (PACs). My constructed variable is BANK CON-
TRIBUTIONS: the sum total of money center bank contributions to each legislator </p>

in the previous electoral cycle. The value of contributions is divided by 1,000 for 
ease of interpretation. 
I also expect representatives to be sensitive to the indirect effects of globalization on 
their districts: the larger the share of voters in a district that benefit (lose) from global 
economic integration, the more likely a member will be to support (oppose) the IMF. 
The winners (losers) can be defined by industry, following Ricardo-Viner reasoning, or 
by skill level following Stolper-Samuelson. Either operationalization captures my 
argument that legislators understand that the IMF promotes globalization, and take 
positions that reflect the impact of globalization on the real incomes of their constituents. 
My proxies for the Ricardo-Viner effect are NET IMPORTS and NET 
EXPORTS. NET IMPORTS is the percentage of district workers employed in 
manufacturing industries where the ratio of imports to consumption is greater 
that the ratio of revenues from exports to total industry revenue. NET EXPORTS 
is the percentage of workers in sectors where the ratio of revenues from exports 
to total industry revenue is greater than the ratio of imports to consumption (see 
the Data Appendix for more details). To tap agricultural trade, I use AG 
PRODUCTION, which is the total value of agricultural output (crops and 
livestock) by district/state.

<p>
output should be more supportive of the IMF since those districts are likely to be 
net exporters of farm products. To model Stolper-Samuelson effects, in which I 
posit a positive relationship between constituent skill levels and legislator support 
for the IFIs, I use HIGH SKILLS, which is the share of state or district population 
aged 16 and above employed in executive, administrative, managerial, and 
professional specialty occupations. However, since high skills might correlate 
with wealth or education which could lead constituents to favor the IMF, I include 
a control of district/state household MEDIAN INCOME. 
Due to data availability limitations, I can only test these pressure group models 
back to 1980 for the House and 1991 for the Senate. Table 6 presents estimates with 
votes pooled by chamber. The results largely confirm the inference that 
representatives will be more susceptible to interest group and constituency pressures 
than senators. In Model 7.1 (House votes) and Model 7.3 (Senate votes), I do not 
control for DW-NOMINATE and PRESIDENT'S PARTY. This is because member 
ideology and party affiliation are, to some extent, indirect reflections of constituency 
interests: voters elect legislators whose ideology and political party suggest they will 
vote in accordance with constituents' interests (Fleck and Kilby 2002; Fordham and 
McKeown 2003). To the extent that legislator ideology and partisanship influence 
voting in a way that is not determined by constituency interests via elections, those 
elements of DW-NOMINATE and PRESIDENT'S PARTY are uncorrelated with </p>

constituency interests and omitting them won't cause omitted variable bias. 
21 The 
coefficients on my other constituency variables will thus reflect the full influence of 
constituents: both electing and lobbying legislators. Nevertheless, in Models 7.2 and 
7.4, I include DW-NOMINATE and PRESIDENT'S PARTY as controls for 
comparison. In these models, the direct (lobbying) and indirect (electing) channels 
through which constituents influence legislator voting are included, but it is 
impossible to attribute indirect influence properly. 
Comparing across Models 7.1 and 7.3 provides evidence that the House and 
Senate differ in terms of sensitivity to societal pressures. In Model 7.1 (House 
votes), all constituency and special interest coefficients are statistically significant 
and correctly signed, with the exception of AG PRODUCTION, which is significant 
but negatively signed. Farm interests should support the IMF since a large share of 
the agricultural land in the United States is devoted to grain production for export 
markets and the IMF's mission is to promote trade. The negative estimate may be 
due to the fact that AG PRODUCTION is correlated with legislator ideology: 
farming regions in the U.S. tend to elect legislators. Indeed, in Model 7.2, which 
controls for ideology with DW-NOMINATE, the sign flips and AG PRODUCTION 
is positively signed, as expected, and significant. 
All other point estimates in Model 7.1 support Hypothesis 3. Receiving more 
campaign contributions from money center banks (BANK CONTRIBUTIONS), and 
having more skilled workers a district (SKILLS), correlate positively and 
significantly with a House member voting in support of the IMF. 
22 Members 
representing districts with larger shares of workers employed in import industries 
(NET IMPORTS) are less likely to vote new funding for the IMF, while members 
with more workers in net export industries (NET EXPORTS) are more likely to 
support the IMF. 
23 As a group, the first five (constituency) variables in Model 7.1 
are jointly significant at the 0.0001 level. Model 7.2, which controls for legislator 
ideology and partisanship, does little to alter the inference that voting in the House 
on the IMF is correlated with constituent characteristics and interest group pressures. 
The joint significance of the five constituency variables in Model 2 is very highly 
significant (P=0.0000). By contrast, none of these coefficient estimates are 
significant, either independently or jointly, in Model 7.3 or Model 7.4, which pool 
votes from the Senate. While House members are sensitive to constituency 
influences, senators appear to be insulated from these forces. 
As a final test, I consider whether heterogeneity within states bears on IMF 
voting in the Senate. 
24 Bailey and Brady (1998) argue that constituent pressures 
are more likely to influence the votes of senators when states are relatively 
homogenous in terms of voter preferences. The intuition is that homogeneity of 
voter preferences simplifies legislators' electoral coalition-building problem 
sufficiently that they take positions on salient issues that are responsive to voter </p>

<p>21 I thank Christopher Kilby for this suggestion. 
22 This does not necessarily indicate that bank contributions cause members to change their votes. The 
positive correlation might simply mean that banks give money to representatives that share their policy 
views. 
23 Testing both Stolper-Samuelson and Ricardo Viner effects in the same model may not be technically 
correct (Imai and Tingley 2011; Ladewig 2006), but I do so here to ease comparison with previous work. 
24 I thank a reviewer for suggesting this test. </p>

<p>
preferences. By contrast, when voter preferences within a state are heterogeneous, 
senators are less responsive to constituents and more apt to vote on the basis of 
ideology and party-specific coalitions. Since this is a very different mechanism 
than the one I posit, I need to confirm that the Senate is less responsive to 
constituency interests due to senators' larger districts. To do so, I re-estimate 
Model 7.5 on a sample restricted to the 25 states that Bailey and Brady (1998) </p>

determine to be homogenous. 
25 As none of the constituency and interest group 
point estimates are statistically significant in this sample, we can reject the 
alternative hypothesis that the mechanism insulating senators from constituency 
pressures is the underlying homogeneity of states. 
Figure 5 plots the substantive effects of constituency and interest group effects by 
chamber from Models 7.1 and 7.3. For the House, my estimates suggest that a one 
standard deviation increase in BANK CONTRIBUTIONS above its mean increases 
the likelihood that a representative will support the IMF by 4 percentage points. </p>

<p>26 </p>

<p>The same effect holds for House members when SKILL LEVEL and NET 
EXPORTS are increased by a standard deviation, but the later is more precisely 
estimated. Increasing the share of House district employment in the NET IMPORT 
sector reduces the likelihood that a representative will support the IMF by 3 
percentage points. But in the Senate, the effects of changing BANK CONTRIBU-
TIONS, SKILL LEVEL, NET EXPORTS, and NET IMPORTS are never 
statistically different than zero. Overall, representatives appear to be more responsive 
to constituent interests and pressure group lobbying than senators. </p>

<p>5 Conclusion </p>

<p>When Congress ratified United States participation in the IMF in 1944, it retained 
permanent authority over increases in U.S. financial commitments to this 
international organization. I have analyzed roll-call voting on IMF funding increases 
as if it is a historical record of "support" for the IMF within the United States. I 
found that support for the IMF is generally higher in the Senate than in the House 
due to differences in electoral rules between the chambers. Large districts-as 
opposed to long tenures-appear to make the Senate the more "internationalist" 
chamber on IMF policy and insulate senators from constituent and interest group 
pressures. I also found that ideology is an important source of congressional voting 
decisions on the IMF, with right-leaning legislators more likely to vote against new 
IMF funding than left-wing legislators. While politicians on the right tend to view 
the IMF as a profligate bureaucracy that distorts incentives in international financial 
markets, left-wing legislators view the IMF more favorably because they think 
international financial markets are prone to crises and need a crisis manager. </p>

<p>27 </p>

<p>25 Bailey and Brady (1998) construct an index of state heterogeneity from six social, economic, and 
religious variables: education, income, occupation, housing ownership, ethnic stock, and religion. Using 
this index, they rank states from the most to the least heterogeneous: NY, NJ, MA, CA, CT, HI, RI, IL, 
LA, FL, NM, PA, WI, NH, TX, VT, ND, AZ, MD, MI, MN, DE, NV, OH, CO, ME, WA, NE, MO, AK, 
SD, MT, OR, IA, KS, VA, IN, WY, KY, GA, ID, UT, OK, MS, AL, SC, TN, WV, NC, AR. The 25 states 
ranked below Colorado are coded as "homogeneous." 
26 Endogeneity is a concern here as banks may give contributions to representatives that already share 
their policy positions rather than to "buy their votes." However, Broz (2008) performs a difference-in-
difference test to establish that causality runs from bank contributions to IMF voting, as opposed to the 
other way around. 
27 To quote right-wing conservative Newt Gingrich, the 1998 IMF quota increase was "typical liberal 
foreign policy…we're not turning over $18 billion to a French Socialist [Michel Camdessus] to throw it 
away." Camdessus was Managing Director of the IMF at the time. Speech before the Christian Coalition, 
September 18, 1998, Washington, DC. Cited in the New York Times, September 25, 1998. </p>

<p>
An implication of both findings is that an aggregate shift to the right in U.S. 
politics poses significant problems for the IMF and its supporters, especially in the 
House of Representatives. Since the early 1990s, the House has moved substantially 
to the right and this has led IMF supporters to innovate strategies to secure approval 
of new funding. One strategy has been to package IMF funding with other spending 
projects that right-wing legislators are loathe to oppose (Babb 2009). But there are 
limits to the effectiveness of this approach: opponents on the right can try to build 
majorities for amendments to strip the IMF allocation from these engineered bills. 
They can also call the bluff and vote against the strategically constructed bill, albeit 
at a cost. 
A case in point occurred when President Obama was trying to get approval for the 
$100 billion line of credit to the IMF to meet the commitment he made at the April 
2009 meeting of the G20. Supporters in the Senate attached the IMF money to a 
supplemental war spending bill after the House had already passed its war spending 
bill without IMF funds. Since normal procedure is for the two chambers to reconcile 
their differences and present an identical bill, the plan was to conjoin IMF funding 
with "funding the troops" so that right-wing House members would be more inclined 
to support it. 
The strategy faced its first hurdle when House Republicans, who had supplied 
168 votes for the war spending in the House, said they would vote against the war 
supplemental en masse unless the IMF money was put to a separate vote. But the 
joint IMF-war supplemental bill moved forward after the Senate voted overwhelming 
against an amendment to strike the IMF allocation; as I have shown, the Senate is a safe 
haven for the IMF. As the bill moved forward, the White House and the Democratic 
leadership, lead by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), went into high gear </p>

threatening and offering deals to 51 anti-war Democrats that had opposed the war funds 
the first time around. The pressure worked and the bill squeaked through by a 
vote of 226-208, with 32 Democrats joining all but five Republicans in voting 
no. Throughout the drama, there were serious doubts that the strategy would 
work (Allen 2009). 
It is no surprise that the House is the locus of anti-IMF sentiment in the United 
States. I have shown that institutional factors help explain why IMF support varies 
by chamber, with the Senate substantially more supportive than the House. Due to 
their large, state-wide constituencies, senators are more apt to support the IMF's 
"internationalism," even as increasing globalization brings dislocations to some 
workers and industries and benefits to others. </p>

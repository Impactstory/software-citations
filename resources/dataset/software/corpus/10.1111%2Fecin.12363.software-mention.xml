<p>This article revisits the sectoral shifts hypothesis by examining unemployment 
fluctuations for 48 U.S. states over the period 1990:M01-2011:M12. We develop a 
panel approach that incorporates dynamics, parameter heterogeneity, aggregate factors, 
and cross-sectional dependence (CSD). Our findings provide support for a positive and 
significant effect of the employment dispersion index on unemployment. This outcome 
is robust under alternative specifications and measures of employment dispersion. The 
empirical evidence corroborates the presence and relevance of CSD and heterogeneity 
among states. The results show that, once unobserved common factors and cross-state 
heterogeneity are taken into account, labor reallocation has a significant effect on 
unemployment that is half the size of the estimate when cross-sectional dependence is 
not taken into account. (JEL E24, E32, J21, R23, C23) </p>

2010; Estevão and Tsounta 2011). In a recent

<p>ECONOMIC INQUIRY </p>

<p>been developing along several dimensions and a 
variety of econometric methodologies. Follow-
ing the pioneering efforts of Blanchard and Katz 
(1992), Medoff (1983), and Neumann and Topel 
(1991), we bring together both the sectoral and 
regional dimensions of intersectoral reallocations 
and explore the impact of a purged measure of 
labor reallocation on unemployment using an 
extensive panel dataset for the United States 
spanning more than two decades. 
Panel data analyses in the field of sectoral 
shifts have mostly relied on fixed effects (FE) 
estimators and have neglected recent advances 
in panel data econometrics (see Gallipoli and 
Pelloni 2008, 2013, Section 5 and in particular 
Table 2). This oversight is a startling omission 
given the importance of heterogeneity, spillover 
effects, and common factors in the analysis of 
the macroeconomic effects of labor reallocation 
for the U.S. states. It is the purpose of this paper 
to re-examine this state of the art by extending 
previous research in three directions. First, we 
employ up-to-date dynamic panel data tech-
niques. The relevant novel aspects of this article 
include recent developments in panel data econo-
metrics concerning dynamics, heterogeneity, and 
cross-sectional dependence (CSD) which, to 
the best of our knowledge, have never been 
applied before in this field and certainly not in 
this context. Second, we have built an extensive 
dataset for U.S. states. The size of our panel 
dataset alleviates the problem of degrees of free-
dom which impaired previous studies. Finally, 
since in recent years most sectoral panel studies 
have focused on wages, our approach refocuses 
on the unemployment, as in the early analy-
ses of Neumann and Topel (1991) and Parker 
(1992). Our model specification is akin to that 
used by Mills, Pelloni, and Zervoyianni (1995) 
and employs a purged Lilien's type dispersion 
measure instead of Neumann and Topel's proxy. 
The remainder of the article is organized 
as follows. Section II discusses the paper 
background and motivation. Section III pro-
vides the econometric model and estimation 
methodology. Section IV presents the data 
and provides a preliminary data analysis. 
Section V reports the empirical results and 
Section VI concludes. </p>

<p>II. LABOR REALLOCATION AND REGIONS </p>

<p>A perpetual reallocation of jobs and workers 
lies beneath labor market activities while an </p>

<p>economy is growing. 1 Though much reallocation 
may take place within each individual sector, it 
is also true that declining sectors are destroy-
ing more jobs than they are creating while the 
opposite is happening in expanding sectors. 
Differences in job creation and destruction 
within sectors imply intersectoral movements of 
workers. 2 The Sectoral Shifts Hypothesis (SSH) 
claims that workers move from declining sectors 
to expanding sectors and that such an activity 
requires time and entails a temporary increase in 
unemployment (Lilien 1982, for surveys of the 
literature see Gallipoli and Pelloni 2008, 2013). 3 
The SSH has been often analyzed by looking 
at the reallocation of workers across sectors at 
country level. Some researchers (Medoff 1983; 
Neumann and Topel 1984, 1991) investigated 
the regional component instead of focusing only 
on the aggregate level. This analytical extension 
provides a more accurate and informative view 
of the phenomenon and its underlying dynamics. 
Draghi (2014) reminds us that aggregation can 
conceal the heterogeneity that exists in the data. 
Taking into account the regional dimension 
alongside the sectoral one allows us to observe 
how changes in the industrial composition of 
labor demand affect different regions, how these 
local effects are interrelated, and how they could 
reverberate at national level. 
If Lilien (1982) led the revival of the SSH 
and the reallocation hypothesis (RH), 4 Medoff 
(1983) steered their courses towards the regional 
dimension. He analyzed differences in labor mar-
ket imbalances in the North-East-Atlantic and 
South-West-Pacific U.S. states. Using alternative 
definitions of the Beveridge curve (the relation-
ship between unemployment and vacancies) and </p>

<p>1. Unemployment is an essential feature in the process 
of creative destruction and growth. Schumpeter (1976, ch. 
7) advanced the notion of creative destruction which was 
developed in its contemporary form by Aghion and Howitt 
(1992). The reallocation underlying labor market workings 
has been pioneered by Davis and Haltiwanger (1992), see also 
Davis, Faberman, and Haltiwanger (2006, 2012)) who have 
been building on an early contribution by Lilien (1982). 
2. Furthermore, existing evidence (Abowd, Corbel, and 
Kramarz 1999; Burgess, Lane, and Stevens 2000; Hamer-
mesh, Hassink, and van Ours 1996) suggests that worker 
turnover (hiring plus separation) is about two to three times 
the size of job reallocations (creations plus destructions). 
3. It could also involve an increase in long-term unem-
ployment if a sufficiently large share of "movers" will not be 
able to find employment in the expanding sectors for lack of 
skills or other reasons. 
4. Davis (1987) points out that Ricardo (1891, ch. 19) 
was already aware of the intuition behind the RH. In this 
perspective, Lilien's contribution has been leading a revival. </p>

<p>a battery of reduced form equations, he could 
relate Beveridge curve(s) shifts to the changing 
labor conditions across areas for the pre-and 
post-1973 periods. Medoff's evidence favors 
labor market imbalances across time and regions 
and suggests a high structural unemployment. 
Inevitably, the analytical framework reflects the 
state of econometrics of its time and has been 
superseded since then. Nevertheless, Medoff's 
work has brought to the fore the importance of 
regional productive structure and its potential 
impact vis-à-vis large economic restructuring. 
Neumann and Topel (1984, 1991) brought the 
analysis a step forward and explored simultane-
ously the geographical and sectoral dimensions 
using a panel data approach. They tested whether 
demand uncertainty, diversification, and sectoral 
shifts are important determinants of equilibrium 
unemployment differentials among labor mar-
kets for the period 1948-1981. Neumann and 
Topel estimated alternative specifications of their 
benchmark model pooled across states and over 
time using FE estimators (as dictated by the 
then prevailing state of the art). The emerging 
outcomes bear out that regional differences in 
unemployment are quite large and persistent over 
time. Permanent sectoral demand shifts are sig-
nificant determinants of unemployment, but their 
impact is modest relative to the typical unemploy-
ment fluctuations. 
The regional analysis of Neumann and Topel 
(1984, 1991), contrary to Medoff (1983), cannot 
fully corroborate the relevance of sectoral shifts. 
Two factors may affect negatively Neumann and 
Topel's analysis. First, their dispersion index 
may belittle the role of allocative shocks (Shaw 
1989). Second, because of the FE estimator, 
their outcomes could be subject to a significant 
bias, occurring when parameter heterogeneity 
and cross-section dependence are ignored. While 
the robustness of their dispersion index could 
be tested using different measures of dispersion, 
the second problem was untreatable at the time 
of Neumann and Topel's article publication as 
it involved developments in econometrics not 
yet available. 
Parker (1992) studied the unemployment 
effects of sectoral shifts by controlling for 
several market distortions and changes in the 
demographic composition of the labor force. 
By examining the relative explanatory power 
of alternative measures of intersectoral and 
interregional dispersion indexes, he could bear 
out the significant impact of both interindus-
try and geographical employment shifts on </p>

<p>unemployment. These effects are magnified 
when sectors and regions are broadly defined. 
Subsequent panel data analyses in this field 
have mostly focused on the sectoral and not 
the regional dimension, and have also been 
more concerned with wage differentials than 
unemployment changes. Methodologically, 
they are restricted to FE estimators (Keane 
1991; Keane and Prasad 1996; Shaw 1989). 
Recently at regional level, the FE approach of 
Estevão and Tsounta (2011) corroborates the 
links between state-level unemployment rates 
changes, skill mismatches, and the housing 
market performance (even after controlling for 
cyclical effects). 
De Serres, Scarpetta, and De La Maison-
neuve (2002) upgraded the sectoral panel data 
methodology. They study the share of wages 
in the total income for five European countries 
and the United States using pooled time series 
and cross-section data and imposing partial het-
erogeneity by means of the Pesaran, Shin, and 
Smith's (1999) pooled mean group (PMG) esti-
mator. Short-run coefficients could differ across 
groups, but at the same time the long-run coeffi-
cients are constrained to be identical. The authors 
conclude that the persistent trend decline in the 
aggregate real wage share in the 1980s and 
1990s is not necessarily only the effect of a per-
vasive wage moderation but could also reflect 
changes in sectoral composition. Besides the 
wages focus, the methodological improvement is 
limited. FE approaches, while convenient, sub-
stantially restrict the nature of heterogeneity and 
fail to take into account potential common fac-
tors effects across individuals and the potential 
interdependence of the individual units (Baltagi 
2008, chapter 12; Chudik and Pesaran 2015b). 
De Serres, Scarpetta, and De La Maisonneuve 
(2002) extend the methodology to the PMG esti-
mator, which is only an intermediate heteroge-
neous estimator. 
Simon (2014) explored the relationship 
between unemployment and sectoral change 
across U.S. states during the Great Recession 
using Neumann and Topel's (1991) dispersion 
measure in a random effects model. Simon's 
findings stress the importance of structural fac-
tors and show that sectoral changes can account 
for an increase between 34% and 61% in median 
state unemployment between 2007 and 2009. 
Notwithstanding its methodological improve-
ment, Simon's approach cannot account for 
dynamics, heterogeneity, and CSD in the data. 
Even less so could previous attempts as they </p>



<p>ECONOMIC INQUIRY </p>

<p>were still framed in terms of pooled and FE 
estimation approaches. 
The relevance of the regional component lies 
in the different industrial composition of regions 
(states in the case of the United States). Behind 
aggregate data lies a very heterogeneous picture 
of regional labor markets reflecting disparate 
initial conditions (see also Draghi 2014). These 
dissimilar conditions encompass varying sectoral 
compositions of employment and unemployment 
across regions with unemployment rates his-
torically persistently higher in some areas than 
others. 5 
Dissimilar industrial compositions entail 
different levels of industrial agglomeration, 
concentration, and specialization. Clearly, the 
reallocation movements of a region with high 
agglomeration would have a different impact at 
aggregate level than those of a region with oppo-
site characteristics. The concentration levels of 
a specific industry may vary widely from region 
to region. If a sector is highly concentrated in 
a limited number of regions, then its fortunes 
would mostly affect a restricted area of the 
country, at least initially. At the same time, the 
regional degree of sectoral specialization (how 
an industrial sector is relatively large within the 
economy of a specific region) is likely to differ 
greatly across U.S. states. Allocative shocks 
would affect regional labor markets differently 
according to the initial state of the region indus-
trial composition and result in different patterns 
of inter and intra reallocation. A change in 
demand composition would affect differently a 
region highly specialized in declining sectors 
from one with a high specialization in expanding 
industries. Flows of workers from declining to 
expanding sectors could not necessarily take 
place within the same region. In some regions, 
the scale of job destruction relative to that of 
job creation may reduce the job-finding rate, 
increase the unemployment rate, the unemploy-
ment duration spells, and workers migration to 
more favorable areas. For instance, vis-à-vis a 
change in demand composition a region with an 
initially high specialization in declining sectors 
could not provide sufficient opportunities for 
reallocation in a short or medium run. Its work-
ers would have to look for employment in other </p>

<p>5. Dao, Furceri, and Loungani (2014) using state-specific 
data, estimate the dynamic effects of regional employment 
and unemployment. They conclude that the long-run effect 
of a state-specific shock on the state employment level has 
decreased over time. </p>

<p>regions and look for employment in regions with 
a favorable industrial composition. 
The process of intersectoral reallocation is 
characterized by heterogeneity, common global 
factors, and spillover effects at regional level. 
Conventional panel estimators (fixed or random 
effects), which have been the basis of previous 
research in this field, would result in misleading 
inferences and inconsistent estimators (Chudik 
and Pesaran 2015b). Recent advances in panel 
data econometrics with heterogenous slopes and 
a common factor structure (i.e., cross-sectional 
dependence) and in data availability would allow 
us to take into account with more rigor the issues 
of heterogeneity, spillovers, and common factors 
and thus testing and measuring the relevance of 
sectoral shifts with a higher degree of reliability. 
Because the outstanding literature on regional 
labor reallocation has not filled this gap, it is the 
aim of this article to do so. 
The current study revisits the SSH by bringing 
to bear heterogeneity, common factors, and CSD. 
We account for common factors (i.e., aggregate 
shocks and local spillovers) and investigate the 
effects of labor reallocation within U.S. states. 
First, we extend the homogeneous panel data 
approach, by employing the Driscoll and Kraay's 
(1998) pooled and fixed effects estimators. Sec-
ond, in order to obtain consistent estimates in 
a dynamic panel with substantial heterogeneity 
across regions, we use the Pesaran and Smith's 
(1995) mean group (MG) estimators. Third, 
because estimators assuming cross-sectional 
independence across regions could be inefficient, 
we extend the heterogeneous slopes MG esti-
mation procedure by implementing the common 
correlated effects (CCE) estimator proposed 
by Pesaran (2006), as well as the augmented 
mean group (AMG) estimator by Bond and 
Eberhardt (2009) and Eberhardt and Teal (2010) 
that accounts for CSD by means of a "common 
dynamic process." Fourth, given the presence of 
a lagged dependent variable in our specification 
form, we apply the recently proposed extension 
of the CCE estimator by Chudik and Pesaran 
(2015a) that allows for dynamic panels and 
relaxes the assumption of strict exogeneity. </p>

follows: </p>

<p>(1) 
U i,t = μ i + ϕ i U i,t−1 + β i σ i,t + λ ′ 
i z i , t + π ′ 
i w t + u i,t , 
where U i,t is the unemployment rate for state i 
at time t; σ i,t is the state measure of employ-
ment cross-sectoral dispersion; the vector z i,t rep-
resents a vector of state-specific control variables; 
in our specification, the state personal income 
growth, Δln(PI i,t ), is included. The vector of 
aggregate factors w t represents common control 
variables that capture aggregate demand shocks, 
common to all states, which in our specification 
includes the federal funds rate growth, ΔFR t , its 
variability, H t , and the government expenditures 
growth, Δln(G t ). Finally, μ i stands for a set of 
state-specific FE capturing the influence of unob-
served state-specific heterogeneity and u i,t is the 
error term. 6 
We allow for cross-correlation of the distur-
bances, u i,t , assuming that they follow a multifac-
tor error structure: </p>

<p>(2) 
u i,t = γ ′

where f t is a m × 1 vector of unobserved common 
factors that capture cross-sectional dependencies 
across states, and γ ′ </p>

<p>i </p>

<p>are the state-specific asso-
ciated factor loadings. The idiosyncratic errors, 
ε i,t , are assumed to be independently distributed 
across i and t with zero mean and constant vari-
ance. Following Chudik and Pesaran (2015b) and 
Chudik, Pesaran, and Tosetti (2011), the factor 
structure can be further decomposed as f t = f s </p>

neous panel in the form of an ARDL(1,0,0,0) model. The

priate model according to the Schwarz Bayesian criterion

served "strong" and "weak" common factors 
(i.e., unobserved heterogeneity due to country 
characteristics or regional spillover effects). 7 
Following Lilien (1982), the dispersion proxy 
for each state i at time t is calculated as the 
weighted standard deviation of the cross-sectoral 
employment growth rates using a K-sectoral 
decomposition as follows: 
(3) </p>

<p>σ i,t = </p>

<p>where n j,i,t is employment in sector j for state i at 
time t, N i,t = 
∑ K 
j=1 n j,i,t is aggregate employment 
at time t for state i, K is the number of sectors 
(with j = 1, 2, … , K sectors) in the state i, and the 
term n j,i,t∕ N i,t is the sector j share of total regional 
employment at time t. 
From the outset, the SSH has been beset 
by the problem of "observational equivalence" 
(Abraham and Katz 1986; Lilien 1982). The 
positive correlation between unemployment 
and sectoral dispersion (as measured by using 
Lilien's proxy) could be an outcome determined 
by either aggregate shocks, if cyclical respon-
siveness varies across sectors, or by changes 
in labor demand composition. Two alternative 
theories could accommodate the same stylized 
facts. Because of the "observation equivalence" 
problem, we filter out aggregate effects from 
the dispersion proxy (σ i,t ) and decompose it into 
an idiosyncratic component and a component 
measuring the response to aggregate shock. 8,9 To 
obtain the "purged" measure, we have regressed 
σ i,t on the vector of aggregate variables ̃

erature. For a full discussion of the issue, see Gallipoli and 
Pelloni (2008, 2013). 
9. Note that aggregate factors are also taken into account 
in the panel econometric specification and as a result any 
evidence in favor of labor reallocation can be considered as 
relatively "conservative." 
10. The choice of variables included in ̃ 
w t varies across 
articles. Here, the vector of aggregate variables ̃ 
w t is exactly 
the same as the vector w t . For a full discussion of this issue,

<p>"purged" dispersion index, that measures only the 
reallocation shocks, is then used in the reduced 
form unemployment Equation (1). 
We have included the federal funds rate 
growth, ΔFR t , as a proxy for the monetary 
policy instrument as well as its variability, H t . 
The measure of monetary policy variability 
has been generated by estimating a generalized 
autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity 
(GARCH) (1,1) model for ΔFR t and inter-
preting the estimated conditional variance as a 
parametric proxy of the monetary uncertainty 
(H t ). 11 The growth of government expenditures, 
Δln(G t ), is introduced to capture the effects of 
fiscal policy (Mills, Pelloni, and Zervoyianni 
1995) while the growth rate of state's personal 
income (Δln(PI i,t )) is used as a potential source 
of regional demand shocks. 12 
In order to analyze the effect of sectoral shifts 
using panel regressions for the U.S. states, we 
need to consider the issues of dynamics, hetero-
geneity, and CSD that emerge from the specifica-
tion of Equation (1). </p>

<p>A. Homogeneous Estimation Approach </p>

<p>The standard empirical macroeconometric 
literature employs pooled estimators adopted 
from the microeconometric literature, such as the 
least square dummy variable estimator allowing 
for individual FE. The FE model allows the 
intercepts to differ across regions, while all 
other coefficients are forced to be identical, 
and can be estimated by ordinary least squares 
(OLS) using a simple transformation (within 
estimator). We extend the homogeneous pooled 
OLS and FE estimators, by using the Driscoll 
and Kraay's (1998) extension of nonparametric 
variance-covariance matrix estimation, which 
produces heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation 
consistent standard errors that are robust to the 
presence of general forms of spatial and CSD. 
The presence of a lagged dependent variable 
among the regressors (U i,t − 1 ) results in a biased 
OLS FE estimator when T is fixed (Nickell 
1981). Therefore, several suggestions were pro-
posed in the literature. Kiviet (1995) proposes a </p>

similar approach to measure inflation uncertainty. 
12. We also implement the analysis using the 3-Month T-
Bill interest rate growth, ΔTB t , as the instrument for monetary 
policy and the government expenditures disaggregated in two 
parts, the federal government expenditure, Δln(FG t ), and the 
local/state government expenditures, Δln(SG t ), as the fiscal 
policy instruments for robustness purposes. </p>

<p>bias-corrected FE estimator, while Arellano and 
Bond (1991) recommend a generalized method 
of moments (GMM) estimation procedure. The 
difference GMM estimator (AB-GMM) of Arel-
lano and Bond (1991) first transforms the model 
using first differences to eliminate the individual 
effects and then uses the GMM framework of 
Hansen (1982). Following the work of Arellano 
and Bover (1995), Blundell and Bond (1998) 
put forward an extended system estimator that 
applies additional moment conditions, the sys-
tem GMM estimator (BB GMM), which we 
implement as a complement to the dynamic 
FE estimation. </p>

<p>B. Heterogeneous Estimation Approach </p>

<p>The previous standard pooled estimators 
assume slopes homogeneity across regions. 
These estimators yield inconsistent estimates in 
the case of a dynamic panel data model when the 
slope coefficients differ across regions (Pesaran 
and Smith 1995). Given the differences in labor 
market across the U.S. states, the homogeneity 
assumption is quite restrictive, and therefore 
the usage of pooled estimation methods may 
lead to a substantial heterogeneity bias in the 
estimated parameters of Lilien's panel version of 
Equation (1). 
One way to obtain consistent estimates in 
dynamic panels with considerable heterogene-
ity across regions is to use estimators that allow 
for slope heterogeneity across states. Pesaran 
and Smith (1995) propose the MG estimators 
that consists of estimating separate OLS regres-
sions for each region and then calculating aver-
ages of the specific coefficients over groups. 
Furthermore, Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (1999) 
suggest an intermediate estimator that imposes 
long-run slope homogeneity between regions but 
allows for short-run parameters heterogeneity. 
The PMG estimator involves both pooling and 
averaging of the individual regression coeffi-
cients in order to obtain more efficient estimates 
than the MG estimators under the assumption of 
slope homogeneity. 
Another crucial issue, that is relevant for 
the regional panel sectoral shifts analysis of 
unemployment, is the issue of CSD among 
states. Interdependence between cross-sections 
is an important characteristic in the analysis 
of macro-and regional panel data models, and 
estimators based on the assumption of cross-
sectional independence may prove inefficient 
or even inconsistent (Sarafidis and Wansbeek </p>

<p>BAKAS, PANAGIOTIDIS, &amp; PELLONI: MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS OF LABOR REALLOCATION </p>



<p>2012). Therefore, we extend the heterogeneous 
slopes estimation procedure by implementing 
the Pesaran (2006) CCE estimators that account 
for the presence of unobserved common factors 
by using cross-section averages of the depen-
dent and independent variables as additional 
regressors. Specifically, we consider the mean 
group CCE (CCEMG) extension of the estimator 
proposed in Pesaran and Smith (1995) as it is 
more appropriate for our heterogeneous panel 
data setting. In addition to the CCE approach, 
we implement the AMG estimator proposed by 
Bond and Eberhardt (2009) and Eberhardt and 
Teal (2010) that accounts for CSD by means of 
a "common dynamic process" in the regional 
regressions. The "common dynamic process" 
is extracted using year dummy coefficients of 
a pooled regression in first differences and rep-
resents the levels-equivalent mean evolution of 
unobserved common factors across all regions 
(Eberhardt and Teal 2010). 13 Finally, given the 
presence of a lagged dependent variable in our 
specification and the need to take into account 
simultaneously the issues of dynamics, hetero-
geneity, and CSD, we implement the recent 
extension of the Pesaran (2006) CCEMG esti-
mator proposed in Chudik and Pesaran (2015a) 
that permits the inclusion of lagged values of 
the dependent variable and/or weakly exogenous 
regressors in the panel data model. 
Chudik and Pesaran (2015a) allow the estima-
tion of heterogeneous panel data models with a 
lagged dependent variable. They show that the 
dynamic CCEMG (dynCCEMG) extension of the 
CCE estimator performs well and is asymptoti-
cally valid when (1) there is a sufficient number 
of lags of cross-section averages included in the 
individual equations of the panel alongside with 
the cross-section averages, and (2) the number of 
cross-section averages is at least as large as the 
number of unobserved common factors. 
In order to apply the dynCCEMG estimator, 
we augment Equation (1) with cross-section 
averages of the dependent and independent 
variables as well as their lags as additional 
regressors: </p>

<p>U i,t = μ i + ϕ i U i,t−1 + β i σ i,t + λ ′ 
i z i , t 
(5) </p>

<p>+ π ′ 
i w t + </p>

<p>p T </p>

<p>∑ </p>

<p>l=0 </p>

<p>δ ′ 
il v t−l + ε i,t , </p>

<p>13. Bond and Eberhardt (2009) provide evidence that 
both the CCEMG estimators and the AMG approach perform 
very well and with similar results in Monte Carlo studies. </p>

<p>where v t = N −1 ∑ N 
i=1 v i , t = </p>

<p>( 
U t , σ t , z t </p>

<p>) ′ 
. We 
perform the estimation using a different number 
of lags of cross-section averages up to the p T , 
where p T is equal to the integer part of T 1/3 as 
suggested by Chudik and Pesaran (2015a). 14 
Pesaran and Tosetti (2011) show that the CCE 
type estimators provide consistent estimates 
of the slope coefficients (and their SEs) under 
general cases of cross-sectional dependencies. 
The latter can arise from spatial spillovers 
or can be due to the presence of unobserved 
common factors. 
Prior to estimation, we examine the panel 
data properties of the series. Notably, we inves-
tigate (1) the order of integration of the series 
using panel unit root tests, (2) the assumption 
of cross-sectional independence among states 
using CSD tests, and (3) the issue of slopes het-
erogeneity across states using poolability tests. 
Detailed description of the tests is presented in 
the Appendix. 
Following this, we proceed to the main stage 
of the analysis by estimating the Lilien's dynamic 
reduced form unemployment relationship for the 
U.S. states panel, taking into account the issues 
of dynamics, heterogeneity, and common (aggre-
gate) factors through the induction of CSD, by 
considering alternative estimation procedures for 
homogeneous and heterogeneous panel data. </p>

<p>IV. DATA AND PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS </p>

<p>A. Data </p>

<p>The empirical analysis has been car-
ried out using monthly data over the period 
1990:M1-2011:M12 for the 48 contiguous U.S. 
states (12,672 observations overall). 15 Table 1 
presents the abbreviations of the U.S. states used 
in our analysis. The employment and unemploy-
ment per state series were obtained from the U.S. 
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). 
The sectoral shifts proxy is computed per 
state by using the employment shares of the 
available sectoral decomposition of monthly </p>

<p>14. Chudik and Pesaran (2015a) have also proposed time 
series bias-corrected versions of the mean group dynamic 
CCE (dynCCEMG) estimator. Because our interest is on the 
coefficient of σ i,t and not on the parameter of the lagged 
depended variable (U i,t − 1 ), and following the suggestion of 
Chudik and Pesaran (2015a) that the uncorrected dynCCEMG 
estimator is preferred, we thus present results without the 
bias-corrected version of the dynCCEMG estimator. 
15. We exclude from our analysis the nonadjoining states 
of Alaska and Hawaii. </p>

<p>Our preliminary analysis starts with the

<p>and 2 present the unemployment rate and Lilien's 
proxy graphs at the national and regional U.S. 
level, respectively. Figure 1 shows the aggregate 
unemployment rate and the alternative measures 
of the dispersion index for the United States. We 
can observe that both dispersion indexes (σ 9 </p>

<p>i,t </p>

<p>and σ 13 </p>

<p>i,t </p>

<p>) have similar patterns, and that both are 
rising sharply during recessions (early 1990s, 
2001, and the Great Recession of 2007-2009) as 
measured by the National Bureau of Economic 
Research (NBER). Furthermore, the two dis-
persion indexes, the unpurged Lilien's measure 
as well as its "purged" counterpart, display a 
similar behavior. </p>

Unemployment Rate and Lilien's Index for the U.S. Aggregate, 1990:M1-2011:M12 </p>

<p>Figure 2 present the state-by-state graphs 
of the unemployment rate and the dispersion 
indexes. The graphs per state reveal similar 
patterns to the aggregate behavior. However, the 
presence of substantial heterogeneity is obvious 
for both the unemployment rate and the disper-
sion index across states. Thus, it is essential to 
take into account this heterogeneity (alongside </p>

<p>any potential interdependence across U.S. states) 
in our panel data analysis.

<p>reallocation, followed by CA, NY, and TX. A 
more clear picture is emerging from Table 4 that 
presents the regional employment structure per 
U.S. state. Comparing 1990 with 2011, one of 
the most important characteristics emerging from 
these two decades was the decline of traditional 
sectors such as manufacturing. Focusing again 
on the four largest states, we can observe that 
in 1990, manufacturing did represent 15.70% 
of employment in CA, 13.30% in TX, 12% in 
NY, and 9.46% in FL. Twenty-one years later, 
the percentages are 8.9% (CA), 7.9% (TX), 
5.3% (NY), and 4.28% (FL). This momentous 
decline was accompanied by an increase in new, 
more dynamic sectors on the services side of 
the economy. </p>

<p>V. EMPIRICAL RESULTS </p>

<p>We begin our analysis by conducting formal 
tests to examine the properties of poolability, 
CSD, and stationarity (unit roots) for our panel 
data set. Specifically, we conduct univariate and 
panel unit root tests to determine the level of 
integration of our series. We perform the aug-
mented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root tests for 
the variables that are common to all states, FR t , 
H t , TB t , ln(G t ), ln(FG t ), and ln(SG t ). Addition-
ally, we employ one first-generation (the IPS test 
of Im, Pesaran, and Shin 2003) and one second-
generation (the cross-sectionally augmented IPS 
[CIPS] test of Pesaran 2007 that accounts for 
CSD) panel unit root test for our panel variables 
(U i,t , σ i,t , and ln(PI i,t )). Table 5 presents the 
ADF unit root tests. They reveal that all variables 
are I(1) except H t which is I(0). The panel 
results, reported in Table 6, bear out that both 
tests clearly indicate that the unemployment 
series and the sectoral shifts index are stationary 
variables, while state personal income is found 
to be I(1). Within a time series perspective, 
Abadir, Caggiano, and Talmain (2013) also 
claim that unemployment series are not of the 
integrated type. 
The issue of CSD is examined by apply-
ing the CD P and CD LM versions of the CSD 
test (Table 7). The null hypothesis of no cross-
sectional correlation among the U.S. states panel 
is rejected at the 5% level of significance, indi-
cating that the hypothesis of cross-sectional inde-
pendence in our dataset is clearly violated and 
thus we need to account for CSD across the 
U.S. states. 
Furthermore, the assumption of common 
slope parameters in our states panel estimation is </p>

<p>(σ 9 
t and σ 13 
t ), and different methods of estimation 
(OLS and GMM), we can observe a positive 
and significant relationship between unemploy-
ment rate and the measures of dispersion. These 
results support the view of Mills, Pelloni, and 
Zervoyianni (1995) and extend their time series 
evidence to the recent period (1990-2011). The 
time series approach for the aggregate specifica-
tion (Table 9) reflects Lilien's initial specification 
that cannot discriminate between aggregate and 
sectoral shocks. Furthermore, it does not take 
into account the regional dimension and the 
mobility between states (note also the increase 
in the number of observations from 263 in the 
time series case to 12,624 in the panel data case). 
Such time series modeling suffers from poten-
tial aggregation bias and employs a relatively 
limited dataset. 
Hence, we proceed by estimating a panel ver-
sion of Lilien's dynamic reduced form unemploy-
ment relationship for the U.S. states, and take into 
account the issues of dynamics, heterogeneity, 
and common factors. In addition, for robustness, 
we also employ alternative estimation approaches 
for both homogeneous and heterogeneous 
panel data. Analogously to the classification of 
Eberhardt, Helmers, and Strauss (2013), Table 10 
presents an overview of the adopted estimators 
and classifies them according to the assumptions 
made over CSD and parameter heterogeneity. </p>

<p>Having established a significant positive evi-
dence on the aggregate level, we examine the 
regional dimension of the sectoral reallocation 
for the 48 U.S. states using panel estimates of 
the dynamic reduced form Equation (1) as an 
autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL)(1,0,0,0) 
specification (see footnote 3). 20 Table 11 presents 
the initial (homogeneous) panel estimates of the </p>

<p>20. In order to produce results that clearly distinguish 
the aggregate effects from the dispersion proxy, we proceed 
to estimate the dynamic reduced form Equation (1) using 
the "purged" dispersion index in our analysis (Abraham and 
Katz 1986). The results using the unpurged sigma index are 
qualitatively similar. These results are available upon request. </p>

<p>effects of Lilien's sigma index on the unem-
ployment rate in the U.S. states. In all alter-
native specifications-the Driscoll and Kraay's 
(1998) pooled ordinary least squares (POLS) and 
FE estimators, robust to CSD, and the dynamic 
GMM approach, robust to endogeneity issues 
of explanatory variables-we observe a signifi-
cant but almost negligible negative effect of the 
measure of monetary policy shock (ΔFR t ) on 
unemployment and a small positive impact of 
monetary policy variability (H t ). The impact of 
the fiscal policy (Δln(G t )) is found to be posi-
tive and significant. Finally, the effect of state-
specific personal income (Δln(PI i,t )) is negative 
and highly significant in all specifications. All 
alternative estimation methods yield a positive 
and significant effect of the dispersion index 
on unemployment, with an impact ranging from 
0.61 (in the case of the logarithmic transforma-
tion using the POLS estimator) to 0.82 (in the 
version of logistic transformation with the FE 
model). The evidence from the homogeneous 
panel estimates strongly corroborates previous 
results of a significant effect of allocative shocks 
(see among others, De Serres, Scarpetta, and </p>

<p>De La Maisonneuve 2002, Estevão and Tsounta 
2011, Simon 2014). 
So far, we have established that purged sigma 
as a measure of labor reallocation is positive and 
statistically significant at the aggregate level for 
the United States (Table 9). The same holds as we 
move from the time series dimension (T = 264) to 
the homogeneous panel (POLS, FE, and GMM) 
estimation (T = 264 and N = 48) in Table 11. 
However, these homogeneous parameter method-
ologies, used by all previous studies, do not take 
into account aggregate factors and state spillover 
effects which is macroeconomically important in

Table 12 that presents the heterogeneous panel

Table 12 presents the estimates that were

take into account heterogeneity (MG) as well as

<p>ECONOMIC INQUIRY </p>

<p>highlight the statistical significance of the lagged 
value of unemployment. This persistence is well 
documented in the literature. With regard to 
the coefficient of sigma, we observe that the 
"purged" dispersion index is affecting unemploy-
ment rate in a positive and statistically signifi-
cant way in all alternative estimation techniques 
for both the logistic and the logarithmic trans-
formation of unemployment. The sigma (σ i,t ) 
coefficient ranges from 0.41 (0.38) in the logis-
tic transformation (logarithmic transformation) 
using the heterogeneous CCEMG estimator of 
Pesaran (2006) that accounts for CSD to 0.88 
(0.81) in the MG estimator of Pesaran and Smith 
(1995) that allows for slope heterogeneity but 
assumes cross-sectional independence. The MG 
(heterogeneous) coefficient of 0.877 (column 1 
in Table 12) is of similar magnitude with the DK 
FE (homogeneous) coefficient of 0.819 (column 
2 in Table 11) but is reduced (almost by half) 
to the 0.433 under dynCCEMG that accounds 
for both heterogeneity and CSD. The latter high-
lights that when the cross-state dependence is 
taken into account, the effects of labor realloca-
tion is halved. Moreover, once we consider the 
heterogeneous estimates that account for CSD 
through the CCE approach (CCEMG and dynC-
CEMG), the impact of sigma on unemployment 
is about half of that emerging from the homo-
geneous estimates in Table 11. This positive and 
significant effect of purged sigma is a notewor-
thy result because it corroborates the labor RH 
when one takes into account aggregate factors in 
the econometric specification via the CSD. 
The coefficient of the growth rate of the 
state's personal income (Δln(PI i,t )) is negative 
and significant under all specifications. This vari-
able is state specific and the estimates reflect 
the inverse relationship between unemployment 
and the growth rate of income (an estimate of 
the Okun's coefficient in a sense). The mone-
tary policy growth rate (ΔFR t ) is significant with 
a negative sign in the homogeneous parameter 
estimates and for the MG and AMG. Once we 
properly account for common factors through 
the Pesaran's CCE approach in the specifica-
tion (CCEMG and dynCCEMG), its significance 
evaporates. The monetary policy variability (H t ) 
displays a similar behavior: it is positive and 
significant under cross-sectional independence 
while it becomes insignificant when we allow for 
CSD. Finally, Δln(G t ) has a coefficient which 
is positive and significant both in the homo-
geneous parameter estimates (Table 11) and in 
the heterogeneous parameter estimates if CSD is </p>

<p>ignored (MG in Table 12). Under the CCEMG 
and dynCCEMG approaches, its significance dis-
appears. The root mean squared error (RMSE) 
statistic is provided in both the homogeneous and 
in the heterogeneous case (Tables 11 and 12). 
We observe a reduction of the RMSE of about 
20.4% for the dynCCEMG 1 and 26.7% for the 
dynCCEMG 6 estimates in the logistic specifica-
tion and 24.7% for the dynCCEMG 1 and 30.6% 
for the dynCCEMG 6 estimates in the logarithmic 
specification compared to the homogeneous esti-
mates (DK FE). This decrease in the measure of 
goodness of fit indicates the importance of CSD 
and parameter heterogeneity in the U.S. states 
panel analysis. The preferred model for both 
the logistic and the logarithmic transformation 
of unemployment is the Chudik and Pesaran's 
dynCCEMG 6 (with the addition of six lags of 
cross-section averages) estimator that accounts 
for dynamics in the specification where labor 
reallocation and state income are the only vari-
ables that enter in a statistically significant fash-
ion (positive the former and negative the latter). 21 
The CCE type estimators (CCEMG and dynC-
CEMG) account for the presence of unobserved 
common factors with state-specific impact, such 
as "strong" factors which reflects aggregate 
shocks that affect all states and "weak" factors 
which reflects regional spillovers that affects only 
subsets of states. The augmentation of the panel 
regression equations with the cross-section aver-
ages of the dependent and independent variables, 
as formulated by the standard CCE approach, is 
based on an equal weighting scheme of the cross-
section averages for all states. In order to test 
whether the cross-sectional spillover effects are 
stronger among states which share borders, and 
thus, have an impact on the estimated coefficient 
of sigma, we follow the approach of Eberhardt 
and Teal (2013), and impose a weighting scheme 
for the construction of the cross-section averages 
based on the spatial neighborhood informa-
tion among the U.S. states. 22 Thus, using this </p>

<p>21. The vector of aggregate common control variables 
w t (which here includes ΔFR t , H t , and Δln(G t )) that capture 
aggregate demand shocks can be viewed in the heterogeneous 
dynamic panel data modeling with a common factor approach 
(CCEMG and dynCCEMG) as a vector of "observed" com-
mon factors with state-specific impact. Thus, the inclusion 
of these variables in the CCEMG and dynCCEMG models 
tend to approximate the unobservable common factors, f t , in 
addition to the cross-sectional averages of the dependent and 
independent variables (see Chudik and Pesaran 2015b and 
Pesaran, Smith, and Yamagata 2013).

drawing our attention to this point. </p>

<p>"border/neighborhood impact"-weighted CCE 
approach, we can test the hypothesis that state i is 
affected mainly by "weak" unobserved common 
factors which are similar in states that share bor-
ders (i.e., spatial spillovers), but is less affected 
by the set of the common "strong" factors which 
influence states without border neighborhoods. 
Table 12 (columns 7-9 and 16-18) presents the 
estimations based on the "neighbor"-weighted 
CCEMG estimator. The results show that the 
"neighbor"-weighted CCE approach provides 
similar estimated coefficients of sigma with the 
estimates without the neighborhood-weighted 
scheme, and confirms that the CCE approach 
of Pesaran (2006) is effective to deal with more 
general cases of error cross-section dependencies 
such as spatial error spillover effects, see Pesaran 
and Tosetti (2011). 23 
Independently from the different set-up 
assumptions, all the alternative empirical esti-
mators, bear out a positive and significant effect 
of the dispersion index on unemployment. How-
ever, we can observe that in the preferred model 
(dynCCEMG 6 ), which accounts for both het-
erogeneity and CSD, the coefficient of sigma 
is half what is under the FE (homogeneous 
case) as well as under the MG (heterogeneous 
case) estimators. </p>

<p>A. Robustness Check </p>

<p>Given the conclusion from the previous 
section where labor reallocation was found 
to have a positive and significant effect on 
unemployment, we assess the robustness of our 
results. Table 13 presents the results for the 
dynCCEMG estimator under alternative specifi-
cations (dynCCEMG 1 ). The first column repeats 
the column 5 from Table 12 (coefficient 0.433). 
In the second specification, we replace purged 
sigma with the unpurged reallocation index. In 
columns 3, 5, 6, and 8, we consider alternative 
purging mechanisms and a more disaggregated 
sigma (σ 13 </p>

<p>i,t </p>

<p>). In column 4, we examine the impact 
of state's personal income on the results. In 
column 5, we have replaced ΔFR t with the 
growth rate of the Treasury Bill (ΔTB t ) and 
its GARCH volatility (H TB 
t ). Finally, column 
7 replaces Δln(G t ) with fiscal policy dissagre-
gated in federal government, Δln(FG t ), and state 
government, Δln(SG t ). The overall conclusion </p>

<p>23. According to Pesaran and Tosetti (2011), the attrac-
tion of the CCE approach is that it does not require a quan-
tification of the exact relative position of the units in space, 
which is required by the spatial type estimators. </p>

<p>is that the effect of labor reallocation on unem-
ployment remains positive and significant in all 
cases, so further strengthening the above results 
(average coefficient 0.43). 
How could the first-generation "homoge-
neous" estimates compare with those taking into 
account the dynamics, heterogeneity, and CSD? 
Looking at Tables 11 and 12, we can compare the 
dispersion index effect on unemployment both 
under POLS and FE (first-generation estimates) 
with the "heterogeneous" dynCCEMG estimator 
that accounts for dynamics in the specification. 
The former overestimates the impact of reallo-
cation (0.66 and 0.82 compared with 0.43 and 
0.49 when accounting for both heterogeneity and 
CSD). This upward bias stems from ignoring 
CSD in the estimates. The heterogeneity bias is 
negligible due to the relatively large time dimen-
sion of our data set (T = 264 and T &gt; N). 24,25 
Our results, using a "purged" Lilien's (1982) dis-
persion proxy, are considerably higher than those 
reported by Simon (2014) based on Neumann 
and Topel's (1991) dispersion measure. 
Finally, when we deal with CSD by means of 
a "common dynamic process" using the AMG 
estimator, we can see that the impact of sigma is 
higher and more significant than that computed 
with the CCE approach (CCEMG and dynC-
CEMG). Instead, it is close to the effect generated 
by the standard heterogeneous MG estimator. 
However, the t-stat for the coefficient generated 
under the AMG estimator is at least twice as 
large. This outcome holds also when we use the 
logarithmic transformation of unemployment. 
Given the evidence so far and taking into 
account the verification of CSD and parameter 
heterogeneity in the U.S. states panel, we turn our 
analysis to the response of the unemployment rate 
to different levels of disaggregation of the disper-
sion index using the dynamic common correlated 
effects mean group (dynCCEMG) estimator of 
Chudik and Pesaran (2015a). To facilitate com-
parisons, we implement a homogeneous counter-
part, the Driscoll and Kraay's (1998) FE estima-
tor. The alternative measures of dispersion affect 
unemployment both positively and significantly </p>

<p>24. The mean group "heterogeneous" estimation results 
are found to be qualitatively but also quantitatively very sim-
ilar with those of the fixed effects "homogeneous" estimates. 
25. Sarafidis and Wansbeek (2012) present evidence 
that estimators neglecting cross-sectional dependence across 
errors are inefficient and their estimated standard errors are 
biased and inconsistent. Everaert and De Groote (2016) show 
that the bias due to cross-sectional dependence is positive for 
large values of T, as it is in our case, and that the bias does 
not decrease as T grows. </p>

<p>(Table 14). When we focus on the effectiveness of 
the dispersion index on unemployment, we find 
that the impact of the dispersion index depends on 
the level of disaggregation embodied in its con-
struction. The more disaggregated sigma is (σ i,t ), 
the weaker is its impact and the lower is its signif-
icance (lower estimate and t-stat in the case of 13 
sectors, see Table 14). This is of interest because 
these alternative indexes appear to be qualita-
tively similar (see the summary statistics of the 
dispersion indexes in Table 2). This result sup-
ports Parker's (1992) argument suggesting that 
it is mobility across the four major sectors that </p>

<p>index, includes construction, finance,

Summing up, our results highlight the posi-
tive (though not as large as initially though under 
simpler assumptions) and significant impact of 
the dispersion index on unemployment and bear 
out the evidence of Lilien (1982). This corrob-
oration emerges in the dual sectoral and geo-
graphical dimension of our panel data approach 
which accounts for dynamics, heterogeneity, and 
common (aggregate) factors via CSD. The evi-
dence that emerges conforms with the recent 
empirical literature (see Estevão and Tsounta

Our analysis reveals the significance of labor

gate shocks) are taken into account. </p>

<p>VI. CONCLUSIONS </p>

<p>Draghi (2014) points out that behind aggre-
gate data lies a very heterogeneous picture. Our 
exercise walks in a similar path with the aim to 
reveal the extend at which the regional dimension 
in the labor reallocation process is affecting the 
macroeconomic behavior of unemployment. We 
study the unemployment effects of labor realloca-
tion within U.S. states and extend previous anal-
ysis in this field in two dimensions. First, we use 
a large monthly dataset spanning more than two 
decades for 48 U.S. states (12,672 observations). 
Thus, we can overcome the limited data sets 
constraint of several past aggregate time series 
approaches. Second, for the first time in the anal-
ysis of the unemployment effects of labor real-
location, we introduce recent panel data estima-
tion techniques that can account for the dynam-
ics, parameter heterogeneity, aggregate factors, 
and CSD. These issues are inherent and crucial 
to the macroeconomic problem and have not been 
addressed previously. 
Labor reallocation has been captured by a 
"purged" Lilien's dispersion index which was 
calculated for different levels of disaggregation to 
examine the sensitivity of the outcome. Empirical 
evidence bears out the presence of CSD as well 
as the heterogeneity among states and as a result 
they should be taken into account explicitly. The 
findings provide strong support for a positive 
and significant effect of the alternative measures 
of dispersion on unemployment. The impact of 
labor dispersion index on unemployment is half 
the size (although still positive and significant) 
when heterogeneity and cross-state dependence 
is taken into account. This outcome is robust 
under alternative specifications and assumptions. </p>

<p>APPENDIX </p>

<p>POOLABILITY TESTS </p>

<p>An important issue for the estimation of panel data mod-
els is the assumption of common slope coefficients across 
regions, that is β i = β with i = 1, 2, … , N. Following Baltagi 
(2008), this can be tested by a simple Chow test, see Chow </p>



<p>ECONOMIC INQUIRY </p>

<p>(1960), that is extended to the case of N linear regressions. 
The test for the poolability of the data across regions sim-
ply compares the restricted residual sum of squares (RSS r ) of 
the fixed effects model with the unrestricted residual sum of 
squares (RSS u ) obtained by the region-specific OLS regres-
sions. Under the null hypothesis of poolability across regions 
the Chow test can be defined as: </p>

<p>(A1) 
F = ((RSS r −RSS u )∕(N−1)k) ∕(RSS u ∕N(T−k−1)), </p>

<p>where, under the null of homogeneity, the Chow test is 
distributed as an F-statistic with (N − 1)k and N(T − k − 1) 
degrees of freedom, and is valid for panels where N is small 
relative to T, as in our case. 
Pesaran and Yamagata (2008) proposed a standardized 
version of Swamy's (1970) statistic in order to test for slope 
homogeneity in large panels (where N and T are both large). 
The standardized Delta test statistic ( ̃ 
Δ) can be defined by </p>

<p>(A2)

Δ = 
√ 
N </p>

<p>(( </p>

<p>N −1̃ S−k </p>

<p>) </p>

<p>√

, </p>

<p>and the bias-adjusted version of the Delta test statistic is </p>

Δ adj = 
√

<p>(( </p>

<p>N −1̃ S−E(̃ z iT) </p>

<p>) </p>

<p>∕ 
√ </p>

<p>Var(̃ z iT) </p>

<p>) 
, </p>

<p>where E 
( 
̃ z iT 
) 
= k and Var 
( 
̃ z iT 
) 
= (2k(T−k−1)) ∕(T+1), and ̃ S is 
the modified version of Swamy's (1970) statistic that based on 
the dispersion of individual slope estimates from a weighted 
fixed effects pooled estimator. The Delta test and its bias-
adjusted version have an asymptotic standard normal dis-
tribution under homogeneity null and as (N, T) → ∞ with 
√ 
N∕T 2 → 0. </p>

<p>CROSS-SECTIONAL DEPENDENCE TEST </p>

<p>In order to determine the existence of CSD among 
states, we employ the simple tests suggested by Pesaran 
(2004). The CSD test statistics are based on the average of 
pair-wise correlation coefficients (̂ ρ ij ) of the OLS residuals, 
obtained from the individual ADF regressions. The CD P test 
is given by: </p>

<p>(A4) 
CD P = 
√ ( 
2T ∕(N(N−1)) 
) 
( N−1 ∑ </p>

<p>i=1 </p>

<p>N </p>

<p>∑ </p>

<p>j=i+1 </p>

<p>̂ ρ ij </p>

<p>) </p>

<p>. </p>

<p>The CD P statistic under the null of cross-independence is 
distributed as a two-tailed standard normal distribution, that 
is, CD P ∼ N(0, 1) for T ij &gt; 3 and sufficient large N. 
Since in our context we have relatively small N and 
sufficiently large T (T &gt; N), we also employ the scaled version 
of the Lagrange multiplier (LM) test of Breusch and Pagan 
(1980), that is proposed by Pesaran (2004) and is based on 
the squares of the pair-wise correlation coefficients, that can 
be written as follows: </p>

<p>(A5) CD LM = 
√ ( 
1 ∕(N(N−1)) 
) 
( N−1 ∑ </p>

<p>i=1 </p>

<p>N </p>

<p>∑ </p>

<p>j=i+1 </p>

<p>( 
T̂ ρ 2 
ij − 1 </p>

<p>) 
) </p>

<p>. </p>

<p>which under the null hypothesis and following that T → ∞ 
first and then N → ∞ the CD LM statistic is asymptotically 
N(0, 1). 
Baltagi, Bresson, and Pirotte (2007) provide evidence that 
the general cross-sectional dependency test, CD p , can be also 
employed as a useful diagnostic test for various models of 
spatial dependence. </p>

<p>PANEL UNIT ROOT TESTS </p>

<p>Before proceeding with the panel estimation, we need 
to examine the order of integration of the series under con-
sideration. We employ conventional univariate ADF tests 
(on the series that are not state specific) as well as the 
IPS panel unit root test of Im, Pesaran, and Shin (2003) 
and the CIPS panel test of Pesaran (2007) that takes into 
account CSD among panel members (on the state-specific 
panel variables). </p>

<p>Panel Unit Root Tests without CSD </p>

<p>This panel test is an extension of the univariate ADF 
regression as follows: </p>

<p>(A6) 
Δy i,t = α i + ϕ i y i,t−1 + </p>

<p>p i </p>

<p>∑ </p>

<p>j=1 </p>

<p>θ i,j Δy i,t−j + e i,t , </p>

<p>where y i,t stands for each series under consideration for 
state i at time t. The null hypothesis is that all series 
contains a unit root, ϕ i = 0 for all i (with i = 1, 2, … , N), 
while the alternative hypothesis assumes that some of 
the N panel units are stationary with individual specific 
autoregressive coefficients. 
Im, Pesaran, and Shin (2003) propose a test based on the 
average of the ADF statistics computed for each individual in 
the panel. Specifically, the IPS statistic is defined as: </p>

<p>(A7) 
t N,T = 
1 
N </p>

<p>N </p>

<p>∑ </p>

<p>i=1 </p>

<p>t iT 
( 
p i , θ i 
) 
. </p>

<p>Under the assumption of cross-sectional independence, 
this statistic is shown to converge to a normal distribution. </p>

<p>Panel Unit Root Tests with CSD </p>

<p>The IPS test that is based on the restrictive assumption 
that the series are independent across states i, suffers from 
serious size distortion and restricted power in the presence of 
CSD (O'Connell 1998) and cross-sectional cointegrating rela-
tionships (Banerjee, Marcellino, and Osbat 2004). In order to 
overcome this, Pesaran (2007) proposes a simple approach to 
deal with the problem of CSD. A one-factor model is con-
sidered with heterogeneous factor loadings for residuals and 
suggests augmenting the standard ADF regression with the 
cross-section averages of lagged levels and first-differences 
of the individual series. The regression used for the i th cross-
section unit is defined as: </p>

<p>Δy i,t = α i + ϕ i y i,t−1 + c i y t−1 + </p>

<p>p i </p>

<p>∑ </p>

<p>j=0 </p>

<p>θ i,j Δy t−j 
(A8) </p>

<p>+ </p>

<p>p i </p>

<p>∑ </p>

<p>j=1 </p>

<p>θ i,j Δy i,t−j + e i,t , </p>

<p>where y t−1 = N −1 ∑ N 
i=1 y i,t−1 and Δy t = N −1 ∑ N 
i=1 y i,t = y t − 
y t−1 . The CIPS test is based on the average of individual cross-
sectionally augmented ADF statistics (CADF) as follows: </p>

<p>(A9) 
CIPS = 
1 
N </p>

<p>N </p>

<p>∑ </p>

<p>i=1 </p>

<p>t i (N, T) . </p>

<p>Simulated critical values of CIPS are listed in Pesaran 
(2007). Baltagi, Bresson, and Pirotte (2007) show that the 
CIPS test is found to be robust to the presence of other sources 
of CSD such as the spatial form. </p>

<p>Payment diaries measure consumer expenditures by tracking authorization of pay-
ments by instrument (cash, check, debit or credit card, etc.). Three notable results 
emerge from comparing the 2012 Diary of Consumer Payment Choice (DCPC) to other 
estimates of consumer expenditures: (1) DCPC payments are 75% higher than Con-
sumer Expenditure Survey estimates; (2) DCPC consumption estimates are 17% higher 
than comparable personal consumption expenditure estimates; and (3) DCPC payments 
roughly equal comparably adjusted National Income and Product Accounts personal 
disposable income. The DCPC's relative success stems from measuring expenditures 
aggregated into lumpy payments ("shopping baskets"), relatively low respondent bur-
den, and effective random sampling. (JEL E21, D12, D14) </p>

<p>Obtaining the best possible estimates of 
consumer expenditures is crucial to proper 
construction of consumption data and applied 
economic research on consumer behavior. Mea-
suring consumer expenditures well is complex 
and difficult, as is evident in the comprehensive 
volume by Carroll, Crossley, and Sabelhaus  (2015). The challenges, which are manifest 
in discrepancies between microeconomic and 
aggregate estimates of consumption and related 
data, as documented by Cynamon and Fazzari  (2015) and Fixler et al. (2016) among others, 
confound efforts to understand households' 
responses to the recent financial crisis. One basic 
problem is that the leading U.S. data source, 
the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE), covers </p>

<p>ECONOMIC INQUIRY </p>

<p>amounted to between 72% and 111% of national 
income estimates of consumption, suggesting 
that payments data might contribute to a solu-
tion. 1 Though imperfect, these relatively high 
estimates merit further investigation. 
This article uses the Boston Fed's 2012 
Diary of Consumer Payment Choice (DCPC) to 
describe and quantify the advantages of collect-
ing consumer expenditure data using payment 
diaries that record daily authorizations by the 
type of payment instrument (cash, check, money 
order, debit or credit card, online banking, etc.) 
at the point of sale (POS), for bill payment 
(BP), and for all other payments. The DCPC 
was implemented daily in October 2012, with 
a representative sample of U.S. consumers in 
conjunction with the Boston Fed's annual, recall-
based Survey of Consumer Payment Choice 
(SCPC), which does not collect expenditure val-
ues. According to the 2012 DCPC, the average 
U.S. consumer made 1.9 payments per day (58 
per month) worth $124 daily ($3,859 per month 
or $46,308 per year). Cash accounted for 41% of 
consumer payments (the most) by number, but 
for only 12% by dollar value, because the dollar 
value of the average cash payment was lowest 
($19) among the payment instruments. 
In theory, measured properly, consumer 
payments represent a nearly comprehensive 
distribution of personal income, comprising: (1) 
consumer expenditures for nondurable goods and 
services plus investment in durable goods, (2) all 
taxes, and (3) the part of personal saving asso-
ciated with payments that transfer money from 
cash or deposit accounts to other assets (an asset 
transfer) or liability accounts (such as loan repay-
ments). 2 In practice, however, payment diaries 
typically measure only expenditures made 
directly by consumers for themselves. Thus, 
diaries typically exclude the expenditures made 
on behalf of consumers by third parties such as 
employers, although these third-party expendi-
tures could be tracked with more-comprehensive 
diary surveys or other data sources. 
Consumer payment diaries have several 
advantages for collecting expenditure data. Like </p>

<p>1. This cross-country comparison of consumer payment 
diary surveys shows that consumer expenditures are remark-
ably similar across developed countries, especially the num-
ber of payments per day and the daily value of expenditures 
(the latter adjusted for income differences), although choices 
of payment instruments vary more across countries. 
2. For a more comprehensive treatment of integrated 
financial accounts see Samphantharak and Townsend (2010), 
and for a more detailed application to payments data, see 
Samphantharak, Schuh, and Townsend (2017).   other diary surveys, the DCPC asks respondents 
to record their expenditures each day. In most 
cases, recording is done at the point of payment 
throughout the day, although in some cases it 
may not occur until the end of the day. Daily 
recording of payments data involves less mea-
surement error from memory loss than typically 
occurs with recall-based surveys (CE-S), which 
rely on respondents' recollections of past expen-
ditures after the passage of more than a day, 
typically a week, month, or longer period of 
time. Moreover, payment diaries achieve better 
coverage of all types of consumer expenditures 
than product diaries because they increase cov-
erage and recall by aggregating expenditures 
into lumpy purchases ("baskets") by payment 
instrument rather than tracking or attempting to 
track every single individual good and service 
purchased. 3 By tracking all payments autho-
rized by instruments (a small number relative 
to the number of individual items purchased), 
payment diaries also achieve broader coverage 
of household economic activity than typical 
consumer surveys that focus on a narrower 
range of expenditures or more-highly aggregated 
survey categories that combine easily forgotten 
smaller expenditures. Combined with properly 
designed, high-frequency sampling strategies, 
payment diaries require relatively short partici-
pation periods (3 days) and a lower respondent 
burden. Together, these advantages significantly 
improve estimates of aggregate expenditures, but 
they also involve at least two nontrivial costs: 
(1) payment diaries cannot identify the amount 
spent on individual goods and services (or their 
quantities and per-unit prices) and (2) short 
participation periods are not accurate reflections 
of consumer expenditures over more-relevant 
longer periods like units tracked in budget cycles 
(week, month) or income frequencies (weekly,  bi-weekly, monthly). 
This article evaluates the ability of the 2012 
DCPC to estimate U.S. consumer expenditures 
and income by comparing and contrasting DCPC 
aggregate estimates with estimates from other 
leading surveys and data sources. The primary 
focus is on comparing the DCPC estimates with 
estimates from the CE, the leading U.S. data 
source that has both a CE-S and a recording-
based product diary (CE-D) instrument. Also </p>

<p>3. When a consumer buys 50 items at a grocery store and 
pays $200 for the entire shopping basket with a debit card, 
the $200 debit card payment equals the nominal value of all 
50 consumption goods in the basket. </p>

<p>SCHUH: PAYMENT DIARIES </p>



<p>included in the analysis are consumer expendi-
ture estimates from the Financial Crisis Surveys 
(FCS) of Hurd and Rohwedder (2010) and the 
Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). Aggregate 
DCPC estimates of consumption expenditures 
and total payments are compared with data from 
the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts 
(NIPA) on PCE and disposable personal income. 
The overall conclusion of this study is that 
the October 2012 DCPC produces estimates of 
consumer expenditures that are surprisingly bet-
ter than other leading data sources. Three notable 
results emerge from the analysis. First, DCPC 
payments are 75% higher than CE estimates. 
Second, DCPC consumption is 17% higher than 
NIPA estimates in comparable expenditure cat-
egories (which, taken together, represent about 
half of PCE). And third, DCPC total payments 
roughly equal NIPA disposable income, adjusted 
for comparability. 
Given its relative success in estimating con-
sumer expenditures and income, the DCPC 
appears to merit use for research on income, 
consumption, and saving at the micro and macro 
levels. For example, daily consumer payments 
in the DCPC are highest near paydays and 
dates of other income receipt, a result consistent 
with findings of Stephens (2003, 2006), Parker  et al. (2013), Gelman et al. (2014, 2015), Baker  (2016), Parker (2016), and Pagel and Vardardottir  (2016). Samphantharak, Schuh, and Townsend  (2017) show how the DCPC tracks cash flow 
dynamics more effectively than other surveys 
do. Overall, payment diary data are essentially 
the same as transaction records from banks and 
other financial institutions, such as those used 
by Ganong and Noel (2016) among others, but 
the payment diaries offer distinct advantages 
described later. 
The remainder of the article proceeds as fol-
lows. Section II describes the leading surveys and 
methods used to collect U.S. consumer expendi-
ture data, and Section III describes the Boston 
Fed's DCPC in more detail. Section IV explains 
the conceptual relationship between consumer 
payments and expenditures. Section V com-
pares estimates of aggregate consumer payments 
(DCPC) with aggregate consumer expenditures 
from other surveys (CE, FCS, and SCF), and 
with consumption (PCE) in comparable expen-
diture categories. Section VI compares estimates 
of aggregate consumer payments (DCPC) with 
estimates of aggregate personal disposable 
income. Section VII concludes. </p>

<p>II. SURVEYS OF CONSUMER EXPENDITURES 
AND PAYMENTS </p>

<p>The success of measuring consumer economic 
behavior depends crucially on the design and 
implementation of the survey instrument(s) used 
to collect the data. This section compares lead-
ing U.S. surveys that measure consumer expen-
ditures or payments and focuses on three issues 
identified by Crossley and Winter (2015): (1) sur-
vey modes; (2) methods of data collection (recall 
versus recording); and (3) the scope and aggre-
gation of expenditure categories. It also briefly 
addresses other issues cited by Crossley and Win-
ter: the format of questions, response unit of the 
survey, reference period of measurement, role of 
incentives, and the strategy for reducing or cor-
recting response errors in real time. </p>

<p>A. Overview of Surveys </p>

<p>Table 1 provides details of the U.S. surveys, 
two of which include a diary survey ("diary" 
for short), listed in chronological order of ori-
gin. Rows are grouped into sections with infor-
mation about questionnaires, measurement, and 
sampling. Four sponsors collect data for disparate 
reasons: </p>

<p>• U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)-
The BLS sponsors the CE, which "consists of two 
surveys-the quarterly interview survey and the 
diary survey-that provide information on the 
buying habits of American consumers, including 
data on their expenditures, income, and consumer 
unit (families and single consumers) character-
istics." 4 "As in the past, the regular revision of 
the Consumer Price Index (CPI) remains a pri-
mary reason for undertaking the Bureau's exten-
sive CE. Results of the CE are used to select 
new 'market baskets' of goods and services for 
the index, to determine the relative importance of 
components, and to derive cost weights for the 
market baskets." 5 
• Federal Reserve Board -The Board spon-
sors the SCF, which "is normally a triennial 
cross-sectional survey of U.S. families. The sur-
vey data include information on families' bal-
ance sheets, pensions, income, and demographic 
characteristics. Information is also included from 
related surveys of pension providers and the 
earlier such surveys conducted by the Federal </p>

<p>Reserve Board." 6 Although it does not collect all 
consumer expenditures directly, the SCF can be 
used to derive an estimate of total expenditures 
from estimates of income and wealth, and it does 
collect some expenditure data directly. 7 
• RAND Corporation-RAND sponsors the 
monthly FCS, which are "dedicated to tracking 
the effects of the financial crisis and great reces-
sion on American households" by collecting data 
on consumer expenditures, balance sheets, labor 
market conditions, expectations, and other vari-
ables (for more details, see Hurd and Rohwedder  2010). 
• Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (Boston 
Fed)-The Boston Fed sponsors the annual 
SCPC and the occasional DCPC, which measure 
consumer adoption of payment instruments and 
deposit accounts and use of instruments. Origi-
nally, the SCPC and DCPC were not integrated 
like the CE but were developed independently 
and are now being integrated. The SCPC collects 
only the number of payments, while the DCPC 
also tracks the dollar values. Both provide data 
on cash and (in later years) checking accounts 
and revolving credit; the SCPC contains limited 
information about household balance sheets. </p>

<p>The CE surveys are oldest, having been in 
continual use since 1980, while the SCF began in 
1983. 8 The other surveys are more recent, having 
originated in the wake of the financial crisis in 
2008. Although each survey except the SCPC 
collects data on the dollar value of consumer 
spending, the motivation varies across surveys, 
so they should not be expected to produce the 
same type or value of estimates. To the extent 
possible, this article focuses on comparisons of 
similar types of consumer spending. </p>

<p>B. Questionnaires </p>

<p>The unit of observation (or measurement) for 
diaries (CE-D and DCPC) is a consumer, while 
surveys also ask questions pertaining to the 
entire household. Ideally, spending data would 
be collected for each individual consumer within 
a household and for joint household expendi-
tures from the most reliable data source-in 
other words, by conducting a "census" of </p>

<p>6. See https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/ 
aboutscf.htm. 
7. For more details about the SCF, see http://www 
.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/scfindex.htm. 
8. The CE originally began in the 1800s and was imple-
mented about every 10 years until 1980. For more details, see 
https://www.bls.gov/cex/ceturnsthirty.htm. </p>

<p>households-which would enable accurate 
measurement of intra-household spending and 
transfers. While preferable in most cases, this 
ideal approach is more time-consuming and 
expensive than measuring randomly selected 
individuals, but it may yield better representation 
of households and more-accurate estimates of 
joint household expenditures than surveying 
random individuals. The DCPC observes only 
spending for individual consumers, to mini-
mize costs. Also, some payment behavior, such 
as cash spending, is relatively difficult for a 
respondent-even the "head of household" to 
report accurately on behalf of other household 
members to come up with an accurate estimate 
for the entire household. 
The mode and method of collecting data also 
differs between diaries and surveys. Survey ques-
tionnaires rely primarily on respondent recall to 
answer retrospective questions about spending. 
The CE-S and SCF conduct interview surveys, so 
respondents have assistance in interpreting ques-
tions, whereas the FCS and SCPC use unaided, 
Internet-based, online questionnaires, which may 
be susceptible to more recall and measurement 
(misinterpretation) errors despite being shorter 
and more convenient. In contrast, the diaries (CE-
D and DCPC) use memory aids to collect data 
based on daily recording of spending, supple-
mented by an interview (CE-D) and Internet sur-
vey (DCPC). Both diaries use paper memory aids, 
but the DCPC offers multiple options: a long-
form or short-form paper memory aid, receipt 
bag, or other method comfortable for the respon-
dent. 9 No consensus has emerged on the rela-
tive benefits of the modes and methods of data 
collection. Bee, Meyer, and Sullivan (2015) con-
clude that the CE-S interview survey performs 
better than the CE-D recording, but the National 
Academy of Science's committee on redesigning 
the CE thinks the diary recording is better and 
recommended expanding its use in the CE prod-
ucts (Dillmon and House 2013). 
Respondent burden is generally lower for 
the newer surveys (FCS, SCPC, and DCPC), 
which are shorter per survey and pay higher 
incentives on a per-minute basis. In particular, 
the SCF is relatively long and complex (and 
sometimes requires very high incentives), while 
the CE pays no incentive. The Internet sur-
veys and diaries tend to enjoy remarkably high </p>

<p>9. Foster (2016) shows that respondents are more likely 
to carry paper memory aids when given financial incentives, 
but the number of payments per datum was not statistically 
different for respondents who carried a paper memory aid. </p>



<p>ECONOMIC INQUIRY </p>

<p>participation, response, and retention rates, typi-
cally about 90% or better, perhaps because of the 
lower net burden. </p>

<p>C. Measurement </p>

<p>Most survey instruments measure expendi-
tures as the total dollar amount spent in a category 
of consumer goods and services. In contrast, the 
SCPC measures payments as the number of trans-
actions in a category of consumer goods and ser-
vices, while the DCPC measures the number and 
value of payments. A payment in the DCPC refers 
to the total dollar amount spent for one transac-
tion (or purchase), which may include multiple 
products (goods or services). For example, the 
total bill for all items in a grocery cart purchased 
during one shopping trip to the store includes 50 
grocery items, but it counts for only one pay-
ment in the groceries expenditure category. Sur-
veys that measure expenditures generally do not 
track payments. 
Another distinction between expenditures 
and payments is related to the unit of measure 
in surveys versus diaries. Surveys (CE-S, SCF, 
FCS, and SCPC) obtain estimates of total expen-
ditures or payments in an entire expenditures 
category summed over all items purchased or 
payments made. This method may involve sum-
mation errors (mathematical computation) or 
recall errors (omission of items and payments) 
over products and payments or over time, and 
thus may underestimate aggregate expenditures 
and payments in a category. 10 In contrast, diaries 
(CE-D and DCPC) obtain estimates for each indi-
vidual product (CE-D) or payment (DCPC) in a 
category and thus track an essentially unlimited 
number of entries within categories. This latter 
point illustrates the fact that the DCPC measures 
spending at a higher level of aggregation than 
the CE-D (payment versus product). These fac-
tors are interrelated with expenditure category 
definitions, which are discussed in detail later. 
The period during which consumer spending 
is measured also influences the quality of the 
data, and period differences are related to meth-
ods of data collection. CE-S measures spend-
ing that occurred during a "usual" or "typical" 
time period, which varies across surveys from 1 
week to 1 year. 11 Presumably, longer periods of </p>

<p>10. For examples of this phenomenon applied to con-
sumption expenditures, see Dillmon and House (2013, 5, 77,  and following) and Gibson and Kim (2007). 
11. The adjectives "usual" and "typical" may also evoke 
different responses. Angrisani, Kaptyen, and Schuh (2015)   recall involve greater recall (memory) errors for 
expenditures. 12 The CE-S and FCS give respon-
dents a specific time period (usually a month or 
quarter), whereas the SCPC allows respondents 
to choose their own time period (week, month, 
or year), depending on the payment situation. 
While daily recording in the diaries (CE-D and 
DCPC) likely reduces recall error, some recall is 
required even for diaries. The DCPC respondents 
perform their own data entry in an online survey 
each night, which entails recall unless they used 
a memory aid, and some questions in the DCPC 
Internet questionnaire also require other types 
of recall. However, results from the 2010-2011 
pilot DCPC show no evidence of statistically or 
economically significant data-entry errors (Foster  2016). 
Finally, all surveys and diaries include some 
strategies to reduce reporting errors in real time. 
Surveys with interviews provide the opportunity 
for interviewers to verify answers or to answer 
respondent questions, both of which may reduce 
errors. Internet surveys include various types of 
automated range checks, arithmetic verification, 
and other types of screen checks in anticipation 
of erroneous answers. Respondents are prompted 
to reanswer or correct their answers, but unaided 
Internet surveys may not be as effective as inter-
views in reducing errors. 
The precise methodology of collecting con-
sumer spending data determines the ultimate suc-
cess of measurement. Exhibits A1-A4 provide 
snapshots of the data collection techniques from 
the four main surveys that collect the dollar-value 
spending data studied in this article. Two are 
recall-based surveys (CE-S and FCS), and two 
are recording-based diaries (CE-D and DCPC). 
The exhibits illustrate the measurement charac-
teristics described in Table 1. </p>

<p>D. Sampling </p>

sured by "specific" (day, week, or month) versus "typical" 
periods. 
12. However, measuring the number of infrequent pay-
ments at lower frequencies in the SCPC can avoid mea-
surement errors due to rounding at higher frequencies. For 
example, reporting at a point in time for the entire month, one 
check payment per month is about 0.25 checks per week, so 
0 per week = 0 per month, while, reporting at a point in time 
for a week, 1 per payment week = 4 per month. </p>

<p>surveys (FCS, SCPC, and DCPC), which limit 
the population to adult consumers ages 18 years 
and older, they all target the total noninstitu-
tional population. However, sampling frames 
and sample sizes differ substantially, which 
affects the relative accuracy and efficiency of the 
national estimates. 
The older surveys and diary have larger sam-
pling frames and samples. The CE frame is the 
Census Bureau's Master Address File, which 
contains information on essentially all U.S. 
residents and is likely the most comprehensive 
list available. Other surveys and diaries rely on 
much smaller frames that have been selected 
from the U.S. population. The SCF frame from 
the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) 
is the largest, at about three million households, 
covering about 99% of the population, and 
is supplemented by IRS administrative data 
on high-income households. The actual sam-
ples drawn from these frames number about 
6,000-7,000 individuals or households. The 
size and representativeness of these frames and 
samples are advantages that may be offset by 
relatively high costs and lower response rates. 
In contrast, the newer surveys and diary have 
much smaller sampling frames and samples. For 
these newer surveys, the sampling frames are 
"Internet panels" of respondents who agree to 
take surveys regularly over time. As described in 
Hays, Liu, and Kapteyn (2015), Internet panels 
may be constructed as convenience samples or 
may be probability based and representative of 
the target population. In the latter case, they are 
usually drawn by random digit dialing (RDD) 
or address-based sampling (ABS). The main 
Internet panels are RAND Corporation's Amer-
ican Life Panel (ALP) and the University of 
Southern California's Understanding America 
Study (UAS), each of which contains about 
6,000 respondents. The ALP includes conve-
nience and probability samples, while the UAS 
is an ABS sample only. Actual samples drawn 
from these frames are roughly one-third as large 
(2,000-2,500) as the other samples. 
Internet panels have relatively low costs, very 
high response rates, and generally good qual-
ity data, but their size and construction raise 
concerns about representativeness. One concern 
is the use of convenience samples and RDD 
methods using landline telephones that are no 
longer universal. Another (waning) concern is 
that some consumers may have limited access 
to, or experience with, information technology, 
although panel vendors take steps to address this </p>

<p>constraint by giving respondents computers or 
tablets and training. A third concern is poten-
tial sample selection bias, of which there may 
be multiple types. The most troublesome type of 
selection bias is one that occurs when panelists 
are not representative due to unobservable char-
acteristics at the time of their selection. Other 
types of selection bias are observable, such as 
the finding in Heffetz and Rabin (2013) that sur-
vey respondents who are easy to reach (i.e., who 
readily agree to participate with few invitations) 
report different degrees of subjective happiness 
cooperation than respondents who are harder to 
reach (require many invitations). The ALP con-
tains some members who agreed to join when 
solicited after having participated once in the 
Michigan Survey of Consumers; roughly half 
agreed, and these members may have been easier 
to reach than the half who did not. Finally, selec-
tion effects may develop from learning and expe-
rience that occurs during repeated survey-taking 
over time, as in the SCPC (multiple years of 
annual surveys) and DCPC (3 consecutive days). 
As a counterpoint to concerns about selection, 
Gutsche and Weerman (2013) argue that "prac-
ticing involved panel management techniques" 
makes Internet access panels more successful in 
measuring economic behavior, as exhibited by 
higher rates of participation and response as well 
as greater diligence in participating and respond-
ing to questionnaires. 
For reasons described earlier, an additional 
concern may arise with estimation of U.S. 
consumer spending using samples of respon-
dents that are not drawn from representative 
households or do not contain all individual 
consumers within each household. In theory, 
consumer-based statistical sampling could pro-
duce unbiased estimates of U.S. spending, 
provided that: (1) consumers are randomly 
selected and sufficiently representative of all 
consumers within U.S. households and (2) 
consumer spending within households is uncor-
related across consumers. Unfortunately, neither 
condition likely holds in the Boston Fed surveys. 
Hitczenko (2015b) found that the SCPC has a dis-
proportionately large number of consumers with 
relatively high financial responsibility within 
their households, which may bias estimates of 
the number of payments upward by about 10%. 
Furthermore, household spending is most likely 
correlated across consumers within households 
for various reasons, such as shared expenses 
(rent or utilities) and similar preferences. DCPC 
respondents are asked to report only their own </p>



<p>ECONOMIC INQUIRY </p>

<p>payments, but failure to do so would cause 
measurement error. Some payments may occur 
strictly between consumers within households 
and thus may not be recorded properly. 13  Despite potential sampling limitations and 
obvious room for improvements, the DCPC 
produces reasonably reliable estimates of U.S. 
activity. Table 2 reports demographic character-
istics and selected economic statistics for the 
DCPC and compares them to reliable benchmark 
estimates (mostly the Current Population Survey, 
CPS). The 2012 DCPC-weighted estimates of 
demographic shares of consumers do not exhibit 
major differences from their benchmarks, and 
U.S. estimates of selected economic variables 
are encouraging. The employment-to-population 
ratio differs by less than 1 percentage point 
from its benchmark, as does the rate of adop-
tion of checking accounts; the median primary 
home price differs by only about 10%; and 
average payment-card transaction values are 
relatively close. These results lend credibility to 
the consumer spending estimates reported later. </p>

<p>E. Expenditure Categories </p>

<p>The definition of expenditure categories 
impacts the measurement of consumer spending 
in at least two ways. First, the scope of 
expenditures included influences spending 
estimates, with broader definitions that include 
more types of expenditures on goods and services 
likely to produce higher estimates. Second, the 
level of aggregation across products influences 
spending estimates, with more distinct subcat-
egories and products likely to produce higher 
estimates-provided disaggregation does not 
reduce coverage within categories. 
Table 3 reports the number of subcategories 
within each of nine relatively homogeneous 
expenditures categories for the two surveys (CE-
S and FCS) and diaries (CE-D and DCPC). 14 All </p>

<p>13. The SCPC and DCPC include a relative small sub-
sample of adults living in the same household that can be used 
to characterize some of these issues. See Hitczenko (2015b,  2016) for examples of research on within-household payment 
choices based on this subsample. 
14. See the Appendix for a full list of the 45 detailed 
"merchant" categories in the DCPC. These categories were 
defined in part to reflect the standard consumer expenditure 
categories. However, they were also designed to match unique 
and detailed (3-or 4-digit level) NAICS industry categories, 
for two reasons. First, unique identification of data by industry 
category permits benchmark comparisons with other data that 
are also organized by NAICS industry. Second, research on 
payment choices takes into account the nature of the payee 
in studying consumer demand for payment instruments, so it </p>

<p>estimates of spending on each product (CE-D) or 
payment (DCPC). Instead, the number of expen-
diture subcategories is relevant for respondent 
classification of expenditures or payments, with 
more subcategories providing more flexibility 
for respondents to classify their expenditures 
and payments. 
Among surveys, the CE-S has many more 
subcategories than the FCS (429 versus 45). 15  If precision is lost in aggregation, then the CE-
S (with more subcategories) might obtain more 
accurate estimates than the FCS. However, this 
supposition assumes that the detailed CE-S cat-
egories provide an exhaustive decomposition of 
more aggregate categories, which may not be cor-
rect. For example, Exhibit A3 (the CE-S food 
questionnaire) shows that the CE-S subcategories 
are often very narrow, such as cigarettes, a very 
specific product comparable to items in the CE-
D, but this same survey does not ask for other 
detailed products or subcategories of products 
similar to cigarettes. However, there is some over-
lap among CE-S subcategories, such as "grocery 
shopping" and a follow-up question about the 
subset of nonfood expenses in grocery shopping, 
so the net effect of each category's disaggregation 
on measurement is uncertain. 
Among diaries, the CE-D has many more cat-
egories than the DCPC (261-45). However, the </p>

<p>15. The FCS expenditure categories are similar to those 
in the Consumption and Activities Mail Survey (CAMS), 
produced by the University of Michigan. For more infor-
mation about the 2013 CAMS, see http://hrsonline.isr.umich 
.edu/index.php?p=shoavail&amp;iyear=9F. </p>

<p>number of categories is less important for diaries 
because they record an essentially unlimited 
number of expenditures or payments within each 
subcategory. Still, respondents use expenditure 
categories to classify expenditures or payments, 
so having more categories can help respondents 
find the "right" classification, although it may 
also increase respondent burden (time and com-
plexity). The DCPC has fewer categories than 
the CE-D because payments often contain a 
broad range of heterogeneous individual prod-
ucts, such as items sold by general merchandise 
stores (Walmart or Target), so it is difficult for 
respondents to choose one category for the entire 
shopping basket. Although expenditure cate-
gories may affect respondents' classification of 
spending, they likely do not affect respondents' 
recording of the actual value of payments. 
Tracking essentially unlimited numbers of 
expenditures or payments within a category gives 
diaries an important advantage over surveys. 
Universal coverage (inclusion) of all products or 
payments enables diaries to measure a greater 
proportion of total consumer spending, and may 
possibly facilitate more accurate estimates as 
well. However, over the course of a month, the 
number of products purchased by consumers 
(perhaps hundreds per month) is far greater than 
the number of payments made by consumers 
(about 60). Therefore, the CE-D imposes a much 
higher respondent burden to record product 
details than the DCPC imposes on respondents to 
record payments (to see this, compare the CE-D 
and DCPC memory aids in Exhibits A1 and </p>



<p>ECONOMIC INQUIRY </p>

<p>A2). The CE-D might underestimate consumer 
spending by missing some products, whereas 
the DCPC is more likely to record essentially 
all payments and thus estimate total spending 
more accurately. </p>

<p>F. Relation to Similar Data Sources </p>

<p>In recent years, the frontier of collecting con-
sumer expenditure data has expanded to include 
an array of electronic-based methods that tap into 
databases of transactions from financial institu-
tions and merchants. Survey and diary estimates 
of consumer spending are closely related to these 
electronic transactions data. The DCPC, in par-
ticular, contains essentially the same information 
but offers additional advantages and could be 
combined with transactions data to produce even 
better measures. </p>

<p>Financial Records. Most spending by consumers 
is tracked in electronic account transaction 
records from their depository institutions (banks 
and such) and other financial institutions, includ-
ing nonbanks (such as PayPal). Checking 
accounts track payments by debit card, check, 
online banking BPs, and bank account number 
payments, as well as cash withdrawals (although 
not cash payments). Banks also record credit 
card payments, although consumers often may 
hold credit cards from a bank different from the 
one where they have their checking account. 
Like the DCPC, these transactions data include 
identification of the payee (such as a merchant) 
in a classification system, but they do not reveal 
the specific products purchased during the trans-
action. Overall, the DCPC obtains essentially 
the same information contained in the records 
of a checking or credit card account, albeit with 
potential errors from consumer reporting. 
When consumers have multiple accounts at 
different financial institutions or use cutting-
edge payment instruments such as checks written 
against a home equity line of credit, collecting 
financial transactions data in a manner that 
ensures coverage of all transactions is more diffi-
cult. Personal financial management (PFM) tools 
(also called "data aggregators") have emerged, 
making it easier to collect disparate financial 
transactions data by utilizing electronic "back-
end" processing platforms that interface with 
financial institutions and populate consumer data 
into software or mobile apps. To a degree, the 
DCPC obtains data similar to that gathered by 
PFMs, except that the DCPC does not collect </p>

<p>much household financial data beyond payments 
and deposit accounts. However, PFM data may 
not be representative of the finances of U.S. 
consumers. The 2015 SCPC reveals that only 
7% of consumers have PFM tools, which often 
require consumers to give permission and confi-
dential information (such as passwords) to third 
parties for data access, raising questions about 
selection bias. 
Although transactions data from financial 
institutions are very difficult to obtain due to 
their proprietary nature and privacy concerns, 
some of these data have been obtained and 
used in research. Ganong and Noel (2016) use 
bank account data from the JPMorgan Chase 
Institute. 16 Agarwal et al. (2015) use a "unique 
panel database on the near universe of credit card 
accounts held by the eight largest U.S. banks" 
(p. 2). And Stango and Zinman (2009) use data 
from Lightspeed, a company that solicits per-
mission from consumers to access their financial 
accounts. Other research has obtained data from 
PFM tools: Baker (2016) uses Intuit's Mint 
.com, Gelman et al. (2014) use <rs type="software">Check Me</rs>, Pagel 
and Vardardottir (2016) use data from Iceland's 
<rs type="software">Meniga</rs>, and Gelman et al. (2016) use a financial 
aggregator and BP software from an unidentified 
mobile app. Government regulators, such as the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have 
used supervisory authority to obtain financial 
transaction data for research and policy analysis 
(see Bakker et al. 2014). </p>

<p>Retail Scanner Data. The retail sales portion of 
consumer spending is tracked by scanner data 
collected at electronic cash registers. Like the 
CE-D data, retail scanner data contain rich details 
about the value of products purchased (quantities 
and per-unit prices). Often these data also include 
the payment method, making them comparable to 
the DCPC data as well. Retail scanner datasets are 
very large because they track spending continu-
ously and can provide detailed geographic infor-
mation for retail chains with multiple stores. 
However, retail scanner data have two key lim-
itations. One is the scope of expenditures. Klee  (2008) uses data from a grocery store, and Wang 
and Wolman (2016) use data from a national dis-
count store. Another, more important limitation 
is that most retail scanner datasets do not contain 
information about the specific consumer making </p>

<p>16. See Data Assets at the JPMorgan Chase Institute: 
https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/institute/our-
data.htm. </p>

<p>SCHUH: PAYMENT DIARIES </p>



<p>the transaction. This anonymity makes scanner 
data less confidential and more accessible than 
financial records, but it greatly limits inference 
about the relationship of consumer characteristics 
to spending and identification of customers who 
are not consumers (such as businesses). Thus, 
research with retail scanner data must use average 
consumer characteristics by geographic region 
instead. However, some retail scanner datasets 
are supplemented by surveys of consumers who 
re-scan their products at home and provide infor-
mation about themselves for use in research, as in 
Cohen and Rysman (2013). </p>

<p>Advantages of the DCPC. The data sources 
for consumer expenditures or payments have 
many similarities. Each has its own particular 
strengths, but the DCPC offers several advan-
tages over the financial and retail alternatives, 
and overall the DCPC dataset provides generally 
better estimates of total consumer spending. 
For one thing, the DCPC data are drawn from 
samples that are more representative of U.S. 
consumers than the samples that are drawn from 
the alternative data discussed in this article. 
Also, by tracking all consumer payments, the 
DCPC dataset includes spending from a more 
comprehensive set of underlying liquid asset 
and liability accounts from which each individ-
ual consumer's (or household's) payments are 
drawn, even compared with PFM data. 
For any particular payment account, the 
DCPC also offers more detailed information 
about consumer spending. For example, bank 
checking accounts include data on cash with-
drawals but not cash payments, whereas the 
DCPC has both. Also, each DCPC payment is 
recorded electronically and followed by a "mini 
survey" about a range of important details con-
cerning that specific transaction, providing much 
more information and hence allowing more flex-
ibility in the approach to measuring consumer 
economic behavior. For each payment, the DCPC 
obtains more detailed or precise information 
about the types of consumer products purchased 
from each payee, the characteristics of the payees 
(name, business, payment acceptance, and cash 
discounting), the characteristics of the consumers 
(cash in wallet, carrying of payment cards), and 
consumers' attitudes (payment preferences, 
reasons for spending, financing decisions). 
Finally, the DCPC dataset enables more 
flexibility and applicability than alternative 
data sources, which are essentially provided 
"as is." The DCPC can be used to conduct </p>

<p>field experiments that measure differences in 
consumer behavior resulting from differences 
between control and trial groups, such as the 
information known to consumers in each group 
before making decisions. The DCPC can also be 
used to measure the specific effects of natural 
experiments, such as randomized tax rebates or 
hurricanes, on consumer behavior. Perhaps most 
importantly, payment diaries produce data with 
strong consistency between micro and macro 
estimates, which is lacking in prior research with 
other data sources. 
It is important to point out that the choice of 
data source on consumer spending does not have 
to be mutually exclusive. Each one has relative 
advantages that, if combined, could produce 
more and better data on consumer spending col-
lectively, as in the case of supplementing scanner 
data with surveys (Cohen and Rysman 2013). 
Furthermore, the use of PFM tools integrated 
with surveys or diaries also could improve data 
quality, or the PFM tools could be used instead of 
surveys and diaries for consumers who already 
have them to reduce costs and respondent bur-
den. Likewise, scanner data could replace diary 
recording for some types of transactions. These 
and other improvements in data collection may 
be worth pursuing, but they are outside the 
scope of the current article and reserved for 
future research. </p>

<p>III. MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE 2012 DCPC </p>

<p>A. Background </p>

<p>Electronic networks emerged in the 1970s 
and facilitated a transformation of money and 
payments from being paper-based (currency and 
checks) to being based on electronic payment 
means. Visa replaced its paper receipt system 
for credit cards with electronic card processing 
in 1974 and MasterCard followed shortly there-
after. 17 The Electronic Funds Transfer Act of 
1978 facilitated electronic payments from bank 
accounts and established a centralized Auto-
mated Clearing House (ACH) network. ATM 
cards (1980s) turned into debit cards (1990s) 
when terminals at the POS in stores were con-
figured to accept PINs. 18 From 1995 to 2000, 
the aggregate number of paper checks cleared in 
the United States declined 3% annually (Gerdes   17. Evans and Schmalensee (2005, 74). 
18. Visa and MasterCard also created signature-based 
debit cards that did not require a PIN and provided short-term 
settlement credit similar to credit cards. </p>



<p>ECONOMIC INQUIRY </p>

<p>and Walton 2002), finally demonstrating that a 
long-predicted demise of checks had begun. 19  More recently, payments are made through online 
banking and the Internet, via cellular networks 
with mobile phones, and even exclusively on the 
Internet with private currencies like Bitcoin. 20  One response to this transformation of pay-
ments has been that central banks in certain 
industrial countries have begun to collect high-
quality data on payments. A leading example is 
the Federal Reserve Payment Study (FRPS), a tri-
ennial survey of financial institutions and other 
companies in the payments industry (see Fed-
eral Reserve 2013). However, the FRPS does not 
include cash (currency) and, until recently, was 
available only for the entire U.S. economy and 
did not identify payments by sector (household, 
business, and government). 21 Therefore, central 
banks also began collecting data on consumer 
payments and especially cash, for which there 
had been little or no data (see Bagnall et al.  2016). 22 Another motivation was the lack of sat-
isfactory data on consumer ownership and use 
of deposit accounts and payment instruments 
(see Schuh and Stavins 2009). While financial 
institutions, nonfinancial companies, and consul-
tants had lots of high-quality data on consumer 
payments, the data were typically proprietary 
or exceedingly costly. The limited amount of 
affordable data typically did not reveal or meet 
satisfactory standards of sampling and statisti-
cal analysis. The focus on consumer demand for 
payments was motivated by the need to estimate 
consumer welfare and determine the structure of 
an optimal electronic payment system and related 
policy implications. 
The Boston Fed's first contribution to data 
development was the SCPC, a 30-minute online 
questionnaire focused mainly on two concepts: 
(1) adoption of bank accounts and payment 
instruments (including cash holdings) and (2) 
recall-based use of payment instruments defined </p>

from nonhousehold accounts. See Federal Reserve (2013) for

<p>as the number of payments made with each 
instrument from those accounts. The SCPC has 
been implemented annually using the RAND 
Corporation's ALP from 2008 to 2014 and the 
University of Southern California's UAS from 
2014 onward. See Schuh and Stavins (2014) and 
Hitczenko (2015a) for more information about 
the 2012 SCPC. 23  Over time, it became apparent that collect-
ing the dollar value of payments was also an 
important part of understanding consumer pay-
ment choices. The previously discussed scan-
ner data and research revealed unconditional 
correlation between payment instrument choices 
and the dollar values of payments (which the 
SCPC does not collect). In retail payments, cash 
is used most often for small-value purchases, 
debit cards for medium-value purchases, and 
credit cards for larger-value purchases. Briglevics  and Schuh (2016) provide complementary evi-
dence for BPs and show how the payment choice 
correlation changes after conditioning on cash in 
the consumer's wallet at the time of purchase 
and the number of payments per day, using a 
dynamic structural model that extends Koulayev  et al. (2016). 
Consequently, the Boston Fed implemented 
the DCPC in 2012 to complement its annual 
SCPC, with assistance from the Richmond and 
San Francisco Federal Reserve Banks, and imple-
mented it with the ALP. 24 One key objective was 
to compare and contrast recall-based (SCPC) and 
recording-based (DCPC) estimates of the num-
ber of payments by payment instrument. A sec-
ond objective was to collect data on the dollar 
value of payments. The SCPC and DCPC are 
broadly similar to payment surveys and diaries 
fielded by other industrial countries, such as Aus-
tralia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, and the 
Netherlands (see Bagnall et al. 2016). A substan-
tially revised DCPC was implemented in the fall 
of 2015. </p>

questionnaire, data, and official results have not yet been 
published, but eventually they will be available at: http://www

<p>SCHUH: PAYMENT DIARIES </p>



<p>goal of the 2012 DCPC was to collect data on 
each separate value of every individual consumer 
payment authorized by payment instruments, 
plus the management of cash (notes, bills, and 
coins), which also is a payment instrument. In 
the online questionnaire, seven core variables 
are collected for each non-BP every day: time 
and date of payment, dollar amount, payment 
instrument, payment location, merchant type, 
and merchant name (see the "Daily Payments 
and Cash Activity" screen shot in Exhibit A2). 
Later, the DCPC online questionnaire also col-
lected recurring and occasional BPs using these 
standard entry boxes. Similar core variables were 
collected each night for cash holdings (in wallet, 
purse, or pocket) by currency denomination in 
a separate screen, as was all other cash manage-
ment activity (withdrawals, deposits, cash gifts 
received and given, and other cash activity). 
The 2012 DCPC also collected data on many 
other concepts that are less central to this paper 
and thus mentioned briefly here. These include 
consumer preferences over payment instruments, 
details of each specific payment opportunity 
(such as discounts received for cash payments or 
surcharges for credit cards), carrying of payment 
instruments, and other matters. </p>

<p>C. Diary Modes </p>

<p>The 2012 DCPC survey consisted of two 
modes. The first mode comprised a number of 
voluntary memory aids, and the second was 
an online questionnaire, including respondent 
entry of memory-aid data. Respondents were 
asked to use memory aids daily, to complete an 
online questionnaire each night, and to take a 
brief online survey the night before the diary 
began. Respondents were provided an instruc-
tional video of about 6 minutes with training 
materials on how to complete the diary. 
The first mode asked respondents to carry 
with them daily one or more of three memory 
aids provided by the survey vendor to track their 
payments and cash management. Two of these 
memory aids were paper diaries. The long form, 
eight pages (8.5 × 11 in.) folded in half, provided 
instructions, codes, and room to record 3 days of 
payment and cash activity. The short form was a 
checkbook-sized book of receipts that provided 
room to record the payment amount and a few 
details, but no instructions. The third memory 
aid was a canvas pouch for storing receipts from 
payment and cash activity. Respondents were 
urged strongly to carry one of these memory aids, 
but were allowed to choose their own alternative </p>

<p>(including no aid). About 53% of respondents 
carried one of the two paper memory aids (36% 
carried the short form and 26% the long). 
The second mode required respondents to 
complete each night an online questionnaire that 
took about 20 minutes per day and contained 
two main parts: (1) a daily payments module 
linked directly to the memory aids; and (2) 
other related questions that may not have been 
recorded in any memory aid and required daily 
recall or other record lookup. The daily pay-
ments module asked respondents to enter their 
data from the memory aids or recollection, while 
the remainder of the questionnaire collected 
other information pertaining to respondents' 
daily payments and cash management activity, 
including unrecorded details. </p>

<p>D. Diary Design </p>

<p>Initially, ALP members were recruited to par-
ticipate in both the 2012 SCPC (designed to take 
approximately 30 minutes, for a $20 incentive) 
and the 2012 DCPC (designed to take approxi-
mately 20 minutes per day for 3 days, for a $60 
total incentive). About 95% of invited members 
who agreed took both the SCPC and DCPC, 
and many respondents had also completed the 
SCPC in prior years (2008-2011). After agreeing 
to participate, respondents were asked to com-
plete the SCPC before the DCPC, and about 85% 
did (compared with about 70% within 10 days 
in prior years); the median completion time was 
37 minutes. Most respondents who did not com-
plete the diary were assigned a diary period 
early in the month of October and had less time 
than the other respondents between the launch 
of the SCPC (mid-September) and the DCPC 
(September 29). The remaining respondents were 
allowed to complete the SCPC at their earliest 
convenience, and the vast majority completed the 
DCPC by early November. 
Respondents were asked to participate for 
3 consecutive days during the one out of 31 
waves to which they were randomly assigned 
throughout October (between September 29 and 
November 2), and to complete a brief (less-
than-5-minute) online survey the night before the 
diary, primarily to obtain estimates of their cash 
balances at the start of the diary. Diary partic-
ipants who successfully completed all 2 days 
of their online questionnaires (91% of selected 
ALP members) received their incentive payment 
($20 per day). The median completion time for 
the online DCPC daily questionnaire was about 
13 minutes (the range was 10 minutes for Day 2 to </p>



<p>ECONOMIC INQUIRY </p>

<p>15 minutes for Day 1), so the incentive also com-
pensated respondents for time spent watching 
the video, reading and maintaining their memory 
aid(s), checking their records (if they did), and 
performing other related tasks. </p>

<p>E. Sampling Methodology and Implementation </p>

<p>The 2012 DCPC sample selection procedure 
was complicated by the joint selection of respon-
dents who would complete both the SCPC and 
DCPC, and by the existing structure of the lon-
gitudinal SCPC sample. As of 2011, the un-
weighted SCPC longitudinal panel was not very 
representative of the U.S. population; for more 
details, see Hitczenko (2015a) and Angrisani,  Foster, and Hitczenko (2014, forthcoming). Con-
sequently, the 2012 SCPC and DCPC samples 
were drawn to increase respondents in under-
represented strata and to improve representative-
ness of the un-weighted samples. This decision 
reduced the pool of longitudinal panelists in the 
SCPC somewhat, but it also reduced the variation 
of the weights used ex post to stratify the samples. 
From the ALP sampling frame of nearly 
6,000 members, 2,601 respondents completed 
the 2012 DCPC. After excluding respondents 
with incomplete or unreliable diary data, the final 
dataset contained data from 2,468 respondents. 
The DCPC participants were selected randomly 
from the ALP frame to match population shares 
(measured by the CPS) of strata defined by 
three demographic variables: three age cat-
egories (19-39, 40-55, 65+), three income 
categories (&lt;$30k, $30-59k, $65k+), and two 
categories of race (white, nonwhite). 
Daily sampling occurred as follows. Each day 
from September 29 through October 31, about 
75 respondents were randomly selected to begin 
a 3-day diary, forming 33 overlapping waves of 
about 225 respondents, as shown in Figure A1. 
Thus, each day during October 1-31 about one-
third of respondents completed one diary day for 
each of the 3 days. In addition to aiming to pro-
duce representative samples each day, the sam-
pling strategy and design help to reduce daily 
seasonal effects that might arise from system-
atic differences in diary performance across diary 
days 1-3, such as diary fatigue (declining partic-
ipation rates, item response rates, or data quality 
over the diary period), learning effects (improve-
ments in data reporting over time), and strategic 
shirking (such as advancing or postponing pay-
ments to reduce reporting burden). 
Overall, the random assignment of diarists 
worked reasonably well to ensure proper </p>

<p>assignment of selected panelists to their official 
diary periods, despite a significant administrative 
burden. Figure A2 shows that the number of 
diarists fluctuated between about 200 and 250 
per day in most of October, and the startup and 
showdown periods worked as expected. The 
number of panelists who failed to participate in 
the exact days of their official diary period was 
relatively low: at least 87% logged in to complete 
their online survey by the first day, although it 
is not possible to determine how many of the 
respondents who logged in for the first time after 
the first day were reporting data for a period 
other than the one for which they were assigned. 
Efforts were made to accommodate respondents 
who requested date changes or dropped out 
entirely by replacing them with alternates of 
similar demographic characteristics, to maintain 
maximum possible representativeness. </p>

<p>F. Aggregation </p>

<p>The DCPC sampling design and implementa-
tion produce an important statistical benefit that 
contributes to the diary's success in estimating 
aggregate consumer expenditures. Although each 
diarist provides only 3 days of longitudinal data 
for part of the month, the representative sam-
pling is designed to produce a weighted sum 
of payments that is expected to equal total U.S. 
payments (for consumers ages 18 and older) in 
October 2012. 
To see this result quantitatively, it is necessary 
to introduce some notation and algebra. Let p igkdt 
and q igkdt denote the per-unit price and quantity, 
respectively, of good or service g = {1, … , G} 
by consumer i = {1, … , N} at payment 
opportunity (location) k = {1, … , K} on day 
d = {1, … , D t } of time period (month) t (in this 
case, October 2012). Then, consumer expendi-
tures for a single payment opportunity k are </p>

<p>x ikdt = 
( 
1 + τ </p>

<p>C 
kdt </p>

<p>) ∑ </p>

<p>g∈k </p>

<p>p gikdt q gikdt </p>

<p>where τ </p>

<p>C 
kdt </p>

<p>is the (consumption) sales tax rate. The 
payment opportunity may represent one product 
(g k = 1), like a cup of coffee, or many products 
(G k &gt; 1), like a shopping basket full of groceries. 
In contrast, the CE-D tracks individual goods and 
services rather than payment opportunities and 
thus estimates product expenditures: </p>

<p>x igdt = 
( 
1 + τ </p>

<p>C 
kdt </p>

<p>) ∑ </p>

<p>k </p>

<p>p gikdt q gikdt . </p>

<p>SCHUH: PAYMENT DIARIES </p>



<p>In general, the number of goods exceeds the 
number of payment opportunities (G &gt; K), which 
may have implications for the quality of measure-
ment of consumer expenditures. Note that neither 
the DCPC nor the CE-D obtains estimates of p 
or q individually. In any case, payments can be 
further distinguished by the payment instrument 
j used to purchase the goods and services at each 
location. Thus, a payment represents the dollar 
value of one basket of goods and services: </p>

<p>x ijkdt = Φ kdt (j) 
( 
1 + τ </p>

<p>C 
kdt </p>

<p>) ∑ </p>

<p>g∈k </p>

<p>p gikdt q gikdt </p>

<p>where Φ kdt is an indicator variable that takes a 
value of 1 when the consumer chooses payment 
instrument j to make the transaction. Now let 
w </p>

<p>m 
it </p>

<p>≥ 1 denote the monthly sampling weight for 
respondent i, which is based on the full sample of 
respondents for the month (independent of days) 
and does not depend on the payment instrument 
or opportunity. Then aggregate U.S. consumer 
payments are: </p>

<p>X t = 
∑ </p>

<p>i </p>

<p>∑ </p>

<p>j </p>

<p>∑ </p>

<p>k </p>

<p>∑ </p>

<p>d </p>

<p>w </p>

<p>m </p>

<p>it x ijkdt . </p>

<p>The monthly sampling weight is constructed 
for the entire diary sample and provides ex-post 
stratification of the sample results to match the 
U.S. population. Daily sampling weights, w </p>

<p>d 
idt </p>

<p>, 
can be constructed for each of the 31 days of the 
month using a different, but analogous, method-
ology based on the sample of respondents in each 
of the three diary waves active on that day. For 
more information about sampling and weighting, 
see the DCPC technical appendix by Angrisani,  Foster, and Hitczenko (forthcoming). </p>

<p>G. Summary of Key Results </p>

<p>In October 2012, consumer payments aver-
aged $124 per day with a range of $66-$300, 
as shown in Figure 1 (solid line), and repre-
senting an average of 1.9 payments per day 
(not plotted in the figure). The peak daily pay-
ment ($300) occurred on October 1 and was fol-
lowed by a steady decline during the first week 
of the month. After that, expenditures fluctu-
ated around a steady mean for the rest of the 
month until reaching their second highest level 
($186) on October 31. The volatility of daily pay-
ments and relatively small sample size yield stan-
dard errors (dashed lines in Figure 1) that pre-
vent identification of statistically significant dif-
ferences among days except for a few extreme 
values. </p>

<p>In contrast, lower-frequency estimates pro-
vide better inference about consumer spending at 
higher frequencies. The daily estimate of monthly 
payments per consumer (denoted by an over-
head bar), </p>

<p>X t,d = </p>

<p>d </p>

<p>∑ </p>

<p>s=1 </p>

<p>(31∕d) X st </p>

<p>is less volatile, as shown in Figure 2. 25 On Octo-
ber 31, the final estimate of monthly payments 
per consumer was $3,859. Multiplying this esti-
mate by 12 gives an annual estimate of con-
sumer payments of $46,308; multiplying again 
by an average of 2.04 adults per household 
gives annual household payments of $93,079. 
Although admittedly a "back-of-the-envelope" 
calculation, this estimate is notably similar to 
annual household income estimate of $87,200 
from the 2013 SCF. 26  The daily estimates of monthly consumer pay-
ments are potentially valuable for their relative 
timeliness and precision. Estimates early in the 
month are well above, and statistically signifi-
cantly different from, the final estimate, due to the 
seasonally high value on October 1. However, by 
October 10 the estimate was statistically insignif-
icantly different from the final estimate, and it 
stayed there for the rest of the month. Thus, the 
DCPC's daily estimate of cumulative consumer 
spending on October 2012 provided an unbiased 
estimate of its monthly consumer expenditures 
long before the end of the month. In contrast, offi-
cial government statistics on consumer spending, 
such as retail sales, are not available until after the 
end of the month and may be subject to revisions 
after their initial release. 
In addition to seasonal factors for days and 
weeks within October, the month of October 
itself may have a seasonal component that would 
affect inference about the full year, although 
October was chosen because it has modest 
seasonality. Hernandez, Jonker, and Zwaan 
(2016) report seasonal variation of up to about 
10% in Dutch payments for certain months, 
although their October seasonal is essentially 
zero. Furthermore, the U.S. Census Bureau's 
nominal retail sales had a seasonal factor of 
0.985 for October 2012 and 0.991 for the aver-
age October (on a base of 1.000), although retail </p>

<p>25. These estimates are constructed using the daily sam-
pling weights rather than the monthly weights.

<p>sales account for only about one-third of personal 
income and other consumer payments may have 
larger seasonal factors. 27 While the 2012 DCPC 
is unlikely to contain unusually high payments, 
October payments generally are not necessarily 
representative of other months or, when annual-
ized, actual annual payments, so more payments 
data and seasonal analysis are needed. </p>

<p>IV. THEORY AND MEASUREMENT </p>

<p>Measurement of consumer expenditures 
focuses on goods and services that are closely 
related to the economic concept of consumption, 
as is evident from the expenditure categories 
in Table 3. However, payment diaries track 
all spending and transfers by consumers, not 
just consumption expenditures. This section 
examines the theoretical relationship between 
consumer payments and expenditures, and </p>

<p>27. Seasonally adjusted and nonseasonally adjusted esti-
mates, from which seasonal factors can be calculated, are 
available at: https://www.census.gov/econ/currentdata/. </p>

<p>explains the practical measurement of both 
concepts in the DCPC. 
The analysis applies to individual consumers 
and thus abstracts from household composition, 
which may affect measurement. In multi-member 
households, consumers' individual incomes and 
expenditures may be correlated for various 
reasons and have implications for estimation 
of aggregate expenditures, as discussed in 
Section II. Thus, measurement requires data 
collection for all consumers in a household, 
or at least at the household level, which the 
DCPC does not do, so aggregate estimates may 
be biased. Nevertheless, the DCPC attempts 
to measure some of these correlations through 
methods discussed later in this section. </p>

<p>A. Theoretical Concepts </p>

<p>This section describes basic accounting iden-
tities for personal income and consumer pay-
ments, and shows the theoretical relationship 
between them to provide a simple framework 
for measurement. </p>

<p>SCHUH: PAYMENT DIARIES </p>



<p>FIGURE 2 
Daily Estimate of Monthly Payments per U.S. Consumer, October 2012 </p>

<p>Notes: Dashed lines indicate 95% confidence level; dotted line indicates the final mean. The daily estimate of monthly 
payments equals the 31-day projection of average daily payments derived from the cumulative sum of payments since October 
1, divided by the number of days (see formula in Section III.G). When calculating the standard errors for daily estimate of 
monthly payments, covariance across days becomes a factor. For the purposes of this figure, we assume that covariance across 
days only arises from the sample containing the same individuals for multiple days. Thus, if x t is the average daily payments on 
date t, we assume that Cov(x t , x k ) = 0 if t − k &gt; 2, because an individual is only present in the sample for a maximum of 3 days. 
For t − k ≤ 2, where covariance is not assumed to be zero, we use the sample covariance to calculate the standard errors.

<p>Personal Income. Consumers have three ways 
to allocate their personal income, denoted Y. 
The textbook equation for this distribution (or 
accounting) of income is </p>

<p>Y = C + T + S </p>

<p>where C denotes consumption of goods and ser-
vices, T denotes personal taxes, and S denotes 
personal saving (or the change in wealth). Sub-
scripts for individual consumers (i) and for time 
(t) are suppressed for simplicity. 28 Consumers 
make expenditures for consumption and taxes </p>

<p>28. In most macro data, the frequencies of income and 
its components are typically the same (monthly, quarterly, 
or annual). In micro data, such as the daily DCPC, it is 
necessary to account for different frequencies of income 
(weekly or bimonthly), taxes (quarterly or annual), and 
consumption (essentially continuous). However, aggregation 
of high-frequency micro data from the DCPC occurs over all 
consumers and days and thus all variables can be treated as 
having a homogeneous frequency (month). </p>

<p>(E = C + T). The remainder of income is saved 
for future expenditures (positive saving), or else 
assets and liabilities are used to finance expen-
ditures in excess of income (negative saving). In 
the aggregate and at low frequencies (such as 
a year) saving typically is positive, but at the 
individual consumer level and at high frequen-
cies (less than a month) negative saving may be 
more common. </p>

<p>Consumer Payments. Unlike income, there is no 
economic theory of payments, but the income 
accounting equation is a logical starting point 
is to use as a guideline. To begin, note that 
the income accounting identity abstracts from 
the practical fact that most consumer income 
is deposited infrequently into an account to be 
spent continually between the lumpy receipts of 
income. Consumers make most payments from 
their deposit accounts using payment instruments 
(including cash withdrawn from the accounts) </p>



<p>ECONOMIC INQUIRY </p>

<p>to fund their expenditures. 29 Thus, there is an 
implicit aggregation of payments over a rele-
vant time period implied in any relation between 
income and payments, although this detail is sup-
pressed for simplicity. 
Consumers have at least three ways to spend 
their income by making payments, denoted X: </p>

<p>X = X 
C + X 
T + X 
S . </p>

<p>Consumers make payments to buy consump-
tion goods and services, X C , to remit personal 
taxes, X T , or to make payments related to their 
management of savings, X S . Consumers make 
most payments directly themselves, from a pay-
ment (deposit) account or from another asset 
or liability, but sometimes payments are made 
by third parties on behalf of consumers, as 
described later. 
The components of the payment accounting 
identity differ somewhat from their analogues 
in the income accounting identity due to the 
nature of payment diaries. Like most CEs, pay-
ment diaries track total spending on consumption 
expenditures including sales and related taxes, 
which are not measured separately. Therefore, 
consumption payments are denoted by </p>

<p>X 
C = 
( 
1 + τ </p>

<p>C </p>

<p>) 
C </p>

<p>where τ C is the sales (consumption) tax rate, and 
tax payments are </p>

<p>X 
T = T − T 
C =T </p>

<p>where T C = τ c C represents sales taxes. Finally, 
saving-related payments represent only part of 
total saving: </p>

<p>X 
S = S −S. </p>

<p>Consumers make most saving-related pay-
ments two ways: (1) directly from consumers' 
income into asset or liability accounts other than 
their payment (deposit) accounts; or (2) by asset 
transfers from a payment (deposit) account to 
another asset or liability account. The latter pay-
ments are authorized using a payment instrument 
or other means of payment, such as an electronic 
account-to-account transfer via online banking. 30  Saving-related payments are funded by current </p>

<p>29. One exception is when payments are made directly 
from consumer incomes by their employer or other income 
provider on behalf of the consumer. These payments are 
called a "direct deduction from income" and discussed later. 
30. For simplicity, it is assumed that these transfers occur 
once per income period. But consumers can make multiple </p>

<p>income and affect net worth, and hence are part 
of total saving. The residual component of saving 
(S) represents all other changes in net worth that 
are not tracked by payments. 31 </p>

<p>Relation between Income and Payments. A com-
parison of the income and payment identities 
illustrates the relationship between them. The dif-
ference between income and payments is </p>

<p>Y − X = (C + T + S) − 
( 
X 
C + X 
T + X </p>

<p>S </p>

<p>) 
. </p>

<p>Assuming that all terms are measured prop-
erly, and using the saving identity above, the 
conceptual difference between income and pay-
ments is simply residual savings that are unre-
lated to payments, </p>

<p>Y − X =S </p>

<p>which can be positive or negative, like 
total saving. </p>

<p>B. Measurement Issues </p>

<p>The preceding discussion of theoretical con-
cepts assumes exact measurement of economic 
variables. In practice, however, measurement is 
challenging and never exact because it requires 
information or details that are unavailable and 
thus strong assumptions that may not be consis-
tent with reality. For these and related reasons, 
measurement of consumer expenditures using 
payments from the DCPC is likely to contain 
errors. In particular, the measurement of con-
sumer expenditures in the 2012 DCPC is less 
detailed than in other surveys, so this subsection 
provides a high-level summary of the broad con-
cepts and measurement issues. 
Several issues are important to highlight in 
evaluating measurement of income and pay-
ments. First, each of the data sources is measured 
differently, and estimates are denoted with a cir-
cumflex (hat). Thus,Ŷ denotes NIPA estimates 
of income (and its components), whileX denotes </p>

<p>saving-related payments within an income period, in which 
case the gross payments would have to be netted out appro-
priately. 
31. Two other savings-related types of payments may 
occur but are not usually covered in payment diaries and thus 
are excluded. One type is a pure asset or liability transfer that 
does not involve payment (deposit) accounts, such as between 
two investment or liability accounts; these account-to-account 
(A2A) transfers do not affect household net worth. Another 
type is a payment funded by an asset or liability for which 
there is no payment instrument to track. </p>

<p>SCHUH: PAYMENT DIARIES </p>



<p>DCPC estimates of payments. Naturally, each 
estimate has a composite error, </p>

<p>Y = Y − μ 
y andX = X − η </p>

<p>x </p>

<p>for one or more reasons, including classical mea-
surement error and sampling error. The compos-
ite errors are denoted by different Greek variables 
because income and payments are not measured 
identically and thus the types and magnitudes of 
the errors may be quite different. There is no rea-
son to expect that Corr(μ y , η x ) = 0 but the analyti-
cal form of correlation is difficult (or impossible) 
to derive, and it is hard to predict the sign or mag-
nitude observed in the data. 
Another important measurement issue is 
the extent to which the data estimates cover 
(include) all components of the theoretical con-
cepts ("coverage" for short). The main limitation 
of NIPA coverage is undocumented sources of 
expenditures and income, some of which may be 
captured by payment diaries. The main limita-
tion of DCPC coverage is the scope of consumer 
expenditures, which is essentially unlimited in 
the NIPA. The DCPC has at least two coverage 
limitations: (1) payments made by third parties 
on behalf of consumers are excluded and (2) BPs 
are not measured well. The remainder of this 
subsection describes these coverage limitations 
in more detail. </p>

<p>Undocumented Payments and Income. Although 
much effort is made to estimate all per-
sonal income, NIPA estimates ofŶ exclude 
undocumented expenditures and income called 
the "shadow economy" or "underground econ-
omy," μ y , which Schneider and Enste (2000)  reported to be 8%-10% of U.S. GDP. Shadow 
economic activity may include: (1) undocu-
mented production and sales of legal goods 
and services by firms that are not registered 
with the government, such as home-garage auto 
repairs or babysitting services, or do not report 
all sales and wages, perhaps to avoid taxation; 
and (2) criminal activity that avoids legal restric-
tions on production and sales, such as activities 
involving drugs or prostitution. These and other 
undocumented expenditures and income are not 
measured in the NIPA. 
However, consumers participating in the 
DCPC may have recorded payments for shadow 
economic activity due to the focus on measure-
ment by payment instrument rather than by type 
of expenditure or the payee's legal status or 
compliance. In particular, Humphrey, Kaloudis,   and Öwre (2004) reported that cash payments 
play an important role in the shadow economy 
but are not measured regularly. Although undoc-
umented expenditures are hard to estimate and 
the DCPC does not attempt to identify them 
directly, it is possible that recorded (denoted 
by subscript R) DCPC payments include docu-
mented and undocumented (subscripts D and U, 
respectively) consumption expenditures: </p>

<p>X C R =X C RD +X C RU . </p>

<p>All consumer tax payments are assumed to 
be documented (required by the government), 
soX T RU = 0 by assumption. However, con-
sumers may engage in undocumented saving 
activity like person-to-person (P2P) payments, 
which may include personal debt repayments 
(repaying a colleague for lunch), outright gifts 
to other persons, international remittance pay-
ments, and the like. Therefore, the DCPC 
likely includes documented and undocumented 
saving-related payments: </p>

<p>X S R =X S RD +X S RU . </p>

<p>Undocumented consumer payments may also 
occur within households. In some cases, within-
household payments may be expenditures shared 
by household members, for instance, for a share 
of an electric bill, which would pose measure-
ment problems if not identified separately from 
consumption expenditures made by other house-
hold members who actually pay the electric bill. 
Payments toward such shared bills may be cap-
tured by the DCPC in P2P payments, and could 
be removed in empirical analyses to avoid dou-
ble counting expenditures. 32 Other P2P payments 
within households may represent saving-related 
activity, such as an allowance given by a parent to 
a child or other gifts of assets. Such P2P payments 
underscore the importance of the discussion in 
Section II about the desirability of sampling 
and surveying all household members to prop-
erly measure all payments and produce unbiased 
household estimates of consumer spending. 
Undocumented expenditures have impli-
cations for the measurement of income and 
payments. Total undocumented expenditures, </p>

<p>32. In the DCPC and SCPC, consumers are asked to 
report only the BPs they made and not those made by other 
household members. However, it is not known how adults in 
multi-member households view and report their payment to a 
roommate for part of a shared bill, as opposed to paying the 
(electric) bill directly. </p>

<p>Including undocumented expenditures in 
the DCPC increases the likelihood that pay-
ments could exceed income, depending on the 
magnitude of undocumented expenditures and 
the extent to which the DCPC respondents 
report them. </p>

<p>Third-Party Payments. Total consumer pay-
ments include expenditures paid by consumers 
directly for themselves, which are recorded in 
the DCPC, and expenditures paid on behalf of 
consumers by third parties, such as employers, 
financial institutions, or governments, which 
are not recorded in the DCPC (denoted by 
subscript "N"). Thus, payments for consumer 
expenditures are </p>

<p>X 
C = X 
C R + X </p>

<p>C N </p>

<p>and likewise for X T and X S . Examples of X C N 
include various types of insurance (health or 
life), contributions to flexible spending accounts 
that pay for child care, and public transit passes. 
Examples of X T N include all kinds of federal, 
state, and local taxes withheld from income. 
And examples of X S N include employee-defined 
contributions to retirement accounts, loan repay-
ments, and direct deposits to an investment 
account. Some third-party payments are made 
automatically for consumers, such as standard 
employment benefits that do not require con-
sumers to choose them, while some third-party 
payments are optional and consumers willingly 
choose to direct third parties to make the pay-
ments, perhaps because it is more convenient 
than making the payments themselves. 
The DCPC asks respondents to record only 
payments that they make for themselves; it does 
not collect data on consumer payments made by 
third parties, soX C N =X T N =X S N = 0. Because 
third-party payments are widespread and quanti-
tatively large for most U.S. consumers, especially 
those made by employers, the DCPC excludes a 
relatively large portion of total consumer expen-
ditures and income by design. </p>

<p>The DCPC (or other payment diaries) could 
ask respondents to record third-party payments 
as well, or even to recall them approximately. 
The extent to which third-party expenditures are 
included in consumer spending estimates is deter-
mined by the content and methodology of the sur-
vey or diary used to collect them. For example, 
the SCPC clearly asks respondents to record 
employer-paid payments called "direct deduction 
from income." 33 But the 2012 DCPC did not 
ask respondents to report these third-party pay-
ments as clearly as did the SCPC, so respondents 
had to remember them without specific ques-
tions or prompting as to which one(s) should be 
included. Although this approach may have suc-
ceeded in recording some third-party consumer 
expenditures, it was likely not as successful as 
directly asking respondents to record third-party 
payments. However, asking respondents to report 
third-party expenditures may greatly increase 
respondent burden. </p>

<p>Bill Payments. Most payment diaries only col-
lect data on POS expenditures like retail pay-
ments, a practice that limits their coverage of 
consumer expenditures. Of the seven industrial 
country diaries in Bagnall et al. (2016), only the 
U.S. DCPC collected data on BPs like monthly 
utilities or loan repayments. However, the 2012 
DCPC appears to have been relatively unsuc-
cessful, estimating only eight BPs per consumer 
per month compared with 22 in the 2012 SCPC. 
While this gap warrants further examination and 
development of the collection of BP information, 
the inclusion of BPs in the DCPC unequivocally 
increases coverage of consumer expenditures rel-
ative to other payment diaries. 
BPs also pose measurement challenges 
because the total dollar values of some bills do 
not correspond exactly to consumption expen-
ditures. Payments like a monthly electricity bill 
correspond more or less exactly to actual con-
sumption expenditures. However, bills for loan 
payments contain a mix of expenditure types, 
requiring extra data collection and respondent 
burden to identify the components. A leading 
example is mortgage payments, which may 
include principal, interest, taxes, and various 
types of insurance (PITI). Loan repayment of the </p>

<p>33. Technically, these third-party payments from income 
are not defined by the SCPC and DCPC as an official payment 
instrument. However, they are authorizations of payment that 
would have been made with a payment instrument if the 
income had been deposited into the consumer's account and 
had been made directly by the consumer. </p>

<p>SCHUH: PAYMENT DIARIES </p>



<p>principal balance reduces a liability (debt) and 
therefore is saving. Naturally, the property tax 
portion of the loan repayment is consumer tax 
expenditure, but the remainder is related to con-
sumption expenditures. Only part of the interest 
payment is treated as consumption expenditure 
through a complicated formula in the details of 
national income accounting. 34 And most types 
of insurance payments are included in PCE 
as consumption. 
Another important example pertains to credit 
cards. Consumers who use a credit card to pay 
for consumption expenditures, such as groceries, 
gas, and clothes, and then pay off the entire 
balance of the credit card bill at the end of the 
month are called "convenience users" of credit 
cards because they do not carry revolving debt. 
In this case, the end-of-month credit card BP 
equals the sum of the payments made by credit 
card for consumption expenditures during the 
month. Therefore, counting the entire credit card 
BP as consumption, in addition to the individual 
credit card payments, would double count these 
consumption expenditures. 35 Furthermore, not 
all credit card payments are for consumption. 
Examples include taxes, cash advances (which 
also double count consumption expenditures), 
and balance transfers from one card to another. 
Therefore, careful measurement of each and 
every credit card payment is essential to proper 
measurement of consumer expenditures and their 
mapping to consumption. 
As evident from these examples, the 2012 
DCPC did not collect data on the components of 
loan repayments or other financial bills. There-
fore, the individual expenditure components of 
these repayments and bills cannot be classified 
accurately in measures of consumption, taxes, 
or savings. To handle this incompatibility, all 
payments to financial institutions (merchant 
code M35)-both bills and nonbills-are 
included in the "noncomparable" category of 
consumer expenditures. However, the noncom-
parable expenditures are included in the DCPC </p>

<p>34. "In personal outlays, PCE is raised by the sum of the 
imputed service charges for depositor and investor services 
and for borrower services, and personal interest payments 
are reduced by the imputed service charges for borrower 
services, since a portion of the interest payment is assumed 
to represent a fee for unpriced borrower services" [emphasis 
added] (Bureau of Economic Analysis 2014, 139). 
35. The situation is even more complicated when con-
sumers revolve some of their prior months' credit card debt 
forward to future months, because the credit card bill (cur-
rent or future) includes consumption expenditures from prior 
months. It also includes interest payments and possibly fees, 
both of which are payment for financial services. </p>

<p>total estimate of consumption because some 
of these financial expenditures belong there. 
This inclusion may cause total DCPC consump-
tion estimates to be too high for the reasons 
explained above. </p>

<p>Measured Relationship between Income 
and Payments. Based on the preceding dis-
cussion, measurement of income and payments 
involves two issues: (1) whether the concepts are 
recorded in the DCPC or not; and (2) whether the 
concepts are documented by the government or 
not. Conceptually, actual total income includes 
all four components, </p>

<p>Y = 
( 
Y 
RD + Y </p>

<p>RU </p>

<p>) 
+ 
( 
Y 
ND + Y </p>

<p>NU </p>

<p>) </p>

<p>and likewise for actual total payments. How-
ever, by construction, the measured estimate 
of income excludes undocumented income and 
the measured estimate of payments excludes 
unrecorded payments. Therefore, the differ-
ence between measured income and measured 
payments is: </p>

<p>Y −X = </p>

<p>(Ŷ 
RD −X RD </p>

<p>) 
+ </p>

<p>(Ŷ 
ND −X RU </p>

<p>) 
. </p>

<p>The first term in parentheses represents 
the difference between measured income and 
measured payments that are recorded and 
documented, which should be close to zero if 
measurement is reasonably accurate. The second 
term is a difference with less-comparable terms 
and is unlikely to be zero. Measured income that 
is documented but not recorded in the DCPC is 
likely to be large despite the relatively high cov-
erage of the DCPC (about half of consumption, 
as explained in the next section). Measured pay-
ments that are recorded but not documented-the 
shadow economy described earlier-could be as 
high as 10% of income or close to zero, depend-
ing on DCPC respondents' propensity to record 
shadow economic activity, which is likely to be 
higher the more they use cash for payments. </p>

<p>C. Estimating Consumption from Consumer 
Payments </p>

<p>Originally, the DCPC was not designed to 
measure consumer expenditures, much less 
consumption. However, enough details were 
collected about payments in the 2012 DCPC 
to enable approximate estimation of consumer 
expenditures as defined in other surveys. Of 
course, consumer expenditure estimates from 
any source (CE, DCPC, or other) require further </p>



<p>ECONOMIC INQUIRY </p>

<p>development to construct proper consumption 
estimates that can be compared with the NIPA 
PCE. Moreover, PCE estimates are not exactly 
comparable to the economic concept of con-
sumption and the measurement of PCE may even 
have some shortcomings relative to the DCPC. 
This subsection describes how the PCE and 
DCPC concepts of consumption expenditures 
relate to each other. 36  To begin, note that PCE estimates of con-
sumption expenditures, denotedĈ, are an 
approximate measure of the economic concept 
of consumption,Ĉ </p>

<p>= C − μ </p>

<p>C </p>

<p>with the usual composite error, μ c , that may 
also include conceptual discrepancies, such as the 
treatment of durable goods. 37 Total PCE includes 
all documented consumption payments, recorded 
and not recorded:Ĉ =Ĉ RD +Ĉ ND . Likewise, 
measured DCPC consumption payments arê </p>

<p>X C = X 
C − η </p>

<p>C </p>

<p>which includes all recorded consumption expen-
ditures, documented and undocumented:X C = 
X C RD +X C RU . Therefore, the most appropriate 
comparison of PCE and DCPC consumption is 
the difference between spending that is both 
recorded and documented: </p>

<p>C RD −X C RD = 
( 
C 
RD − X </p>

<p>C RD </p>

<p>) 
+ 
( 
η 
C RD − μ </p>

<p>C RD </p>

<p>) 
. </p>

<p>Unless there are conceptual differences 
between recorded and documented PCE and 
DCPC consumption (first term in parentheses), 
only composite measurement errors should cause 
the measured estimates to differ. Analogous 
equations describe the relationships between 
DCPC consumer payments and consumer expen-
diture estimates from the CE and FCS. The key </p>

<p>36. The BLS also constructs a comparable estimate of 
PCE using the CE, as discussed in Section V, but that process 
is not explained here. For more information, see https://www 
.bls.gov/cex/pce_compare_0203.pdf 
37. For example, PCE includes purchases of new cars, 
whereas economic consumption includes the service flow 
from the stock of cars. More generally, expenditures and con-
sumption do not always align exactly in time. Consumption 
of some goods and services, such as canned foods eaten at 
home or a vacation, may occur after the expenditure. This is 
especially true of durable goods. Furthermore, in the case of 
canned foods, for example, a stock of inventory arises when 
expenditures and consumption are measured at high frequen-
cies, such as daily. </p>

<p>measurement challenge for a payment diary is to 
identify payments that are conceptually equiva-
lent and are measured comparably with estimates 
of consumer expenditures or consumption from 
other data sources. The next section provides 
quantitative estimates of these comparisons. </p>

<p>V. AGGREGATE PAYMENTS AND CONSUMPTION 
EXPENDITURES </p>

<p>Carroll, Crossley, and Sabelhaus (2015) argue 
that "assessing whether the CE [Consumer 
Expenditure Survey] is comprehensively captur-
ing household spending necessarily begins with 
comparing aggregates across spending categories 
and time." Passero, Garner, and McCully (2015)  compare aggregate values of the CE with PCE 
from the NIPA. This section extends that work 
by including the DCPC and FCS and conducting 
two comparisons: (1) DCPC estimates of con-
sumer expenditures compared with estimates 
from the CE (survey and diary separately) and 
the FCS, as collected originally from the respec-
tive surveys; and (2) PCE estimates compared 
with consumption estimates constructed from 
the DCPC and CE. 38  To properly compare aggregate expenditures 
and consumption estimates, it is necessary to 
compare the detailed coverage of each data 
source and to focus on expenditure categories 
that are comparable across sources. Figure 3 
diagrams expenditure coverage for the PCE, CE, 
and DCPC (FCS coverage is similar to that of 
the CE). The CE and DCPC cover slightly more 
than half (54%) of PCE. Of the non-PCE portion 
of expenditures, the DCPC covers essentially all 
expenditures in the CE plus some not in PCE 
or CE. </p>

<p>A. Estimates of Consumer Expenditures </p>

<p>Table 4 reports estimates of aggregate con-
sumer payments and expenditures from the 
DCPC, CE, and FCS for the nine relatively 
comparable categories in Table 3. The CE esti-
mates are reported in total and separately for 
the survey and diary (CE-S and CE-D) compo-
nents to illustrate their relative contributions. 
DCPC expenditure estimates include confidence 
interval estimates in brackets, and the CE and </p>

<p>38. I thank an anonymous referee for the suggestion 
to conduct these separate comparisons and to disaggregate 
the CE into survey and diary components, which greatly 
enhanced the insight of the exercise relative to the previous 
version of the paper. </p>

<p>SCHUH: PAYMENT DIARIES </p>



<p>FIGURE 3 
Coverage of Expenditure Categories by U.S. Surveys </p>

<p>FCS estimates include their ratios to the DCPC 
estimates in parentheses. 
In October 2012, consumer payments in the 
DCPC were $11.2 trillion (annual rate), as shown 
in the first row of Table 4. In contrast, con-
sumer expenditures in the CE were $6.4 tril-
lion (57% of DCPC) and in the FCS only $4.9 
trillion (43% of DCPC). The 95% confidence 
interval for the DCPC ($8.9 to $13.6 trillion) 
suggests that the DCPC estimate may be sta-
tistically significantly higher than the CE and 
FCS estimates, provided their confidence inter-
vals are not too large. The first notable result 
of this article is that DCPC consumer payments 
are 75% or more higher than consumer expen-
diture estimates from leading U.S. surveys dedi-
cated to the task of measuring these expenditures, 
even though the DCPC was not designed for 
this purpose. 
The magnitude of DCPC payments relative 
to the CE or FCS expenditures varies consider-
ably across expenditure categories. Nearly 90% 
of DCPC payments occurred in five categories 
(food, housing, transportation, financial services, 
and other) that essentially accounted for the entire 
difference between the DCPC and CE ($4.8 tril- lion). The largest absolute difference occurred 
in food ($1.8 trillion); the housing and other 
categories each accounted for $1 trillion; and </p>

<p>transportation plus financial services together 
accounted for $0.9 trillion. The DCPC and CE 
estimates are notably similar in the remaining cat-
egories, which are relatively small in value except 
for transportation (about $1.6 trillion). Most of 
the difference between the CE and FCS occurred 
in three categories where the CE estimates were 
$1.2 trillion higher (financial services, transporta-
tion, and food). 
Regarding CE components, the CE-S 
accounted for about three-quarters of total 
CE expenditures ($4.8 trillion) compared with 
about one-quarter for the CE-D ($1.6 trillion). 
Nearly two-thirds ($1.0 trillion) of the CE-D 
expenditures come from the food and related 
category, whereas the DCPC estimate is three 
times higher than the CE-D estimate ($3.0 
trillion vs. $1.0 trillion). This result suggests 
that the survey mode (diary) is not the primary 
explanation for the DCPC's success. Rather, 
payment diaries like the DCPC are more adept 
at collecting expenditures comprehensively than 
product diaries like the CE-D. </p>

<p>theory. 39 Although PCE may have flaws, it is a 
reasonable benchmark for comparison to alterna-
tive consumption estimates. Neither the CE nor 
the DCPC has sufficient data, staff resources, or 
mandate to replicate the PCE entirely, much less 
improve on it. Both surveys would require exten-
sive expansion to replicate the entire range of 
PCE, and the CE would need to close the gap 
between its expenditure estimates and the DCPC 
payments as well. 
However, for the selected expenditures cate-
gories with mostly comparable definitions it is 
reasonable to compare consumption estimates 
from the DCPC and the CE with the PCE, as 
shown in Table 5. 40 This comparison uses CE 
estimates that the BLS has adjusted to be com-
parable with PCE as much as possible. 41 The 
DCPC estimates have been constructed merely </p>

Analysis (BEA) methodology, see https://www.bls.gov/opub/

comparison because they were considerably lower than the 
CE estimates.

<p>by using the expenditure categories most com-
parable to those in the PCE but have not been 
adjusted further to match PCE. (Recall that the 
DCPC was not designed to be a survey of con-
sumer expenditures, much less one to produce 
consumption estimates.) Furthermore, the DCPC 
and CE expenditure categories that were used to 
construct the respective estimates of consumption 
are not exactly comparable to each other. 
Table 5 begins by reporting in the first column 
total consumption expenditures and an adjusted 
total that removes some important but unique 
categories that are so different that they are not 
strictly comparable. The remaining rows contain 
categories with varying degrees of comparability. 
"Mostly comparable" DCPC categories have rea-
sonably close definitions to PCE and similar mea-
surement, even for seven detailed subcategories. 
"Mostly noncomparable" DCPC categories may 
have some rough similarities but also important 
discrepancies in definitions and measurability. 
PCE estimates appear in the middle columns to 
facilitate comparison with each unique CE or 
DCPC category. As in Table 4, the DCPC column 
includes the 95% confidence interval in brack-
ets, and the CE and DCPC columns include their 
ratios to PCE in parentheses. </p>

<p>a A detailed account of the comparison between CE and PCE, as well as the raw numbers, can be found here: https://www 
.bls.gov/cex/cecomparison.htm </p>

<p>In October, 2012, total PCE was $11.1 tril-
lion (annual rate), as shown in the first line 
of Table 5. Although not strictly comparable to 
PCE, consumer payments were $11.2 trillion for 
the DCPC (102% of PCE), and consumer expen-
ditures were $6.3 trillion for CE (57% of PCE). 
The largest strictly noncomparable item pertains 
to PCE imputed rent ($1.3 trillion), which the 
CE estimates closely ($1.4 trillion or 110% of 
PCE). The DCPC does not attempt to measure or 
construct imputed rent, but conceptually related 
payments (mortgages and dwelling expenses) are 
similar in magnitude to the imputed rent esti-
mates. PCE alone includes goods and services 
provided by nonprofits, and the DCPC alone 
includes miscellaneous non-PCE payments. 
Adjusted total PCE expenditures were $9.5 
trillion, as shown in the middle of Table 5. 
Adjusted total consumption payments and 
expenditures for the DCPC and CE were $8.7 
and $4.9 trillion, respectively (92% and 52% of 
PCE). The 95% confidence interval for DCPC </p>

<p>consumption payments ($7.9 to $9.6 trillion) 
would be statistically significantly different from 
PCE only if the PCE confidence interval of PCE 
were extraordinarily small. Although the DCPC 
and PCE estimates are roughly the same, recall 
that adjusted consumption expenditures cover 
only slightly more than half of PCE and include 
a nontrivial share of categories that are mostly 
noncomparable to PCE. The best comparison is 
DCPC and PCE estimates for the mostly com-
parable categories, where the DCPC estimate is 
$6 trillion (117% of PCE). The second notable 
result of this article is that DCPC consumption 
payments are very roughly similar to (about 
15% higher than) PCE estimates in comparable 
expenditure categories, even though the DCPC 
was not designed to measure consumption. 
The rough similarity between DCPC adjusted 
consumption payments and PCE may be coinci-
dental and not robust. Note that DCPC payments 
estimates in mostly noncomparable cate-
gories are much lower than the PCE estimates </p>



<p>ECONOMIC INQUIRY </p>

<p>($2.7 versus $4.4 trillion, or 62% of PCE), 
whereas DCPC payments in mostly comparable 
categories are considerably higher ($6 vs. $5.1 
trillion, or 117% of PCE). Moreover, the PCE 
point estimate is outside the 95% confidence 
interval for the DCPC. A similar result occurs 
in three comparable categories (food, general 
merchandise, and housing), which are signif-
icantly larger than in the PCE. These results 
suggest that apparent equality between DCPC 
and PCE may be a statistical artifact, not a robust 
finding about the ability of the DCPC to reliably 
estimate PCE. 42 Thus, the 2012 DCPC requires 
considerable further development and refinement 
to estimate PCE well. </p>

<p>C. Comparison with the SCF </p>

<p>The SCF provides another data source that 
supports a methodology for indirectly estimat-
ing consumption expenditures, which can be 
compared with the PCE and DCPC. As noted 
earlier, the triennial SCF obtains data on U.S. 
households' balance sheet items (assets and lia-
bilities) and income statement items (primarily 
the income portion, with limited expense data). 
Using SCF data on household income and esti-
mating saving as the SCF-measured change in 
wealth (ΔW) adjusted for unrealized capital gains 
(CG) over the 3-year period, one can derive the 
level of consumption as described in Sabelhaus  and Pence (1999) using the following identity 43 : </p>

<p>C 
SCF = Y 
SCF − T </p>

<p>SCF </p>

<p>− (1∕3) Δ </p>

<p>3 </p>

<p>( 
W 
SCF − CG </p>

<p>SCF </p>

<p>) 
. </p>

<p>Figure 4 plots the ratio of this derived SCF 
consumption estimate to PCE consumption 
( 
C SCF ∕Ĉ </p>

<p>) 
. On average over time, the derived 
SCF consumption estimate equals about 70% of 
total PCE, which is slightly higher than the CE 
estimate in Table 5 but still notably less than the 
DCPC estimate. </p>

<p>income. 44 As discussed in Section IV, a simple 
direct comparison of NIPA income and DCPC 
payments would be inappropriate due to numer-
ous conceptual and measurement differences 
between the estimates. However, it is feasible 
to make adjustments to income and payments 
that makes them approximately equal for com-
parison. The first adjustment is to remove taxes 
because they are a large part of third-party 
payments that are not recorded in the DCPC 
and it is not possible to identify the sales tax 
component of payments. Let Y d = Y − T denote 
disposable income, and X d = X − X T denote 
nontax payments. Then, estimated disposable 
income approximately equals estimated nontax 
payments after a few adjustments shown in the 
following expression: </p>

<p>Y d +T C − </p>

<p>(X 
C ND +X S ND </p>

<p>) </p>

<p>≈X d − </p>

<p>(X 
C RU +X S RU </p>

<p>) 
. </p>

<p>Sales tax payments are not identified sepa-
rately from other consumer payments, so they 
must be added back into disposable income. Non-
tax, third-party payments made by employers 
are not recorded in the DCPC, so they must 
be subtracted from disposable income. Finally, 
undocumented nontax payments are not included 
in disposable income, so they must be subtracted </p>

<p>44. The 2012 DCPC did not collect data directly on the 
dollar value of consumer income, although it did collect the 
dates of paydays (most recent and subsequent for any type 
of income). The 2012 SCPC contains an estimated range of 
annual income for the consumer's entire household and the 
ordinal rank of the consumer's income within that household. </p>

Disposition) </p>

<p>from nontax payments. Table 6 reports estimates 
for these adjusted concepts of aggregate dispos-
able income and payments. 
In the fourth quarter of 2012, NIPA dispos-
able personal income was $12.4 trillion (annual 
rate). After subtracting estimates of employer 
third-party consumer payments (supplements to 
wages and salaries plus Medicare and Medicaid 
expenses) and of sales taxes, adjusted dispos-
able personal income (ADPI) was $10.2 trillion. 
In October 2012, DCPC payments were $11.2 
trillion (annual rate). After subtracting recorded 
tax payments made directly by consumers and 
an estimate of undocumented payments (P2P 
payments), adjusted payments were $10.7 tril-
lion. The third notable result of this article is 
that DCPC payments accounted for 105% of 
income, without actually collecting data on per-
sonal income directly. 
Approximate equality between roughly com-
parable estimates of disposable income and pay-
ments is surprising and encouraging given the 
simplicity and imperfections of the estimation 
and adjustments, but much more work is required 
to obtain a satisfactory correspondence between 
the DCPC payments and NIPA income. To pro-
vide some perspective, note that the actual NIPA 
personal saving rate was 7.8% in October 2012, 
whereas the difference between adjusted dis-
posable income and adjusted nontax payments 
shown in Table 6 was −4%. Given the complex-
ity and imperfections of the measurement in the 
two data sources, it is not possible to identify the </p>

<p>components of the 12 percentage point difference 
or even to establish conclusively whether that dif-
ference is accurate. </p>

<p>VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS </p>

<p>A close examination of consumer payment 
diaries has revealed their potential to obtain 
relatively accurate estimates of consumer expen-
ditures and income. In particular, the Boston 
Fed's 2012 DCPC estimate of consumer pay-
ments is 75% higher than CE estimates of 
consumer expenditures, and in the ballpark of 
NIPA estimates of PCE and disposable income 
(after appropriate adjustments). This notable 
result has occurred without an explicit, inten-
tional effort to design and implement the DCPC 
with the goal of matching the NIPA data on con-
sumption and income. Originally, the DCPC was 
intended to provide estimates of the number and 
value of consumer payments, not consumption 
and income. 
Several features of the DCPC appear to have 
contributed to its surprisingly good performance 
in this (in no particular order of importance): </p>

<p>• Measuring expenditures at the level of an 
individual payment seems to be more effective 
in covering expenditures than measuring them at 
the level of individual products (too fine) or at 
the level of broad categories (too coarse/too 
aggregated). 
• Measuring payments each day seems to be 
more effective than measuring expenditures at 
lower frequencies (too much time aggregation). 
• Reducing respondent burden (roughly two 
payments per day for 3 days) and relying on ran-
dom sampling with rotating waves seems to be 
more effective than asking all individual con-
sumers in a sample to report everything they buy 
in detail over longer periods of time. 
• Using representative samples drawn from 
Internet-access panels seems to produce better 
rates of participation and response, and more 
careful data reporting, than using random sam-
ples from the broader population that is less 
inclined to participate and report well; the ben-
efits seem to offset potential sample selection 
issues. </p>

<p>Except for measurement of expenditures by 
payment, these features are not unique, nei-
ther is any one of them-even the focus on 
payments-solely responsible for the DCPC's 
positive result. Rather, it is the combination of 
all these features together in one data collection </p>



<p>ECONOMIC INQUIRY </p>

<p>effort that yields success. Therefore, the results 
presented in this article suggest that embark-
ing on further refinement and development 
of consumer payment diaries, done with the 
intent of contributing to the accurate measure-
ment of consumption, may yield additional 
notable contributions. 
Of course, the DCPC payment estimates are 
not without flaws and limitations, as might be 
expected from a methodology used for a purpose 
other than that for which it was designed. Some 
of the features of the DCPC that warrant further 
development and improvement include (in no 
particular order of importance): </p>

<p>• Sampling and measuring total household 
expenditures by more consumer members rather 
than individual consumers randomly drawn from 
(some) households. 
• Identifying consumption (PCE) versus non-
consumption expenditures that match NIPA def-
initions and methodology, including separating 
bills from other payments. 
• Separately identifying the payee from the 
types of goods and services purchased rather than 
combining these into one "merchant category" 
that tries to identify them jointly. 
• Collecting more-detailed information about 
loan repayments and other bills with components </p>

<p>that represent economically different types of 
consumer allocations of income. 
• Directly collecting information on receipt 
of personal income in dollar values rather than 
indirectly measuring income from payments 
data. </p>

<p>Improvements in many of these and other fea-
tures were implemented in the Boston Fed's 2015 
DCPC (conducted from October 16 to December 
15), which will be reported in future research. 
The revisions were designed to follow the 
methodology of Samphantharak and Townsend  (2010), which proposes a complete integration 
of survey methodology with corporate finan-
cial statements as applied to households. More 
generally, the 2015 DCPC highlights the fact 
that payment diaries link individual expenditure 
entries of the income statement with their asso-
ciated assets and liabilities in the balance sheet 
through detailed individual cash flow statements. 
Samphantharak, Schuh, and Townsend (2017)  explain how this methodology applies to the 2012 
DCPC and provide guidelines for the 2015 DCPC 
revisions. More research and data collection are 
needed to realize the full potential of payment 
diaries for measuring consumer expenditures 
and for fully integrating the survey methodology 
with household financial statements. </p>

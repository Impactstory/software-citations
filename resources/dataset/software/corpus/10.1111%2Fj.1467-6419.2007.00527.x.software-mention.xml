<p>Abstract. Propensity score matching (PSM) has become a popular approach to 
estimate causal treatment effects. It is widely applied when evaluating labour 
market policies, but empirical examples can be found in very diverse fields of 
study. Once the researcher has decided to use PSM, he is confronted with a lot of 
questions regarding its implementation. To begin with, a first decision has to be 
made concerning the estimation of the propensity score. Following that one has to 
decide which matching algorithm to choose and determine the region of common 
support. Subsequently, the matching quality has to be assessed and treatment 
effects and their standard errors have to be estimated. Furthermore, questions like 
'what to do if there is choice-based sampling?' or 'when to measure effects?' 
can be important in empirical studies. Finally, one might also want to test the 
sensitivity of estimated treatment effects with respect to unobserved heterogeneity 
or failure of the common support condition. Each implementation step involves a 
lot of decisions and different approaches can be thought of. The aim of this paper 
is to discuss these implementation issues and give some guidance to researchers 
who want to use PSM for evaluation purposes. </p>

<p>Matching has become a popular approach to estimate causal treatment effects. It is 
widely applied when evaluating labour market policies (see e.g., Heckman et al.,  1997a; Dehejia and Wahba, 1999), but empirical examples can be found in very 
diverse fields of study. It applies for all situations where one has a treatment, a 
group of treated individuals and a group of untreated individuals. The nature of 
treatment may be very diverse. For example, Perkins et al. (2000) discuss the usage of 
matching in pharmacoepidemiologic research. Hitt and Frei (2002) analyse the effect 
of online banking on the profitability of customers. Davies and Kim (2003) compare </p>

<p>the effect on the percentage bid-ask spread of Canadian firms being interlisted on a 
US Exchange, whereas Brand and Halaby (2006) analyse the effect of elite college 
attendance on career outcomes. Ham et al. (2004) study the effect of a migration 
decision on the wage growth of young men and Bryson (2002) analyses the effect 
of union membership on wages of employees. Every microeconometric evaluation 
study has to overcome the fundamental evaluation problem and address the possible 
occurrence of selection bias. The first problem arises because we would like to know 
the difference between the participants' outcome with and without treatment. Clearly, 
we cannot observe both outcomes for the same individual at the same time. Taking 
the mean outcome of nonparticipants as an approximation is not advisable, since 
participants and nonparticipants usually differ even in the absence of treatment. 
This problem is known as selection bias and a good example is the case where 
high-skilled individuals have a higher probability of entering a training programme 
and also have a higher probability of finding a job. The matching approach is one 
possible solution to the selection problem. It originated from the statistical literature 
and shows a close link to the experimental context. 
1 Its basic idea is to find in a 
large group of nonparticipants those individuals who are similar to the participants in 
all relevant pretreatment characteristics X. That being done, differences in outcomes 
of this well selected and thus adequate control group and of participants can be 
attributed to the programme. The underlying identifying assumption is known as 
unconfoundedness, selection on observables or conditional independence. It should 
be clear that matching is no 'magic bullet' that will solve the evaluation problem 
in any case. It should only be applied if the underlying identifying assumption can 
be credibly invoked based on the informational richness of the data and a detailed 
understanding of the institutional set-up by which selection into treatment takes 
place (see for example the discussion in Blundell et al., 2005). For the rest of the 
paper we will assume that this assumption holds. 
Since conditioning on all relevant covariates is limited in the case of a high 
dimensional vector X ('curse of dimensionality'), Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983b)  suggest the use of so-called balancing scores b(X), i.e. functions of the relevant 
observed covariates X such that the conditional distribution of X given b(X) is 
independent of assignment into treatment. One possible balancing score is the 
propensity score, i.e. the probability of participating in a programme given observed 
characteristics X. Matching procedures based on this balancing score are known 
as propensity score matching (PSM) and will be the focus of this paper. Once the 
researcher has decided to use PSM, he is confronted with a lot of questions regarding 
its implementation. Figure 1 summarizes the necessary steps when implementing 
PSM. </p>

<p>2   The aim of this paper is to discuss these issues and give some practical guidance 
to researchers who want to use PSM for evaluation purposes. The paper is organized 
as follows. In Section 2, we will describe the basic evaluation framework and 
possible treatment effects of interest. Furthermore we show how PSM solves the 
evaluation problem and highlight the implicit identifying assumptions. In Section 
3, we will focus on implementation steps of PSM estimators. To begin with, a 
first decision has to be made concerning the estimation of the propensity score </p>

<p>(see Section 3.1). One has not only to decide about the probability model to 
be used for estimation, but also about variables which should be included in 
this model. In Section 3.2, we briefly evaluate the (dis-)advantages of different 
matching algorithms. Following that we discuss how to check the overlap between 
treatment and comparison group and how to implement the common support 
requirement in Section 3.3. In Section 3.4 we will show how to assess the matching 
quality. Subsequently we present the problem of choice-based sampling and discuss 
the question 'when to measure programme effects?' in Sections 3.5 and 3.6. 
Estimating standard errors for treatment effects will be discussed in Section 3.7 
before we show in 3.8 how PSM can be combined with other evaluation methods. The 
following Section 3.9 is concerned with sensitivity issues, where we first describe 
approaches that allow researchers to determine the sensitivity of estimated effects 
with respect to a failure of the underlying unconfoundedness assumption. After 
that we introduce an approach that incorporates information from those individuals 
who failed the common support restriction, to calculate bounds of the parameter 
of interest, if all individuals from the sample at hand would have been included. 
Section 3.10 will briefly discuss the issues of programme heterogeneity, dynamic 
selection problems, and the choice of an appropriate control group and includes also 
a brief review of the available software to implement matching. Finally, Section 4 
reviews all steps and concludes. </p>

<p>2. Evaluation Framework and Matching Basics </p>

<p>Roy-Rubin Model </p>

<p>Inference about the impact of a treatment on the outcome of an individual involves 
speculation about how this individual would have performed had (s)he not received 
the treatment. The standard framework in evaluation analysis to formalize this 
problem is the potential outcome approach or Roy-Rubin model (Roy, 1951; Rubin,  1974). The main pillars of this model are individuals, treatment and potential 
outcomes. In the case of a binary treatment the treatment indicator D i equals one if 
individual i receives treatment and zero otherwise. The potential outcomes are then 
defined as Y i (D i ) for each individual i, where i = 1, . . . , N and N denotes the total 
population. The treatment effect for an individual i can be written as </p>

<p>τ i = Y i (1) − Y i (0) 
(1) </p>

<p>Journal of Economic Surveys (2008) Vol. 22, No. 1, pp. 31-72 
C 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation C 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd </p>



<p>CALIENDO AND KOPEINIG </p>

<p>The fundamental evaluation problem arises because only one of the potential 
outcomes is observed for each individual i. The unobserved outcome is called the 
counterfactual outcome. Hence, estimating the individual treatment effect τ i is not 
possible and one has to concentrate on (population) average treatment effects. </p>

<p>3   Parameter of Interest and Selection Bias </p>

<p>Two parameters are most frequently estimated in the literature. The first one is the 
population average treatment effect (ATE), which is simply the difference of the 
expected outcomes after participation and nonparticipation: </p>

<p>τ ATE = E(τ ) = E[Y (1) − Y (0)] 
(2) </p>

<p>This parameter answers the question: 'What is the expected effect on the outcome if 
individuals in the population were randomly assigned to treatment?' Heckman (1997)  notes that this estimate might not be of relevance to policy makers because it includes 
the effect on persons for whom the programme was never intended. For example, 
if a programme is specifically targeted at individuals with low family income, there 
is little interest in the effect of such a programme for a millionaire. Therefore, the 
most prominent evaluation parameter is the so-called average treatment effect on 
the treated (ATT), which focuses explicitly on the effects on those for whom the 
programme is actually intended. It is given by </p>

<p>τ ATT = E(τ |D = 1) = E[Y (1)|D = 1] − E[Y (0)|D = 1] 
(3) </p>

<p>The expected value of ATT is defined as the difference between expected outcome 
values with and without treatment for those who actually participated in treatment. 
In the sense that this parameter focuses directly on actual treatment participants, it 
determines the realized gross gain from the programme and can be compared with its 
costs, helping to decide whether the programme is successful or not (Heckman et al.,  1999). The most interesting parameter to estimate depends on the specific evaluation 
context and the specific question asked. Heckman et al. (1999) discuss further 
parameters, like the proportion of participants who benefit from the programme 
or the distribution of gains at selected base state values. For most evaluation studies, 
however, the focus lies on ATT and therefore we will focus on this parameter, 
too. 
4 As the counterfactual mean for those being treated -E[Y (0)|D = 1] -is not 
observed, one has to choose a proper substitute for it in order to estimate ATT. Using 
the mean outcome of untreated individuals E[Y (0)|D = 0] is in nonexperimental 
studies usually not a good idea, because it is most likely that components which 
determine the treatment decision also determine the outcome variable of interest. 
Thus, the outcomes of individuals from the treatment and comparison groups would 
differ even in the absence of treatment leading to a 'selection bias'. For ATT it can 
be noted as </p>

<p>E[Y (1)|D = 1] − E[Y (0)|D = 0] = τ AT T + E[Y (0)|D = 1] − E[Y (0)|D = 0] (4) </p>

C 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation C 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd </p>

<p>IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING </p>



<p>The difference between the left-hand side of equation (4) and τ ATT is the so-called 
'selection bias'. The true parameter τ ATT is only identified if </p>

<p>E[Y (0)|D = 1] − E[Y (0)|D = 0] = 0 
( 5 ) </p>

<p>In social experiments where assignment to treatment is random this is ensured and 
the treatment effect is identified. 
5 In nonexperimental studies one has to invoke some 
identifying assumptions to solve the selection problem stated in equation (4). </p>

<p>Unconfoundedness and Common Support </p>

<p>One major strand of evaluation literature focuses on the estimation of treatment 
effects under the assumption that the treatment satisfies some form of exogene-
ity. Different versions of this assumption are referred to as unconfoundedness 
(Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983b), selection on observables (Heckman and Robb,  1985) or conditional independence assumption (CIA) (Lechner, 1999). We will 
use these terms throughout the paper interchangeably. This assumption implies that 
systematic differences in outcomes between treated and comparison individuals with 
the same values for covariates are attributable to treatment. Imbens (2004) gives an 
extensive overview of estimating ATEs under unconfoundedness. The identifying 
assumption can be written as </p>

<p>Assumption 1. Unconfoundedness: Y (0), Y (1) D | X </p>

<p>where 
denotes independence, i.e. given a set of observable covariates X which 
are not affected by treatment, potential outcomes are independent of treatment 
assignment. This implies that all variables that influence treatment assignment and 
potential outcomes simultaneously have to be observed by the researcher. Clearly, 
this is a strong assumption and has to be justified by the data quality at hand. For 
the rest of the paper we will assume that this condition holds. If the researcher 
believes that the available data are not rich enough to justify this assumption, he 
has to rely on different identification strategies which explicitly allow selection 
on unobservables, too. Prominent examples are difference-in-differences (DID) and 
instrumental variables estimators. 
6 We will show in Section 3.8 how propensity score 
matching can be combined with some of these methods. 
A further requirement besides independence is the common support or overlap 
condition. It rules out the phenomenon of perfect predictability of D given X. </p>

<p>Assumption 2. Overlap: 0 &lt; P(D = 1|X ) &lt; 1. </p>

<p>It ensures that persons with the same X values have a positive probability of being 
both participants and nonparticipants (Heckman et al., 1999). Rosenbaum and Rubin  (1983b) call Assumptions 1 and 2 together 'strong ignorability'. Under 'strong 
ignorability' ATE in (2) and ATT in (3) can be defined for all values of X. Heckman  et al. (1998b) demonstrate that the ignorability or unconfoundedness conditions are 
overly strong. All that is needed for estimation of (2) and (3) is mean independence. 
However, Lechner (2002) argues that Assumption 1 has the virtue of identifying </p>

C 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation C 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd </p>



<p>CALIENDO AND KOPEINIG </p>

<p>mean effects for all transformations of the outcome variables. The reason is that 
the weaker assumption of mean independence is intrinsically tied to functional form 
assumptions, making an identification of average effects on transformations of the 
original outcome impossible (Imbens, 2004). Furthermore, it will be difficult to argue 
why conditional mean independence should hold and Assumption 1 might still be 
violated in empirical studies. 
If we are interested in estimating the ATT only, we can weaken the unconfound-
edness assumption in a different direction. In that case one needs only to assume </p>

<p>Assumption 3. Unconfoundedness for controls: Y (0) D | X </p>

<p>and the weaker overlap assumption </p>

<p>Assumption 4. Weak overlap: P(D = 1 | X ) &lt; 1. </p>

<p>These assumptions are sufficient for identification of (3), because the moments of 
the distribution of Y (1) for the treated are directly estimable. </p>

<p>Unconfoundedness given the Propensity Score </p>

<p>It should also be clear that conditioning on all relevant covariates is limited in 
the case of a high dimensional vector X. For instance if X contains s covariates 
which are all dichotomous, the number of possible matches will be 2 
s . To deal 
with this dimensionality problem, Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983b) suggest using 
so-called balancing scores. They show that if potential outcomes are independent 
of treatment conditional on covariates X, they are also independent of treatment 
conditional on a balancing score b(X). The propensity score P(D = 1 | X ) = 
P(X ), i.e. the probability for an individual to participate in a treatment given his 
observed covariates X, is one possible balancing score. Hence, if Assumption 1 
holds, all biases due to observable components can be removed by conditioning on 
the propensity score (Imbens, 2004). </p>

<p>Corollary 1. Unconfoundedness given the propensity score: Y (0), Y (1) D | P(X ). </p>

<p>7   Estimation Strategy </p>

<p>Given that CIA holds and assuming additionally that there is overlap between both 
groups, the PSM estimator for ATT can be written in general as </p>

<p>τ </p>

<p>P SM </p>

<p>AT T = E P(X )|D=1 {E[Y (1)|D = 1, P(X )] − E[Y (0)|D = 0, P(X )]} 
(6) </p>

<p>To put it in words, the PSM estimator is simply the mean difference in 
outcomes over the common support, appropriately weighted by the propensity score 
distribution of participants. Based on this brief outline of the matching estimator in 
the general evaluation framework, we are now going to discuss the implementation 
of PSM in detail. </p>

<p>IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING </p>



<p>3. Implementation of Propensity Score Matching </p>

<p>3.1 Estimating the Propensity Score </p>

<p>When estimating the propensity score, two choices have to be made. The first one 
concerns the model to be used for the estimation, and the second one the variables 
to be included in this model. We will start with the model choice before we discuss 
which variables to include in the model. </p>

<p>Model Choice -Binary Treatment </p>

<p>Little advice is available regarding which functional form to use (see for example 
the discussion in Smith, 1997). In principle any discrete choice model can be used. 
Preference for logit or probit models (compared to linear probability models) derives 
from the well-known shortcomings of the linear probability model, especially the 
unlikeliness of the functional form when the response variable is highly skewed and 
predictions that are outside the [0, 1] bounds of probabilities. However, when the 
purpose of a model is classification rather than estimation of structural coefficients, 
it is less clear that these criticisms apply (Smith, 1997). For the binary treatment 
case, where we estimate the probability of participation versus nonparticipation, logit 
and probit models usually yield similar results. Hence, the choice is not too critical, 
even though the logit distribution has more density mass in the bounds. </p>

<p>Model Choice -Multiple Treatments </p>

<p>However, when leaving the binary treatment case, the choice of the model becomes 
more important. The multiple treatment case (as discussed in Imbens (2000) and 
Lechner (2001a)) consists of more than two alternatives, for example when an 
individual is faced with the choice to participate in job-creation schemes, vocational 
training or wage subsidy programmes or to not participate at all (we will describe 
this approach in more detail in Section 3.10). For that case it is well known that 
the multinomial logit is based on stronger assumptions than the multinomial probit 
model, making the latter the preferable option. 
8 However, since the multinomial 
probit is computationally more burdensome, a practical alternative is to estimate a 
series of binomial models as suggested by Lechner (2001a). Bryson et al. (2002)  note that there are two shortcomings regarding this approach. First, as the number of 
options increases, the number of models to be estimated increases disproportionately 
(for L options we need 0.5(L(L − 1)) models). Second, in each model only two 
options at a time are considered and consequently the choice is conditional on being 
in one of the two selected groups. On the other hand, Lechner (2001a) compares the 
performance of the multinomial probit approach and series estimation and finds little 
difference in their relative performance. He suggests that the latter approach may be 
more robust since a mis-specification in one of the series will not compromise all 
others as would be the case in the multinomial probit model. </p>

<p>CALIENDO AND KOPEINIG </p>

<p>Variable Choice: </p>

<p>More advice is available regarding the inclusion (or exclusion) of covariates in 
the propensity score model. The matching strategy builds on the CIA, requiring 
that the outcome variable(s) must be independent of treatment conditional on the 
propensity score. Hence, implementing matching requires choosing a set of variables 
X that credibly satisfy this condition. Heckman et al. (1997a) and Dehejia and Wahba  (1999) show that omitting important variables can seriously increase bias in resulting 
estimates. Only variables that influence simultaneously the participation decision 
and the outcome variable should be included. Hence, economic theory, a sound 
knowledge of previous research and also information about the institutional settings 
should guide the researcher in building up the model (see e.g., Sianesi, 2004; Smith  and Todd, 2005). It should also be clear that only variables that are unaffected by 
participation (or the anticipation of it) should be included in the model. To ensure 
this, variables should either be fixed over time or measured before participation. In 
the latter case, it must be guaranteed that the variable has not been influenced by 
the anticipation of participation. Heckman et al. (1999) also point out that the data 
for participants and nonparticipants should stem from the same sources (e.g. the 
same questionnaire). The better and more informative the data are, the easier it is 
to credibly justify the CIA and the matching procedure. However, it should also be 
clear that 'too good' data is not helpful either. If P(X ) = 0 or P(X ) = 1 for some 
values of X, then we cannot use matching conditional on those X values to estimate 
a treatment effect, because persons with such characteristics either always or never 
receive treatment. Hence, the common support condition as stated in Assumption 2 
fails and matches cannot be performed. Some randomness is needed that guarantees 
that persons with identical characteristics can be observed in both states (Heckman  et al., 1998b). 
In cases of uncertainty of the proper specification, sometimes the question may 
arise whether it is better to include too many rather than too few variables. Bryson  et al. (2002) note that there are two reasons why over-parameterized models should 
be avoided. First, it may be the case that including extraneous variables in the 
participation model exacerbates the support problem. Second, although the inclusion 
of nonsignificant variables in the propensity score specification will not bias the 
propensity score estimates or make them inconsistent, it can increase their variance. 
The results from Augurzky and Schmidt (2001) point in the same direction. 
They run a simulation study to investigate PSM when selection into treatment is 
remarkably strong, and treated and untreated individuals differ considerably in their 
observable characteristics. In their set-up, explanatory variables in the selection 
equation are partitioned into three sets. The first set (set 1) includes covariates 
which strongly influence the treatment decision but weakly influence the outcome 
variable. Furthermore, they include covariates which are relevant to the outcome 
but irrelevant to the treatment decision (set 2) and covariates which influence both 
(set 3). Including the full set of covariates in the propensity score specification (full 
model including all three sets of covariates) might cause problems in small samples 
in terms of higher variance, since either some treated have to be discarded from the </p>

C 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation C 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd </p>

<p>IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING </p>



<p>analysis or control units have to be used more than once. They show that matching 
on an inconsistent estimate of the propensity score (i.e. partial model including only 
set 3 or both sets 1 and 3) produces better estimation results of the ATE. 
On the other hand, Rubin and Thomas (1996) recommend against 'trimming' 
models in the name of parsimony. They argue that a variable should only be excluded 
from analysis if there is consensus that the variable is either unrelated to the outcome 
or not a proper covariate. If there are doubts about these two points, they explicitly 
advise to include the relevant variables in the propensity score estimation. 
By these criteria, there are both reasons for and against including all of the 
reasonable covariates available. Basically, the points made so far imply that the 
choice of variables should be based on economic theory and previous empirical 
findings. But clearly, there are also some formal (statistical) tests which can be 
used. Heckman et al. (1998a), Heckman and Smith (1999) and Black and Smith  (2004) discuss three strategies for the selection of variables to be used in estimating 
the propensity score. </p>

<p>Hit or Miss Method </p>

<p>The first one is the 'hit or miss' method or prediction rate metric, where variables 
are chosen to maximize the within-sample correct prediction rates. This method 
classifies an observation as '1' if the estimated propensity score is larger than 
the sample proportion of persons taking treatment, i.e.P(X ) &gt; P. IfP(X ) ≤ P 
observations are classified as '0'. This method maximizes the overall classification 
rate for the sample assuming that the costs for the misclassification are equal for 
the two groups (Heckman et al., 1997a). 
9 But clearly, it has to be kept in mind that 
the main purpose of the propensity score estimation is not to predict selection into 
treatment as well as possible but to balance all covariates (Augurzky and Schmidt,  2001). </p>

<p>Statistical Significance </p>

<p>The second approach relies on statistical significance and is very common in 
textbook econometrics. To do so, one starts with a parsimonious specification of 
the model, e.g. a constant, the age and some regional information, and then 'tests 
up' by iteratively adding variables to the specification. A new variable is kept if 
it is statistically significant at conventional levels. If combined with the 'hit or 
miss' method, variables are kept if they are statistically significant and increase the 
prediction rates by a substantial amount (Heckman et al., 1998a). </p>

<p>Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation </p>

<p>Leave-one-out cross-validation can also be used to choose the set of variables 
to be included in the propensity score. Black and Smith (2004) implement their 
model selection procedure by starting with a 'minimal' model containing only two 
variables. They subsequently add blocks of additional variables and compare the </p>

<p>CALIENDO AND KOPEINIG </p>

<p>resulting mean squared errors. As a note of caution, they stress that this amounts 
to choosing the propensity score model based on goodness-of-fit considerations, 
rather than based on theory and evidence about the set of variables related to the 
participation decision and the outcomes (Black and Smith, 2004). They also point 
out an interesting trade-off in finite samples between the plausibility of the CIA and 
the variance of the estimates. When using the full specification, bias arises from 
selecting a wide bandwidth in response to the weakness of the common support. 
In contrast to that, when matching on the minimal specification, common support 
is not a problem but the plausibility of the CIA is. This trade-off also affects the 
estimated standard errors, which are smaller for the minimal specification where the 
common support condition poses no problem. 
Finally, checking the matching quality can also help to determine the propensity 
score specification and we will discuss this point later in Section 3.4. </p>

<p>Overweighting some Variables </p>

<p>Let us assume for the moment that we have found a satisfactory specification 
of the model. It may sometimes be felt that some variables play a specifically 
important role in determining participation and outcome (Bryson et al., 2002). As 
an example, one can think of the influence of gender and region in determining 
the wage of individuals. Let us take as given for the moment that men earn more 
than women and the wage level is higher in region A compared to region B. If we 
add dummy variables for gender and region in the propensity score estimation, it is 
still possible that women in region B are matched with men in region A, since the 
gender and region dummies are only a subset of all available variables. There are 
basically two ways to put greater emphasis on specific variables. One can either find 
variables in the comparison group who are identical with respect to these variables, 
or carry out matching on subpopulations. The study from Lechner (2002) is a good 
example for the first approach. He evaluates the effects of active labour market 
policies in Switzerland and uses the propensity score as a 'partial' balancing score 
which is complemented by an exact matching on sex, duration of unemployment 
and native language. Heckman et al. (1997a, 1998a) use the second strategy and 
implement matching separately for four demographic groups. That implies that the 
complete matching procedure (estimating the propensity score, checking the common 
support, etc.) has to be implemented separately for each group. This is analogous to 
insisting on a perfect match, e.g. in terms of gender and region, and then carrying 
out propensity score matching. This procedure is especially recommendable if one 
expects the effects to be heterogeneous between certain groups. </p>

<p>Alternatives to the Propensity Score </p>

<p>Finally, it should also be noted that it is possible to match on a measure other 
than the propensity score, namely the underlying index of the score estimation. 
The advantage of this is that the index differentiates more between observations 
in the extremes of the distribution of the propensity score (Lechner, 2000). This is </p>

<p>useful if there is some concentration of observations in the tails of the distribution. 
Additionally, in some recent papers the propensity score is estimated by duration 
models. This is of particular interest if the 'timing of events' plays a crucial role 
(see e.g. Brodaty et al., 2001; Sianesi, 2004). </p>

<p>3.2 Choosing a Matching Algorithm </p>

<p>The PSM estimator in its general form was stated in equation (6). All matching 
estimators contrast the outcome of a treated individual with outcomes of comparison 
group members. PSM estimators differ not only in the way the neighbourhood for 
each treated individual is defined and the common support problem is handled, 
but also with respect to the weights assigned to these neighbours. Figure 2 depicts 
different PSM estimators and the inherent choices to be made when they are used. 
We will not discuss the technical details of each estimator here at depth but rather 
present the general ideas and the involved trade-offs with each algorithm. </p>

<p>10   Nearest Neighbour Matching </p>

<p>The most straightforward matching estimator is nearest neighbour (NN) matching. 
The individual from the comparison group is chosen as a matching partner for a 
treated individual that is closest in terms of the propensity score. Several variants 
of NN matching are proposed, e.g. NN matching 'with replacement' and 'without 
replacement'. In the former case, an untreated individual can be used more than 
once as a match, whereas in the latter case it is considered only once. Matching with 
replacement involves a trade-off between bias and variance. If we allow replacement, 
the average quality of matching will increase and the bias will decrease. This is of </p>

<p>CALIENDO AND KOPEINIG </p>

<p>particular interest with data where the propensity score distribution is very different 
in the treatment and the control group. For example, if we have a lot of treated 
individuals with high propensity scores but only few comparison individuals with 
high propensity scores, we get bad matches as some of the high-score participants 
will get matched to low-score nonparticipants. This can be overcome by allowing 
replacement, which in turn reduces the number of distinct nonparticipants used 
to construct the counterfactual outcome and thereby increases the variance of the 
estimator (Smith and Todd, 2005). A problem which is related to NN matching 
without replacement is that estimates depend on the order in which observations 
get matched. Hence, when using this approach it should be ensured that ordering is 
randomly done. </p>

<p>11 </p>

<p>It is also suggested to use more than one NN ('oversampling'). This form of 
matching involves a trade-off between variance and bias, too. It trades reduced 
variance, resulting from using more information to construct the counterfactual for 
each participant, with increased bias that results from on average poorer matches 
(see e.g. Smith, 1997). When using oversampling, one has to decide how many 
matching partners should be chosen for each treated individual and which weight 
(e.g. uniform or triangular weight) should be assigned to them. </p>

<p>Caliper and Radius Matching </p>

<p>NN matching faces the risk of bad matches if the closest neighbour is far away. This 
can be avoided by imposing a tolerance level on the maximum propensity score 
distance (caliper). Hence, caliper matching is one form of imposing a common 
support condition (we will come back to this point in Section 3.3). Bad matches are 
avoided and the matching quality rises. However, if fewer matches can be performed, 
the variance of the estimates increases. 
12 Applying caliper matching means that an 
individual from the comparison group is chosen as a matching partner for a treated 
individual that lies within the caliper ('propensity range') and is closest in terms of 
propensity score. As Smith and Todd (2005) note, a possible drawback of caliper 
matching is that it is difficult to know a priori what choice for the tolerance level 
is reasonable. 
Dehejia and Wahba (2002) suggest a variant of caliper matching which is called 
radius matching. The basic idea of this variant is to use not only the NN within 
each caliper but all of the comparison members within the caliper. A benefit of this 
approach is that it uses only as many comparison units as are available within the 
caliper and therefore allows for usage of extra (fewer) units when good matches are 
(not) available. Hence, it shares the attractive feature of oversampling mentioned 
above, but avoids the risk of bad matches. </p>

<p>Stratification and Interval Matching </p>

<p>The idea of stratification matching is to partition the common support of the 
propensity score into a set of intervals (strata) and to calculate the impact within 
each interval by taking the mean difference in outcomes between treated and </p>

<p>IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING </p>



<p>control observations. This method is also known as interval matching, blocking 
and subclassification (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1984). Clearly, one question to 
be answered is how many strata should be used in empirical analysis. Cochran  (1968) shows that five subclasses are often enough to remove 95% of the bias 
associated with one single covariate. Since, as Imbens (2004) notes, all bias under 
unconfoundedness is associated with the propensity score, this suggests that under 
normality the use of five strata removes most of the bias associated with all 
covariates. One way to justify the choice of the number of strata is to check the 
balance of the propensity score (or the covariates) within each stratum (see e.g. 
Aakvik, 2001). Most of the algorithms can be described in the following way. 
First, check if within a stratum the propensity score is balanced. If not, strata 
are too large and need to be split. If, conditional on the propensity score being 
balanced, the covariates are unbalanced, the specification of the propensity score 
is not adequate and has to be respecified, e.g. through the addition of higher-order 
terms or interactions (see Dehejia and Wahba, 1999; Dehejia, 2005). </p>

<p>Kernel and Local Linear Matching </p>

<p>The matching algorithms discussed so far have in common that only a few 
observations from the comparison group are used to construct the counterfactual 
outcome of a treated individual. Kernel matching (KM) and local linear matching 
(LLM) are nonparametric matching estimators that use weighted averages of (nearly) 
all -depending on the choice of the kernel function -individuals in the control 
group to construct the counterfactual outcome. Thus, one major advantage of these 
approaches is the lower variance which is achieved because more information is 
used. A drawback of these methods is that possibly observations are used that are 
bad matches. Hence, the proper imposition of the common support condition is of 
major importance for KM and LLM. Heckman et al. (1998b) derive the asymptotic 
distribution of these estimators and Heckman et al. (1997a) present an application. 
As Smith and Todd (2005) note, KM can be seen as a weighted regression of the 
counterfactual outcome on an intercept with weights given by the kernel weights. 
Weights depend on the distance between each individual from the control group 
and the participant observation for which the counterfactual is estimated. It is worth 
noting that if weights from a symmetric, nonnegative, unimodal kernel are used, then 
the average places higher weight on persons close in terms of the propensity score 
of a treated individual and lower weight on more distant observations. The estimated 
intercept provides an estimate of the counterfactual mean. The difference between 
KM and LLM is that the latter includes in addition to the intercept a linear term in the 
propensity score of a treated individual. This is an advantage whenever comparison 
group observations are distributed asymmetrically around the treated observation, 
e.g. at boundary points, or when there are gaps in the propensity score distribution. 
When applying KM one has to choose the kernel function and the bandwidth 
parameter. The first point appears to be relatively unimportant in practice (DiNardo  and Tobias, 2001). What is seen as more important (see e.g. Silverman, 1986;  Pagan and Ullah, 1999) is the choice of the bandwidth parameter with the following </p>

therefore leading to a better fit and a decreasing variance between the estimated and 
the true underlying density function. On the other hand, underlying features may be 
smoothed away by a large bandwidth leading to a biased estimate. The bandwidth 
choice is therefore a compromise between a small variance and an unbiased estimate 
of the true density function. It should be noted that LLM is a special case of local 
polynomial matching (LPM). LPM includes in addition to an intercept a term of 
polynomial order p in the propensity score, e.g. p = 1 for LLM, p = 2 for local 
quadratic matching or p = 3 for local cubic matching. Generally, the larger the 
polynomial order p is the smaller will be the asymptotic bias but the larger will be 
the asymptotic variance. To our knowledge Ham et al. (2004) is the only application 
of local cubic matching so far, and hence practical experiences with LPM estimators 
with p ≥ 2 are rather limited. </p>

<p>Trade-offs in Terms of Bias and Efficiency </p>

<p>Having presented the different possibilities, the question remains of how one should 
select a specific matching algorithm. Clearly, asymptotically all PSM estimators 
should yield the same results, because with growing sample size they all become 
closer to comparing only exact matches (Smith, 2000). However, in small samples the 
choice of the matching algorithm can be important (Heckman et al., 1997a), where 
usually a trade-off between bias and variance arises (see Table 1). So what advice 
can be given to researchers facing the problem of choosing a matching estimator? It </p>

<p>IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING </p>



<p>should be clear that there is no 'winner' for all situations and that the choice of the 
estimator crucially depends on the situation at hand. The performance of different 
matching estimators varies case-by-case and depends largely on the data structure at 
hand (Zhao, 2000). To give an example, if there are only a few control observations, 
it makes no sense to match without replacement. On the other hand, if there are a 
lot of comparable untreated individuals it might be worth using more than one NN 
(either by oversampling or KM) to gain more precision in estimates. Pragmatically, 
it seems sensible to try a number of approaches. Should they give similar results, 
the choice may be unimportant. Should results differ, further investigation may be 
needed in order to reveal more about the source of the disparity (Bryson et al.,  2002). </p>

<p>3.3 Overlap and Common Support </p>

<p>Our discussion in Section 2 has shown that ATT and ATE are only defined in the 
region of common support. Heckman et al. (1997a) point out that a violation of the 
common support condition is a major source of evaluation bias as conventionally 
measured. Comparing the incomparable must be avoided, i.e. only the subset of the 
comparison group that is comparable to the treatment group should be used in the 
analysis (Dehejia and Wahba, 1999). Hence, an important step is to check the overlap 
and the region of common support between treatment and comparison group. Several 
ways are suggested in the literature, where the most straightforward one is a visual 
analysis of the density distribution of the propensity score in both groups. Lechner  (2001b) argues that given that the support problem can be spotted by inspecting the 
propensity score distribution, there is no need to implement a complicated estimator. 
However, some guidelines might help the researcher to determine the region of 
common support more precisely. We will present two methods, where the first 
one is essentially based on comparing the minima and maxima of the propensity 
score in both groups and the second one is based on estimating the density 
distribution in both groups. Implementing the common support condition ensures 
that any combination of characteristics observed in the treatment group can also be 
observed among the control group (Bryson et al., 2002). For ATT it is sufficient to 
ensure the existence of potential matches in the control group, whereas for ATE it 
is additionally required that the combinations of characteristics in the comparison 
group may also be observed in the treatment group (Bryson et al., 2002). </p>

<p>Minima and Maxima Comparison </p>

<p>The basic criterion of this approach is to delete all observations whose propensity 
score is smaller than the minimum and larger than the maximum in the opposite 
group. To give an example let us assume for a moment that the propensity score 
lies within the interval [0.07, 0.94] in the treatment group and within [0.04, 0.89]  in the control group. Hence, with the 'minima and maxima criterion', the common 
support is given by [0.07, 0.89]. Observations which lie outside this region are 
discarded from analysis. Clearly a two-sided test is only necessary if the parameter </p>

<p>Journal of Economic Surveys (2008) Vol. 22, No. 1, pp. 31-72

<p>CALIENDO AND KOPEINIG </p>

<p>of interest is ATE; for ATT it is sufficient to ensure that for each participant 
a close nonparticipant can be found. It should also be clear that the common 
support condition is in some ways more important for the implementation of KM 
than it is for the implementation of NN matching, because with KM all untreated 
observations are used to estimate the missing counterfactual outcome, whereas with 
NN matching only the closest neighbour is used. Hence, NN matching (with the 
additional imposition of a maximum allowed caliper) handles the common support 
problem pretty well. There are some problems associated with the 'minima and 
maxima comparison', e.g. if there are observations at the bounds which are discarded 
even though they are very close to the bounds. Another problem arises if there are 
areas within the common support interval where there is only limited overlap between 
both groups, e.g. if in the region [0.51, 0.55] only treated observations can be found. 
Additionally problems arise if the density in the tails of the distribution is very thin, 
for example when there is a substantial distance from the smallest maximum to the 
second smallest element. Therefore, Lechner (2002) suggests to check the sensitivity 
of the results when the minima and maxima are replaced by the tenth smallest and 
tenth largest observation. </p>

<p>Trimming to Determine the Common Support </p>

<p>A different way to overcome these possible problems is described by Smith and  Todd (2005). 
13 They use a trimming procedure to determine the common support 
region and define the region of common support as those values of P that have 
positive density within both the D = 1 and D = 0 distributions, i.e. </p>

<p>S P = {P :f (P|D = 1) &gt; 0 andf (P|D = 0) &gt; 0} 
(7) </p>

<p>wheref (P|D = 1) &gt; 0 andf (P|D = 0) &gt; 0 are nonparametric density estimators. 
Any P points for which the estimated density is exactly zero are excluded. 
Additionally -to ensure that the densities are strictly positive -they require that 
the densities exceed zero by a threshold amount q. So not only the P points for 
which the estimated density is exactly zero, but also an additional q percent of the 
remaining P points for which the estimated density is positive but very low are 
excluded: </p>

<p>14Ŝ </p>

<p>Pq = {Pq :f (P|D = 1) &gt; q andf (P|D = 0) &gt; q} 
(8) </p>

<p>Figure 3 gives a hypothetical example and clarifies the differences between the 
two approaches. In the first example the propensity score distribution is highly 
skewed to the left (right) for participants (nonparticipants). Even though this is an 
extreme example, researchers are confronted with similar distributions in practice, 
too. With the 'minima and maxima comparison' we would exclude any observations 
lying outside the region of common support given by [0.2, 0.8]. Depending on the 
chosen trimming level q, we would maybe also exclude control observations in 
the interval [0.7, 0.8] and treated observations in the interval [0.2, 0.3] with the 
trimming approach since the densities are relatively low there. However, no large 
differences between the two approaches would emerge. In the second example we </p>

<p>IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING </p>



<p>Figure 3. The Common Support Problem. </p>

<p>do not find any control individuals in the region [0.4, 0.7]. The 'minima and maxima 
comparison' fails in that situation, since minima and maxima in both groups are equal 
at 0.01 and 0.99. Hence, no observations would be excluded based on this criterion 
making the estimation of treatment effects in the region [0.4, 0.7] questionable. The 
trimming method on the other hand would explicitly exclude treated observations 
in that propensity score range and would therefore deliver more reliable results. </p>

<p>15   Hence, the choice of the method depends on the data situation at hand and before 
making any decisions a visual analysis is recommended. </p>

<p>Failure of the Common Support </p>

<p>Once one has defined the region of common support, individuals that fall outside this 
region have to be disregarded and for these individuals the treatment effect cannot 
be estimated. Bryson et al. (2002) note that when the proportion of lost individuals 
is small, this poses few problems. However, if the number is too large, there may be 
concerns whether the estimated effect on the remaining individuals can be viewed 
as representative. It may be instructive to inspect the characteristics of discarded 
individuals since those can provide important clues when interpreting the estimated 
treatment effects. Lechner (2001b) notes that both ignoring the support problem and 
estimating treatment effects only within the common support (subgroup effects) may 
be misleading. He develops an approach that can be used to derive bounds for the 
true treatment effect and we describe this approach in detail in Section 3.9. </p>

<p>3.4 Assessing the Matching Quality </p>

<p>Since we do not condition on all covariates but on the propensity score, it has to be 
checked if the matching procedure is able to balance the distribution of the relevant 
variables in both the control and treatment group. Several procedures to do so will be 
discussed in this section. These procedures can also, as already mentioned, help in </p>

<p>CALIENDO AND KOPEINIG </p>

<p>determining which interactions and higher-order terms to include in the propensity 
score specification for a given set of covariates X. The basic idea of all approaches 
is to compare the situation before and after matching and check if there remain 
any differences after conditioning on the propensity score. If there are differences, 
matching on the score was not (completely) successful and remedial measures have 
to be done, e.g. by including interaction terms in the estimation of the propensity 
score. A helpful theorem in this context is suggested by Rosenbaum and Rubin  (1983b) and states that </p>

<p>X D|P(D = 1|X ) 
(9) </p>

<p>This means that after conditioning on P(D = 1|X ), additional conditioning on X 
should not provide new information about the treatment decision. Hence, if after 
conditioning on the propensity score there is still dependence on X, this suggests 
either mis-specification in the model used to estimate P(D = 1|X ) (see Smith  and Todd, 2005) or a fundamental lack of comparability between the two groups 
(Blundell et al., 2005). </p>

<p>16   Standardized Bias </p>

<p>One suitable indicator to assess the distance in marginal distributions of the X 
variables is the standardized bias (SB) suggested by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1985). 
For each covariate X it is defined as the difference of sample means in the treated 
and matched control subsamples as a percentage of the square root of the average 
of sample variances in both groups. The SB before matching is given by </p>

<p>SB before = 100 · 
X 1 − X 0 
√ 
0.5 · (V 1 (X ) + V 0 (X )) 
(10) </p>

<p>The SB after matching is given by </p>

<p>SB after = 100 · 
X 1M − X 0M 
√ 
0.5 · (V 1M (X ) + V 0M (X )) 
(11) </p>

<p>where X 1 (V 1 ) is the mean (variance) in the treatment group before matching and 
X 0 (V 0 ) the analogue for the control group. X 1M (V 1M ) and X 0M (V 0M ) are the 
corresponding values for the matched samples. This is a common approach used in 
many evaluation studies, e.g. by Lechner (1999), Sianesi (2004) and Caliendo et al.  (2007). One possible problem with the SB approach is that one does not have a clear 
indication for the success of the matching procedure, even though in most empirical 
studies an SB below 3% or 5% after matching is seen as sufficient. </p>

<p>t-Test </p>

<p>A similar approach uses a two-sample t-test to check if there are significant 
differences in covariate means for both groups (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1985). 
Before matching differences are expected, but after matching the covariates should 
be balanced in both groups and hence no significant differences should be found. The </p>

C 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation C 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd </p>

<p>IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING </p>



<p>t-test might be preferred if the evaluator is concerned with the statistical significance 
of the results. The shortcoming here is that the bias reduction before and after 
matching is not clearly visible. </p>

<p>Joint Significance and Pseudo-R </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>Additionally, Sianesi (2004) suggests to reestimate the propensity score on the 
matched sample, i.e. only on participants and matched nonparticipants, and compare 
the pseudo-R 
2 s before and after matching. The pseudo-R 
2 indicates how well the 
regressors X explain the participation probability. After matching there should be 
no systematic differences in the distribution of covariates between both groups and 
therefore the pseudo-R 
2 should be fairly low. Furthermore, one can also perform 
a likelihood ratio test on the joint significance of all regressors in the probit or 
logit model. The test should not be rejected before, and should be rejected after, 
matching. </p>

<p>Stratification Test </p>

<p>Finally, Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002) divide observations into strata based 
on the estimated propensity score, such that no statistically significant difference 
between the mean of the estimated propensity score in both treatment and control 
group remain. Then they use t-tests within each strata to test if the distribution of 
X variables is the same between both groups (for the first and second moments). If 
there are remaining differences, they add higher-order and interaction terms in the 
propensity score specification, until such differences no longer emerge. </p>

<p>This makes clear that an assessment of matching quality can also be used 
to determine the propensity score specification. If the quality indicators are not 
satisfactory, one reason might be mis-specification of the propensity score model 
and hence it may be worth taking a step back, including for example interaction 
or higher-order terms in the score estimation and testing the quality once again. If 
after respecification the quality indicators are still not satisfactory, it may indicate 
a fundamental lack of comparability of the two groups being examined. Since this 
is a precondition for a successful application of the matching strategy, alternative 
evaluation approaches should be considered (see for example the discussion in 
Blundell et al., 2005). 
It should also be noted that different matching estimators balance the covariates 
to different degrees. Hence, for a given estimation of the propensity score, how 
the different matching methods balance the covariates can be used as a criterion to 
choose among them (leaving efficiency considerations aside). </p>

<p>3.5 Choice-Based Sampling </p>

<p>An additional problem arising in evaluation studies is that samples used are 
often choice-based (Smith and Todd, 2005). This is a situation where programme 
participants are oversampled relative to their frequency in the population of eligible </p>

<p>Journal of Economic Surveys (2008) Vol. 22, No. 1, pp. 31-72 
C 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation C 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd </p>



<p>CALIENDO AND KOPEINIG </p>

<p>persons. This type of sampling design is frequently chosen in evaluation studies to 
reduce the costs of data collection and to get a larger number of treated individuals 
(Heckman and Todd, 2004). We discuss this point briefly and suggest one correction 
mechanism introduced by Heckman and Todd (2004). First of all, note that under 
choice-based sampling weights are required to consistently estimate the probability 
of programme participation. Since population weights are not known in most choice-
based datasets used in evaluation analysis the propensity score cannot be consistently 
estimated (Heckman and Todd, 2004). However, Heckman and Todd (2004) show 
that even with population weights unknown, matching methods can still be applied. 
This is the case because the odds ratio estimated using the incorrect weights (those 
that ignore the fact of choice-based samples) is a scalar multiple of the true odds ratio, 
which is itself a monotonic transformation of propensity scores. Hence, matching 
can be done on the (misweighted) estimate of the odds ratio (or of the log odds 
ratio). Clearly, with single NN matching it does not matter whether matching is 
performed on the odds ratio or the estimated propensity score (with wrong weights), 
since ranking of the observations is identical and therefore the same neighbours 
will be selected. However, for methods that take account of the absolute distance 
between observations, e.g. KM, it does matter (Smith and Todd, 2005). </p>

<p>3.6 When to Compare and Locking-in Effects </p>

<p>An important decision which has to be made in the empirical analysis is when to 
measure the effects. The major goal is to ensure that participants and nonparticipants 
are compared in the same economic environment and the same individual lifecycle 
position. For example, when evaluating labour market policies one possible problem 
which has to be taken into account is the occurrence of locking-in effects. The 
literature is dominated by two approaches, comparing the individuals either from 
the beginning of the programme or after the end of the programme. To give an 
example let us assume that a programme starts in January and ends in June. The 
latter of the two alternatives implies that the outcome of participants who reenter the 
labour market in July is compared with matched nonparticipants in July. There are 
two shortcomings to this approach. First, if the exits of participants are spread over 
a longer time period, it might be the case that very different economic situations 
are compared. Second, a further problem which arises with this approach is that it 
entails an endogeneity problem (Gerfin and Lechner, 2002), since the abortion of 
the programme may be caused by several factors which are usually not observed by 
the researcher. </p>

<p>17   The above mentioned second approach is predominant in the recent evaluation 
literature (see e.g. Gerfin and Lechner, 2002; Sianesi, 2004) and measures the effects 
from the beginning of the programme. One major argument to do so concerns the 
policy relevance. In the above example the policy maker is faced with the decision 
to put an individual in January in a programme or not. He will be interested in the 
effect of his decision on the outcome of the participating individual in contrast with 
the situation if the individual would not have participated. Therefore comparing 
both outcomes from the beginning of the programme is a reasonable approach. </p>

<p>What should be kept in mind, however, is the possible occurrence of locking-in 
effects for the group of participants. Since they are involved in the programme, 
they do not have the same time to search for a new job as nonparticipants. The 
net effect of a programme consists of two opposite effects. First, the increased 
employment probability through the programme, and second, the reduced search 
intensity. 
18 Since the two effects cannot be disentangled, we only observe the net 
effect and have to take this into account when interpreting the results. As to the 
fall in the search intensity, we should expect an initial negative effect from any 
kind of participation in a programme. However, a successful programme should 
overcompensate for this initial fall. So, if we are able to observe the outcome of 
the individuals for a reasonable time after the beginning/end of the programme, the 
occurrence of locking-in effects poses fewer problems but nevertheless has to be 
taken into account in the interpretation. </p>

<p>3.7 Estimating the Variance of Treatment Effects </p>

<p>Testing the statistical significance of treatment effects and computing their standard 
errors is not a straightforward thing to do. The problem is that the estimated variance 
of the treatment effect should also include the variance due to the estimation of 
the propensity score, the imputation of the common support and in the case of 
matching without replacement also the order in which the treated individuals are 
matched. These estimation steps add variation beyond the normal sampling variation 
(see the discussion in Heckman et al., 1998b). For example, in the case of NN 
matching with one NN, treating the matched observations as given will understate the 
standard errors (Smith, 2000). Things get more complicated, since a much discussed 
topic in the recent evaluation literature centres around efficiency bounds of the 
different approaches and how to reach them. The aim of this section is to provide 
a brief overview of this ongoing discussion and more importantly to describe three 
approaches for the estimation of standard errors which are frequently used in the 
empirical literature. </p>

<p>Efficiency and Large Sample Properties of Matching Estimators </p>

<p>The asymptotic properties of matching and weighting estimators have been studied 
by for example Hahn (1998), Heckman et al. (1998b) and Abadie and Imbens  (2006a). The results from Hahn (1998) are a good starting point for the efficiency 
discussion. He derives the semi-parametric efficiency bounds for ATE and ATT under 
various assumptions. He especially takes into account cases where the propensity 
score is known and where it has to be estimated. 
19 Under the unconfoundedness 
assumption the asymptotic variance bounds for ATE and ATT are given by </p>

<p>where σ </p>

<p>D (X ) are the conditional outcome variances for treated (D = 1) and 
untreated (D = 0) observations. 
There is an ongoing discussion in the literature on how the efficiency bounds 
are achieved and if the propensity score should be used for estimation of ATT 
and ATE or not. In the above cited paper Hahn (1998) shows that when using 
nonparametric series regression, adjusting for all covariates can achieve the efficiency 
bound, whereas adjusting for the propensity score does not. Hirano et al. (2003)  show that weighting with the inverse of a nonparametric estimate of the propensity 
score can achieve the efficiency bound, too. Angrist and Hahn (2004) use the results 
from Hahn (1998) as a starting point for their analysis and note that conventional 
asymptotic arguments would appear to offer no justification for anything other 
than full control for covariates in estimation of ATEs. However, they argue that 
conventional asymptotic results can be misleading and provide poor guidance for 
researchers who face a finite sample. They develop an alternative theory and 
propose a panel-style estimator which can provide finite-sample efficiency gains 
over covariate and propensity score matching. 
Heckman et al. (1998b) analyse large sample properties of LPM estimators for 
the estimation of ATT. They show that these estimators are 
√ 
n-consistent and 
asymptotically normally distributed. This holds true when matching with respect 
to X, the known propensity score or the estimated propensity score. They conclude 
that none of the approaches dominates the others per se. In the case of matching 
on the known propensity score, the asymptotic variance of Var ATT is not necessarily 
smaller than that when matching on X. </p>

<p>20   Abadie and Imbens (2006a) analyse the asymptotic efficiency of n nearest 
neighbour matching when n is fixed, i.e. when the number of neighbours does 
not grow with increasing sample size. They show that simple matching estimators 
include a conditional bias term of order O(N 
−1/k ), where k is the number of 
continuous covariates. The bias does not disappear if k equals 2 and will dominate 
the large sample variance if k is at least 3. Hence, these estimators do not reach 
the variance bounds in (12) and (13) and are inefficient. They also describe a bias 
correction that removes the conditional bias asymptotically, making estimators 
√ n-</p>

<p>consistent. Additionally, they suggest a new estimator for the variance that does not 
require consistent nonparametric estimation of unknown functions (we will present 
that approach further below). Imbens (2004) highlights some caveats of these results. 
First, it is important to make clear that only continuous covariates should be counted 
in dimension k, since with discrete covariates the matching will be exact in large 
samples. Second, if only treated individuals are matched and the number of potential 
controls is much larger than the number of treated individuals, it can be justified </p>

<p>IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING </p>



<p>to ignore the bias by appealing to an asymptotic sequence where the number of 
potential controls increases faster than the number of treated individuals. </p>

<p>Three Approaches for the Variance Estimation </p>

<p>There are a number of ways to estimate the variance of average treatment effects as 
displayed in equations (12) and (13). One is by 'brute force' (Imbens, 2004), i.e. by 
estimating the five components of the variance σ </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>0 (X ), σ </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>1 (X ), E(Y (1)|X ), E(Y (0)|X ) 
and P(X) using kernel methods or series. Even though this is consistently possible 
and hence the asymptotic variance will be consistent, too, Imbens (2004) notes that 
this might be an additional computational burden. Hence, practical alternatives are 
called for and we are going to present three of them. Two of them, bootstrapping and 
the variance approximation by Lechner (2001a), are very common in the applied 
literature. Additionally, we are going to present a new method from Abadie and  Imbens (2006a) that is based on the distinction between average treatment effects 
and sample average treatment effects. </p>

<p>Bootstrapping </p>

<p>One way to deal with this problem is to use bootstrapping as suggested for example 
by Lechner (2002). This method is a popular way to estimate standard errors in 
case analytical estimates are biased or unavailable. 
21 Even though Imbens (2004) 
notes that there is little formal evidence to justify bootstrapping and Abadie and  Imbens (2006b) even show that the standard bootstrap fails for the case of NN 
matching with replacement on a continuous covariate it is widely applied. An early 
example of use can be found in Heckman et al. (1997a) who report bootstrap standard 
errors for LLM estimators. Other application examples for bootstrapping are for 
example Black and Smith (2004) for NN and KM estimators or Sianesi (2004) in 
the context of caliper matching. Each bootstrap draw includes the reestimation of 
the results, including the first steps of the estimation (propensity score, common 
support, etc.). Repeating the bootstrapping R times leads to R bootstrap samples and 
R estimated average treatment effects. The distribution of these means approximates 
the sampling distribution (and thus the standard error) of the population mean. 
Clearly, one practical problem arises because bootstrapping is very time consuming 
and might therefore not be feasible in some cases. </p>

<p>Variance Approximation by Lechner: </p>

<p>An alternative is suggested by Lechner (2001a). For the estimated ATT obtained via 
NN matching the following formula applies: </p>

<p>Var(τ AT T ) = 
1 
N 1 
Var(Y (1) | D = 1) + 
j∈{D=0} (w j ) </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>(N 1 ) 2 
· Var(Y (0) | D = 0) </p>

<p>(14) </p>

<p>where N 1 is the number of matched treated individuals and w j is the number of 
times individual j from the control group has been used, i.e. this takes into account </p>

C 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation C 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd </p>



<p>CALIENDO AND KOPEINIG </p>

<p>that matching is performed with replacement. If no unit is matched more than once, 
the formula coincides with the 'usual' variance formula. By using this formula 
to estimate the variance of the treatment effect at time t, we assume independent 
observations and fixed weights. Furthermore we assume homoscedasticity of the 
variances of the outcome variables within treatment and control group and that the 
outcome variances do not depend on the estimated propensity score. This approach 
can be justified by simulation results from Lechner (2002) who finds little difference 
between bootstrapped variances and the variances calculated according to equation 
(14). </p>

<p>Variance Estimators by Abadie and Imbens </p>

<p>To introduce this variance estimator, some additional notation is needed. Abadie and 
Imbens (2006a) explicitly distinguish average treatment effects given in Section 2 
from sample average treatment effects. The latter estimators focus on the average 
treatment effects in the specific sample rather than in the population at large. Hence, 
the sample average treatment effect for the treated (SATT) is given by </p>

<p>τ S AT T = 
1 
N 1 i∈{D=1} 
[Y i (1) − Y i (0)] 
(15) </p>

<p>Abadie and Imbens (2006a) derived a matching variance estimator that does not 
require additional nonparametric estimation. The basic idea is that even though 
the asymptotic variance depends on the conditional variances σ </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>1 (X ) and σ </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>0 (X ), one 
actually need not estimate these variances consistently at all values of the covariates. 
Instead only the average of this variance over the distribution weighted by the inverse 
of P(X) and 1 − P(X ) is needed. The variance of SATT can then be estimated by </p>

<p>Var S AT T = 
1 
N 1 </p>

<p>i=1 </p>

<p>D i − (1 − D i ) ·

D i </p>

<p>(X i ) 
(16) </p>

<p>where M is the number of matches and K M (i) is the number of times unit i is used 
as a match. 
It should be noted that the estimation of the conditional variances requires 
estimation of conditional outcome variances σ </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>D (X i ). Abadie and Imbens (2006a) 
offer two options. With the first option one assumes that the treatment effect is 
constant for all individuals i and that σ </p>

<p>D (X i ) does not vary with X or D. This is the 
assumption of homoscedasticity, whereas heteroscedasticity is allowed in the second 
option, where it is explicitly allowed that σ </p>

<p>D (X i ) differ in D and X. </p>

<p>22   3.8 Combined and Other Propensity Score Methods </p>

<p>What we have discussed so far is the estimation of treatment effects under 
unconfoundedness with (propensity score) matching estimators. Imbens (2004) notes 
that one evaluation method alone is often sufficient to obtain consistent or even 
efficient estimates. However, combining evaluation methods is a straightforward </p>

<p>IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING </p>



<p>way to improve their performance by eliminating remaining bias and/or improving 
precision. In this section we address three combined methods. 
First, we introduce an estimator which combines matching with the DID approach. 
By doing so, a possible bias due to time-invariant unobservables is eliminated. 
Second, we present a regression-adjusted matching estimator that combines matching 
with regression. This can be useful because matching does not address the 
relation between covariates and outcome. Additionally, if covariates appear seriously 
imbalanced after propensity score matching (inexact or imperfect matching) a bias-
correction procedure after matching may help to improve estimates. Third, we 
present how weighting on the propensity score can be used to obtain a balanced 
sample of treated and untreated individuals. </p>

<p>23   Conditional DID or DID Matching Estimator </p>

<p>The matching estimator described so far assumes that after conditioning on a set of 
observable characteristics, (mean) outcomes are independent of programme partici-
pation. The conditional DID or DID matching estimator relaxes this assumption and 
allows for unobservable but temporally invariant differences in outcomes between 
participants and nonparticipants. This is done by comparing the conditional before-
after outcome of participants with those of nonparticipants. DID matching was first 
suggested by Heckman et al. (1998a). It extends the conventional DID estimator 
by defining outcomes conditional on the propensity score and using semiparametric 
methods to construct the differences. Therefore it is superior to DID as it does not 
impose linear functional form restrictions in estimating the conditional expectation of 
the outcome variable and it reweights the observations according to the weighting 
function of the matching estimator (Smith and Todd, 2005). If the parameter of 
interest is ATT, the DID propensity score matching estimator is based on the 
following identifying assumption: </p>

<p>E[Y t (0) − Y t (0)|P(X ), D = 1] = E[Y t (0) − Y t (0)|P(X ), D = 0] 
(17) </p>

<p>where (t) is the post-and (t ) is the pretreatment period. It also requires the common 
support condition to hold. If panel data on participants and nonparticipants are 
available, it can be easily implemented by constructing propensity score matching 
estimates in both periods and calculating the difference between them. 
24 Smith and  Todd (2005) find that such estimators are more robust than traditional cross-section 
matching estimators. </p>

<p>Regression-Adjusted and Bias-Corrected Matching Estimators </p>

<p>The regression-adjusted matching estimator (developed by Heckman et al., 1997a,  1998a) combines LLM on the propensity score with regression adjustment on 
covariates. By utilizing information on the functional form of outcome equations and 
by incorporating exclusion restrictions across outcome and participation equation, it 
extends classical matching methods. Heckman et al. (1998b) present a proof of 
consistency and asymptotic normality of this estimator. Navarro-Lozano (2002) </p>

<p>Journal of Economic Surveys (2008) Vol. 22, No. 1, pp. 31-72

<p>CALIENDO AND KOPEINIG </p>

<p>provides a nice example for an application by evaluating a popular training 
programme in Mexico. 
In cases where (substantial) differences in covariates between matched pairs 
remain after matching, additional regression adjustments may be helpful to reduce 
such differences. If matching is not exact, there will be some discrepancies that 
lead to a potential bias. The basic idea of the bias-correction estimators is to use 
the difference in the covariates to reduce the bias of the matching estimator. Rubin  (1973, 1979) first proposed several matched sample regression adjustments in the 
context of Mahalanobis metric matching and they have been more recently discussed 
by Abadie and Imbens (2006a) and Imbens (2004). </p>

<p>Weighting on the Propensity Score </p>

<p>Imbens (2004) notes that propensity scores can also be used as weights to obtain 
a balanced sample of treated and untreated individuals. 
25 Such estimators can be 
written as the difference between a weighted average of the outcomes for the 
treated and untreated individuals, where units are weighted by the reciprocal of 
the probability of receiving treatment. 
26 An unattractive feature of such estimators 
is that the weights do not necessarily add up to one. One approach to improve the 
propensity score weighting estimator is to normalize the weights to unity. If the 
propensity score is known, the estimator can directly by implemented. But, even 
in randomized settings where the propensity score is known, Hirano et al. (2003)  show that it could be advantageous in terms of efficiency considerations to use the 
estimated rather than the 'true' propensity score. However, as Zhao (2004) notes, 
the way propensity scores are estimated is crucial when implementing weighting 
estimators and mis-specification of the propensity score may lead to substantial 
bias. </p>

<p>27   3.9 Sensitivity Analysis </p>

<p>Checking the sensitivity of the estimated results becomes an increasingly important 
topic in the applied evaluation literature. We will address two possible topics for 
a sensitivity analysis in this section. First, we are going to discuss approaches that 
allow the researcher to assess the sensitivity of the results with respect to deviations 
from the identifying assumption. Second, we show how to incorporate information 
from those individuals who failed the common support restriction to calculate bounds 
of the parameter of interest (if all individuals from the sample at hand would have 
been included). </p>

<p>Deviations from Unconfoundedness or Unobserved Heterogeneity </p>

<p>We have outlined in Section 2 that the estimation of treatment effects with matching 
estimators is based on the unconfoundedness or selection on observables assumption. 
However, if there are unobserved variables which affect assignment into treatment 
and the outcome variable simultaneously, a 'hidden bias' might arise (Rosenbaum, </p>

<p>Journal of Economic Surveys (2008) Vol. 22, No. 1, pp. 31-72 
C 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation C 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd </p>

<p>IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING </p>



<p>2002). It should be clear that matching estimators are not robust against this 
'hidden bias'. Researchers become increasingly aware that it is important to test 
the robustness of results to departures from the identifying assumption. Since it is 
not possible to estimate the magnitude of selection bias with nonexperimental data, 
the problem can be addressed by sensitivity analysis. Even though the idea for such 
analyses reaches far back in the literature only a few applied studies take them into 
account. However, it seems that this topic has come back into the mind of applied 
researchers and will become more important in the next few years. The aim of this 
section is to give a brief overview of some of the suggested methods. </p>

<p>28   One of the earliest examples for sensitivity analysis in the evaluation context can 
be found in Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983a). They propose to assess the sensitivity 
of ATE with respect to assumptions about an unobserved binary covariate that is 
associated both with the treatment and the response. The basic idea is that treatment 
is not unconfounded given the set of observable characteristics X but would be 
unconfounded given X and an unobservable covariate U. Based on different sets of 
assumptions about the distribution of U and its association with D and the outcomes 
Y (0) and Y (1) it is then possible to check the sensitivity of the results with respect 
to variations in these assumptions. 
Imbens (2003) builds on this approach but does not formulate the sensitivity in 
terms of coefficients on the unobserved covariate and rather presents the sensitivity 
results in terms of partial R 
2 s. This eases the interpretation and additionally allows 
a comparison of the partial R 
2 s of the unobserved covariates to those for the 
observed covariates in order to facilitate judgements regarding the plausibility of 
values necessary to substantially change results obtained under exogeneity. Both 
approaches use a parametric model as the basis for estimating ATEs. Parametrization 
is not needed, however, in the following two approaches. 
The first approach was proposed by Rosenbaum (2002) and has been recently 
applied in Aakvik (2001), DiPrete and Gangl (2004) and Caliendo et al. (2007). 
The basic question to be answered here is whether inference about treatment effects 
may be altered by unobserved factors. In other words, one wants to determine how 
strongly an unmeasured variable must influence the selection process in order to 
undermine the implications of matching analysis. To do so it is assumed that the 
participation probability π i is not only determined by observable factors (x i ) but 
also by an unobservable component (u i ): π i = Pr(D i = 1 | x i ) = F(βx i + γ u i ). γ 
is the effect of u i on the participation decision. Clearly, if the study is free of hidden 
bias, γ will be zero and the participation probability will solely be determined by x i . 
However, if there is hidden bias, two individuals with the same observed covariates 
x have differing chances of receiving treatment. Varying the value of γ allows the 
researcher to assess the sensitivity of the results with respect to 'hidden bias'. Based 
on that, bounds for significance levels and confidence intervals can be derived. 
(For details see Rosenbaum (2002) and Aakvik (2001). Becker and Caliendo (2007)  provide an implementation in Stata). 
A different approach was recently proposed by Ichino et al. (2006). It additionally 
allows assessment of the sensitivity of point estimates and specifically the sensitivity 
of ATT matching estimates. They derive point estimates of the ATT under different </p>

<p>Journal of Economic Surveys (2008) Vol. 22, No. 1, pp. 31-72 
C 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation C 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd </p>



<p>CALIENDO AND KOPEINIG </p>

<p>possible scenarios of deviation from unconfoundedness. To do so they impose values 
of the parameters that characterize the distribution of U. Given these parameters, the 
value of the confounding factor for each treated and control subject is predicted and 
the ATT is reestimated now including the influence of the simulated U in the set of 
matching variables. By changing the assumptions about the distribution of U, they 
can assess the robustness of the ATT with respect to different hypotheses on the 
nature of the confounding factor. Their approach also allows one to verify whether 
there exists a set of plausible assumptions on U under which the estimated ATT 
would be driven to zero by the inclusion of U in the matching set. By modelling the 
nature of U based on already existing variables in the data, it is possible to assess 
the robustness of the estimates with respect to deviations from unconfoundedness 
that would occur if observed factors were omitted from the matching set. 
A somewhat different strategy is to focus on estimating the causal effect of a 
treatment that is known to have a zero effect, e.g. by relying on the presence of 
multiple control groups (see the discussion in Imbens (2004) for details). If one 
has a group of eligible and ineligible nonparticipants, the 'treatment effect' which 
is known to be zero can be estimated using only the two control groups (where 
the 'treatment' indicator then has to be a dummy for belonging in one of the two 
groups). Any nonzero effect implies that at least one of the control groups is invalid. 
However, as Imbens (2004) points out, not rejecting the test does not imply that the 
unconfoundedness assumption is valid, but makes it more plausible that it holds. A 
good example of such a comparison can be found in Heckman et al. (1997a). 
Overall, it should be noted that none of the tests can directly justify the 
unconfoundedness assumption. However, they provide some scope for making the 
estimates more credible if the results are not sensitive to different assumptions 
about unobservables factors. Clearly, if the results turn out to be very sensitive the 
researcher might have to think about the validity of his/her identifying assumption 
and consider alternative strategies. In any case, these tests should be applied more 
frequently. </p>

<p>Failure of Common Support </p>

<p>In Section 3.3 we have presented possible approaches to implement the common 
support restriction. Those individuals that fall outside the region of common support 
have to be disregarded. But, deleting such observations yields an estimate that is only 
consistent for the subpopulation within the common support. However, information 
from those outside the common support could be useful and informative especially 
if treatment effects are heterogeneous. 
Lechner (2001b) describes an approach to check the robustness of estimated 
treatment effects due to failure of common support. He incorporates information 
from those individuals who failed the common support restriction to calculate 
nonparametric bounds of the parameter of interest, if all individuals from the sample 
at hand would have been included. To introduce his approach some additional 
notation is needed. Define the population of interest with which is some subset 
from the space defined by treatment status (D = 1 or D = 0) and a set of covariates </p>

ATT is defined by {(D = 1) × X } and W

<p>Lechner (2001b) states that either ignoring the common support problem or 
estimating ATT only for the subpopulation within the common support can both be 
misleading. He recommends to routinely compute bounds analysis in order to assess 
the sensitivity of estimated treatment effects with respect to the common support 
problem and its impact on the inference drawn from subgroup estimates. </p>

<p>3.10 More Practical Issues and Recent Developments </p>

<p>Before we conclude the paper in the next section, we will point out some additional 
topics which might be of relevance in applied research. What we have discussed 
so far is basically a static and binary evaluation framework where an individual 
can participate in one programme (or not). However, in most realistic evaluation 
settings this framework might not be appropriate, e.g. when evaluating the effects 
of labour market policies. First of all, researchers are usually not confronted with 
only one, but a different set of programmes (programme heterogeneity). Second, an 
unemployed can successively enter into different programmes as long as (s)he is 
unemployed. Finally, choosing the right control group and the problem of random 
programme starts is a recently much discussed topic in the evaluation literature, 
too. These issues as well as a short listing of available software tools to implement 
matching are discussed in this section. </p>

<p>Programme Heterogeneity </p>

<p>The standard evaluation framework as presented in Section 2 considers only two 
possible states for each individual, i.e. participation and nonparticipation. To account 
for programme heterogeneity, this approach has been extended by Imbens (2000)  and Lechner (2001a) to the multiple treatment framework which considers the case 
of L + 1 mutually different and exclusive treatments. For every individual only 
one component of the L + 1 different outcomes {Y (0), Y (1), . . . , Y (L)} can be 
observed, leaving L as counterfactuals. Participation in treatment l is indicated by 
D ∈ {0, 1, . . . , L}. The interest lies in the causal effect of one treatment relative 
to another treatment on an outcome variable. Even though Lechner (2001a) defines 
several parameters of interest, we will focus once again on the ATT. In the multiple 
treatment notation, that effect is defined as a pairwise comparison of the effects 
of the treatments m and l for an individual randomly drawn from the group of 
participants in m only: </p>

<p>τ </p>

<p>ml </p>

<p>AT T = E[Y (m) − Y (l) | D = m] = E[Y (m) | D = m] − E[Y (l) | D = m] (20)   As discussed in Section 2, the causal treatment effect in the presented framework 
is not identified. To overcome the counterfactual situation, the unconfoundedness 
assumption has to be adapted to the multiple treatment framework: </p>

<p>Y (0), Y (1), . . . , Y (L) 
D | X 
(21) </p>

<p>This assumption can be weakened when one is interested in pairwise programme 
comparisons only. If we further assume that those receiving treatment m have 
a counterpart in the comparison group, i.e. if there is common support, the 
counterfactual mean can be constructed as E[Y (l) | D = m, X ]. Lechner (2001a)  also shows that the generalization of the balancing property holds for the case of 
multiple treatments as well. To estimate τ </p>

<p>ml </p>

<p>ATT matching can be done by using the 
conditional choice probability of treatment m given either treatment m or l and 
covariates X as a balancing score: </p>

<p>P(D = m | X , D ∈ {m, l}) = 
P(D = m | X ) 
P(D = m | X ) + P(D = l | X ) 
(22) </p>

<p>If the conditional choice probability is modelled directly, no information from 
subsamples other than those containing participants in m and l is needed and one 
is basically back in the binary treatment framework. Since the choice probabilities 
will not be known a priori, they have to be replaced by an estimate, e.g. a probit 
model. If all values of m and l are of interest, the whole sample is needed for 
identification. In that case either the binary conditional probabilities can be estimated 
or a structural approach can be used where a complete choice problem is formulated 
in one model and estimated on the full sample, e.g. with a multinomial probit model. 
We have discussed the (dis-)advantages of the multinomial modelling in comparison 
to discrete estimation of binomial models already in Section 3.1. </p>

<p>IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING </p>



<p>Sequential Matching Estimators </p>

<p>Extending the standard evaluation framework for the case where individuals can 
participate in subsequent treatments has been recently proposed by Lechner and  Miquel (2005). 
30 These 'programme careers' cannot be addressed properly in 
the basic framework. Problems occur because the assignment into a subsequent 
programme is not independent of the assignment into previous programmes. 
Additionally, outcomes in subsequent periods will be influenced by previous 
participation decisions. Hence, a dynamic selection problem arises. Most empirical 
work about dynamic selection problems ignores intermediate outcomes and treats 
the sequence participation as being determined from the start. Mainly, problems are 
circumvented by either estimating the effect of the first programme only (see e.g. 
Gerfin and Lechner, 2002) or applying the static framework subsequently (see e.g. 
Bergemann et al., 2001). The sequential matching framework is a powerful tool 
and is applicable for situations where individuals can participate more than once 
in a programme and where it is possible to identify treatment sequences. It allows 
intermediate outcomes to play a role in the participation decision for sequential 
participation and thus allows estimation in a dynamic context. To our knowledge 
Lechner (2004) is the only application so far and hence practical experiences with 
sequential matching estimators are rather limited. </p>

<p>Choosing the Right Control Group -Random Programme Starts </p>

<p>Another important topic in applied evaluation research is to choose an appropriate 
control group. In the 'usual' evaluation set-up for matching estimators, we have 
a group of participants and a group of nonparticipants. Both groups are usually 
observed from a certain starting point t to an end point T. The researcher does not 
have any information outside this limited time interval. Controls are defined as those 
individuals who did not participate in any programme in [t, T ], whereas participants 
are those individuals who took part in a programme for a certain interval τ in [t, T ]. 
In a series of papers, Sianesi (2001, 2004) casts doubt if this standard approach is 
appropriate. She suggests a solution which is based on a redefinition of the control 
group. Instead of defining controls as those who never participate, she defines 
controls as those who did not participate until a certain time period. Hence, the 
corresponding parameter of interest in this setting is then defined as the effect of 
joining a programme now in contrast to waiting longer. Fredriksson and Johansson  (2004) formalize her approach and argue that the standard way of defining a control 
group might lead to biased results, because the unconfoundedness assumption might 
be violated. The reason for this is that in the standard approach the treatment 
indicator itself is defined conditional on future outcomes. In fact, in the context 
of labour market policies it can be argued that an unemployed individual will join a 
programme at some time, provided his unemployment spell is long enough (Sianesi,  2004). Hence, if the reason for nonparticipation is that the individual has found a 
job before a participation in the programme was offered or considered, it leads to 
negatively biased effects. </p>

<p>Available Software to Implement Matching </p>

<p>The bulk of software tools to implement matching and estimate treatment effects is 
growing and allows researchers to choose the appropriate tool for their purposes. The 
most commonly used platform for these tools is <rs type="software">Stata</rs> and we will present the three 
most distributed ones here. Becker and Ichino (2002) provide a programme for PSM 
estimators (pscore, attnd, attnw, attr, atts, attk) which includes estimation routines for 
NN, kernel, radius, and stratification matching. To obtain standard errors the user can 
choose between bootstrapping and the variance approximation proposed by Lechner  (2001a). Additionally the authors offer balancing tests (blocking, stratification) as 
discussed in Section 3.4. 
Leuven and Sianesi (2003) provide the programme psmatch2 for implementing 
different kinds of matching estimators including covariate and propensity score 
matching. It includes NN and caliper matching (with and without replacement), KM, 
radius matching, LLM and Mahalanobis metric (covariate) matching. Furthermore, 
this programme includes routines for common support graphing (psgraph) and 
covariate imbalance testing (pstest). Standard errors are obtained using bootstrapping 
methods. 
Finally, Abadie et al. (2004) offer the programme nnmatch for implementing 
covariate matching, where the user can choose between several different distance 
metrics. Variance approximations as proposed by Abadie and Imbens (2006a) are 
implemented to obtain standard errors of treatment effects. </p>

<p>4. Conclusion </p>

<p>The aim of this paper was to give some guidance for the implementation of 
propensity score matching. Basically five implementation steps have to be considered 
when using PSM (as depicted in Figure 1). The discussion has made clear that a 
researcher faces a lot of decisions during implementation and that it is not always 
an easy task to give recommendations for a certain approach. Table 2 summarizes 
the main findings of this paper and also highlights sections where information for 
each implementation step can be found. 
The first step of implementation is the estimation of the propensity score. We 
have shown that the choice of the underlying model is relatively unproblematic in 
the binary case whereas for the multiple treatment case one should either use a 
multinomial probit model or a series of binary probits (logits). After having decided 
about which model to be used, the next question concerns the variables to be included 
in the model. We have argued that the decision should be based on economic theory, 
a sound knowledge of previous research and also information about the institutional 
settings. We have also presented several statistical strategies which may help to 
determine the choice. If it is felt that some variables play a specifically important 
role in determining participation and outcomes, one can use an 'overweighting' 
strategy, for example by carrying out matching on subpopulations. 
The second implementation step is the choice among different matching algo-
rithms. We have argued that there is no algorithm which dominates in all data </p>

<p>situations and that the choice involves a trade-off between bias and efficiency. 
The performance of different matching algorithms varies case-by-case and depends 
largely on the data sample. If results among different algorithms differ substantially, 
further investigations may be needed to reveal the source of disparity. 
The discussion has also emphasized that treatment effects can only be estimated in 
the region of common support. To identify this region we recommend to start with a 
visual analysis of the propensity score distributions in the treatment and comparison 
group. Based on that, different strategies can be applied to implement the common 
support condition, e.g. by 'minima and maxima comparison' or 'trimming', where 
the latter approach has some advantages when observations are close to the 'minima 
and maxima' bounds and if the density in the tails of the distribution is very thin. 
Since we do not condition on all covariates but on the propensity score we have to 
check in the next step if the matching procedure is able to balance the distribution of 
these covariates in the treatment and comparison group. We have presented several 
procedures to do so, including SB, t-test, stratification test, joint significance and 
pseudo-R 
2 . If the quality indicators are not satisfactory, one should go back to step 
1 of the implementation procedure and include higher-order or interaction terms of 
the existing covariates or choose different covariates (if available). If, after that, the 
matching quality is still not acceptable, this may indicate a lack of comparability 
of the two groups being examined. Since this is a precondition for a successful 
application of the matching estimator, one has to consider alternative evaluation 
approaches. 
However, if the matching quality is satisfactory one can move on to estimate the 
treatment effects. The estimation of standard errors is a much discussed topic in the 
recent evaluation literature. We have briefly discussed (some) efficiency and large 
sample properties of matching estimators and highlighted that the discussion in this 
direction is not final yet. Keeping that in mind, we have introduced three approaches 
for the estimation of variances of treatment effects which are used, i.e. bootstrapping 
methods, the variance approximation proposed in Lechner (2001a) and the variance 
estimators proposed by Abadie and Imbens (2006a). Another important decision is 
'when to measure the effects?' where we argue that it is preferable to measure the 
effects from the beginning of the treatment. Clearly, what has to be kept in mind 
for the interpretation is the possible occurrence of locking-in effects. 
Finally, a last step of matching analysis is to test the sensitivity of results with 
respect to deviations from the identifying assumption, e.g. when there are unobserved 
variables which affect assignment into treatment and the outcome variable leading to 
a 'hidden bias'. We have pointed out that matching estimators are not robust against 
this bias and that researchers become increasingly aware that it is important to test the 
sensitivity of their results. If the results are sensitive and if the researcher has doubts 
about the validity of the unconfoundedness assumption he should either consider 
using alternative identifying assumptions or combine PSM with other evaluation 
approaches. 
We have introduced some possible combinations in Section 3.8 where we 
presented the DID matching estimator, which eliminates a possible bias due to time-
invariant unobservables, as well as regression-adjusted and bias-corrected matching </p>

<p>estimators. All approaches aim to improve the performance of the estimates by 
eliminating remaining bias and/or improving precision. Last, in Section 3.10 we 
discussed some additional topics which might be of relevance in applied research, 
e.g. programme heterogeneity, sequential matching estimators and the choice of the 
right control group. 
To conclude, we have discussed several issues surrounding the implementation of 
PSM. We hope to give some guidance for researchers who believe that their data are 
strong enough to credibly justify the unconfoundedness assumption and who want 
to use PSM. </p>

combine weighting on propensity score estimators with other methods. Due to space

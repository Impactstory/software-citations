<p>The fact that European governments have grown dramatically since the end of 
World War II cannot be questioned. In 1960, government expenditures on 
average amounted to 27 percent of output, while in recent years their average 
size has reached almost half of the GDP (Mueller 2003; Persson 2002). In light 
of the heavy tax burden that a representative European citizen is consequently 
facing, it needs to be established why European governments can raise and 
enforce a claim to such a considerable share of private income. The benefit 
principle of taxation provides an answer to this question by stating that 
tax collection by a government is justified if society at large receives an ade-
quate reimbursement in the form of publicly provided goods and services 
(Lindahl 1919). The empirical analysis in this paper tests whether the benefit 
principle is fulfilled by studying the net effect of government size on subjective 
well-being. 
How well-being is affected by the public sector depends on the objectives and 
motives of politicians and bureaucrats. The traditional welfare economic view 
assumes the existence of a benevolent and omniscient social planner who 
exclusively seeks to maximize social welfare and ensures the achievement of a 
first-best allocation of resources. However, this view has been challenged by the 
public choice school, which emphasizes agency problems as the source of 
inefficient outcomes. One of the main ideas of this school of thought is that 
politicians and bureaucrats pursue personal interests that give rise to a </p>

<p>deviation from the optimal size of the public sector (Mueller 2003). Thus, by 
exploring how government size affects life satisfaction one is indirectly testing 
whether this kind of self-serving behavior is observed in reality. 
To date, only few researchers have investigated the relationship 
between public spending and well-being. Firstly, Bjørnskov et al. (2007) 
conduct a worldwide cross-country study and find that life satisfaction 
decreases with government consumption, whereas government capital forma-
tion and social spending appear to be irrelevant to subjective well-being. 
This would suggest that the aforementioned benefit principle of taxation is 
violated with respect to government consumption. 1 However, Di Tella and 
MacCulloch (2005) 2 find a positive but insignificant effect of government 
consumption on life satisfaction in a panel analysis for ten OECD countries. 
Hence, the existing literature presents ambiguous findings with regard to 
government consumption. 
Another group of researchers studies the influence of specific types of 
government expenditures on well-being and presents equally conflictive 
evidence. Veenhoven (2000) investigates the relationship between social 
security expenditures and well-being for a worldwide set of countries and finds 
no significant correlation between the two. As an extension, Ouweneel (2002) 
tests the hypothesis that at least the unemployed should experience higher 
average well-being in nations that spend a large percentage of GDP on welfare. 
However, he finds that while larger welfare states generally do achieve lower 
levels of income inequality, this does not have a significant effect on the 
subjective well-being of the unemployed. 
On the other hand, there are three studies suggesting that specific compo-
nents of public spending do affect subjective well-being. Radcliff (2001) 
presents cross-country evidence for a statistically significant positive effect of 
generous welfare spending on average happiness. In addition, Di Tella et al. 
(2003) find that higher unemployment benefits have led to an increase in 
national well-being in European countries over the 1975-1992 period. Finally, 
Kotakorpi and Laamanen's (2010) investigation reveals that there is a positive 
effect of health expenditures on subjective well-being when controlling for 
respondents' health status. Summarizing, there is some evidence that not only 
government consumption but also the magnitudes of individual expenditure 
components influence well-being, even though these studies are ambiguous 
regarding the significance of the observed effects. </p>

<p>1. On the other hand, the benefit principle concerning social transfers and capital formation is fulfilled. 
With regard to total spending it may also be fulfilled. However, the authors do not include total 
expenditures in the estimations. 
2. Di Tella and MacCulloch (2005) use government consumption as a control variable when they 
investigate the impact of inflation and unemployment on the well-being of left-and right-wing voters. </p>

<p>THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING IN EUROPE </p>

<p>In line with the aforementioned studies and other investigations in the 
field of Happiness Research, this paper uses life satisfaction as a proxy for 
well-being. More specifically, it draws on a rich micro dataset based on 
the Eurobarometer Survey Series and covers twelve EU countries 3 
from 1990 to 2000. Bjørnskov et al.'s (2007) study suffers from the shortcoming 
that the heterogeneity in a world-wide cross-sectional study of countries 
such as Venezuela, Vietnam, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Uganda cannot be 
captured by just a few control variables. In addition, it is questionable 
whether the dependent variable of subjective well-being can be compared 
across such a heterogeneous set of countries (Diener and Oishi 2006). 4 There-
fore, this study regards a relatively homogeneous set of EU countries and uses 
country fixed effects in the regression analysis. Moreover, as an extension to 
previous studies the analysis accounts for nonlinear effects given that the 
neglect of nonlinearities may be responsible for the ambiguity in the existing 
literature. 
This paper suggests that the effect of government size on well-being follows 
an inverse U-shape and that the effect of public sector size on well-being 
depends positively on the extent of decentralization and negatively on the level 
of corruption. In addition, left-wing voters and low-income earners appear to 
be the main beneficiaries of a large public sector. Further insights are gained by 
considering components of public spending that characterize the welfare state 
in a wider sense: education, health and social protection expenditures (Blom-
quist and Christiansen 1995; Boadway and Marchand 1995 5 ). These additional 
estimations bring to light that governments in the EU could have achieved 
higher levels of well-being by spending more on education and less on social 
protection. Summarizing, this paper makes a contribution to the literature by 
providing a comprehensive analysis on the impact of both the size and the 
composition of public expenditures on well-being while taking into account 
respondents' characteristics and institutional factors. 
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section II gives an 
overview of theoretical considerations and states four hypotheses. Section III 
describes the dataset and presents the empirical strategy, while section IV 
reports the results for the estimations and three robustness checks. Finally, 
section V concludes the analysis. </p>

<p>3. The countries included in the dataset are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, 
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK. 
4. This paper points out that cultural factors such as the desirability of pleasant emotions or self-criticism 
influence reports of subjective well-being. Thus, nations such as Japan have lower scores than one 
might expect based on observable factors such as income. 
5. Both groups of authors argue that governments primarily seek to achieve their redistributive goals 
through public expenditures on education, health care and pensions. </p>

<p>II. THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS </p>

<p>According to the traditional welfare economic view a benevolent social planner 
representing the government ensures a first-best allocation of resources. For 
instance, Pigou (1947) argues in favor of a corrective tax in the presence of 
externalities, whereas Samuelson (1954) states the condition for the optimal 
quantity of a public good. If public decision-makers comply with these 
optimality conditions, marginal costs and marginal benefits of government 
size just outweigh each other in equilibrium. These considerations are 
summarized in the following ceteris paribus statement: </p>

<p>H1a: Well-being is not affected by government size. </p>

<p>The underlying assumptions of the traditional welfare economic view, i.e. 
perfect information and welfare-maximizing governments, are discarded by 
proponents of the public choice school. Instead, they highlight inefficiencies 
and sub-optimal outcomes caused by the propensity of politicians and bureau-
crats to maximize their personal utility. As a result, the public choice school 
suggests that the public sector is excessively large and that resources are 
misallocated. The literature describes several causes for these inefficiencies. 
Many of them can be attributed to specific interest groups and the ways in 
which they succeed in pushing through their interests. In his seminal contribu-
tion, Tullock (1959) addresses the existence of the logrolling phenomenon, 
which may lead to the implementation of public projects that benefit specific 
interest groups but not society at large. In addition, Persson and Tabellini 
(2000) discuss models focusing on legislative bargaining, lobbying and electoral 
competition that illustrate additional mechanisms for an inefficient and 
asymmetric allocation of publicly provided goods and services. 
The behavior of bureaucrats and politicians provides another cause for 
excessive and inefficient public spending. Firstly, Niskanen (1971) puts forward 
a theoretical model illustrating bureaucrats' incentive to expand budgets 
beyond the social optimum since their non-pecuniary goals such as prestige 
and power are positively correlated with larger budgets for the provision of 
public goods. Hence, in the presence of an information asymmetry concerning 
the cost function of the public good the bureaucrat demands the largest budget, 
which the politician would approve of. As an alternative to this, Brennan and 
Buchanan (1980) depict the government as a Leviathan that maximizes its 
revenue by exploiting the tax base to the full extent. Eventually, this leads to 
excessively large budgets. Finally, Nordhaus (1975) discusses the existence of 
political business cycles where politicians -portrayed as maximizers of re-
election probabilities -implement expansionary fiscal policies (such as increases 
in government spending) before elections in order to boost their popularity. </p>

<p>r 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. </p>



<p>THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING IN EUROPE </p>

<p>Since it is unpleasant for politicians and voters to pursue fiscal consolidation 
after the elections, governments remains excessively large. 6 It follows that: </p>

<p>H1b: Well-being is negatively affected by government size. </p>

<p>As with every other policy variable the size of the public sector is likely to affect 
well-defined population groups in different ways. The most important indivi-
dual characteristics in this context are ideology and relative income. Firstly, a 
large public sector is more likely to be welcomed by individuals who express a 
preference for left-wing policy, i.e. large government size. Secondly, people 
who earn a relatively low income should benefit more from a large public sector 
as they are more likely to receive transfers and bear a comparably lower tax 
burden than high-income earners. Both propositions can be traced back to 
Meltzer and Richard's (1981) theoretical explanation for the size of govern-
ment by means of a median voter model. In sum, these considerations motivate 
the following hypothesis: </p>

<p>H2: Government size has a more positive impact on well-being for people who have 
left-wing ideological preferences or who rank low in the income distribution. </p>

<p>Additionally, it is worthwhile to take into account the role of institutional 
factors. In particular, the empirical analysis incorporates two factors, which are 
related to the efficient allocation of public resources. The first one is corruption, 
which is defined as the 'misuse of public office for private gain' (Svensson 2005, 
p. 20). The inclusion of corruption in the regression analysis can be justified by 
referring to the evidence on corruption-induced distortions in the allocation of 
public funds (Gupta et al. 2001; Mauro 1998). 
Secondly, expenditure decentralization is likely to play a role in the relation-
ship between government size and well-being even though the effect may go 
either way. Positive effects are usually attributed to an increase in efficiency 
through 'yardstick competition' (Besley and Case 1995) and a better targeted 
satisfaction of people's preferences (Oates 1972), whereas opponents of 
decentralization emphasize a more difficult coordination of efforts (Prud'-
homme 1995). In hypothesis 3, the dominance of the benefits of decentraliza-
tion is presumed since there is previous evidence for a positive effect of 
decentralization and local autonomy on well-being (Bjørnskov et al. 2008; 
Frey and Stutzer 2000a 7 ). These considerations imply: </p>

<p>6. For empirical evidence regarding political business cycles in government spending see Persson (2002) 
and Schuknecht (2000). 
7. Frey and Stutzer (2000a) find that local autonomy of Swiss cantons leads to higher well-being through 
political outcomes that are closer to people's preferences and procedural utility from political 
participation possibilities. </p>

<p>ZOHAL HESSAMI </p>

<p>H3: Government size has a more positive impact on well-being in countries 
characterized by a high extent of expenditure decentralization or a low 
level of corruption. </p>

<p>The final hypothesis explores whether the composition of the public budget 
matters. Previous investigations of this question (Di Tella et al. 2003; Ouweneel 
2002; Radcliff 2001; Veenhoven 2000) have only considered the effect of social 
transfers, while we embrace a wider definition of the welfare state by also taking 
into account the public provision of private goods such as education and 
health. These can be viewed as in-kind transfers to low-income earners. Based 
on these considerations we formulate the following hypothesis: </p>

<p>H4: For a given size of the public sector higher well-being can be observed when a 
large share of the budget is spent on education, health and social protection. </p>

<p>To summarize, the objective for the rest of the paper is to test four hypotheses, 
which relate to the impact of public sector size on well-being. To allow for more 
depth in the analysis we make a distinction between several population groups 
and factor in different characteristics of the government and the shares of 
public spending that are allocated to redistributive purposes. </p>

<p>III. DATA AND MODEL SPECIFICATION </p>

<p>1. Data description </p>

<p>In order to test the hypotheses stated in the previous section, the empirical 
analysis relies on a dataset covering 153,268 respondents from twelve EU 
countries over the time period between 1990 and 2000 8 . The data for the 
individual-level variables are derived from the Eurobarometer Survey Series. 
Next to the dependent variable (life satisfaction) this includes a number of 
control variables: gender, age, ideological preferences, relative income, marital 
status, education level, employment status and the number of children. The 
sample of respondents for each Eurobarometer Survey is drawn based on a 
multi-stage, random probability procedure and is hence designed to convey a 
representative picture of the population aged fifteen years and over in the EU 
member states. The interviews were organized by research firms under the </p>

<p>8. The analysis is limited to this time period for several reasons. First, OECD data on government 
spending is not available before 1990. Second, some variables in the Eurobarometer Survey Series are 
not available after 2000: The number of children is not recorded from 2001 to 2003, while the same 
applies to relative income from 2004 to 2007. </p>

<p>direction of the European Commission and were conducted in a face-to-face 
setting in people's homes and in the appropriate national language. 
The data for the life satisfaction variable is based on the question 'On the 
whole, are you very satisfied, fairly satisfied, not very satisfied or not at all 
satisfied with the life you lead?' (the small number of respondents answering 
'Don't know' and 'No answer' is ignored) measured on a scale that runs from 1 
to 4, where a higher value indicates a higher level of satisfaction. Several 
findings in the economic and psychological literature justify using this data. 
First, there is mounting evidence that self-reported well-being is correlated with 
physical reactions such as the frequency of smiling (Ekman et al. 1990; Pavot 
et al. 1991) or heart rate and blood pressure reactions to stress (Shedler et al. 
1993). Second, people's perceptions of their own well-being coincide with recall 
of positive events in life (Seidlitz et al. 1997) and reports of relatives and friends 
(Diener 1984; Sandvik et al. 1993). Third, experimental studies reject the 
hypothesis that subjects bias their response upwards due to social desirability 
(Konow and Earley 2008). Finally, data on subjective well-being has been 
shown to be negatively correlated with suicide in individual-level multivariate 
regressions (Daly and Wilson 2009). 
Figure 1 displays values for life satisfaction and government size for twelve 
EU countries averaged across the time period from 1990 to 2000 (and the 
individuals in a particular country). Denmark is clearly identified as the country 
where people are on average most satisfied with their lives with an average value 
of 3.6 on a scale that runs from 1 to 4. At the lower end of the distribution are 
Germany, Italy, and France with averages of at most 2.9. The order in which the </p>

<p>countries appear in the bar-chart is quite stable over time and across other 
surveys such as the World Values Survey or the European Social Survey. 
In addition, figure 1 illustrates the large cross-country variation in terms of 
government size across the twelve EU countries in the sample. More specifi-
cally, it becomes evident that there are two extreme types of government in the 
EU: Scandinavian welfare states and Anglo-Saxon governments with an 
average of about 57 and 42 percent of GDP, respectively. Luxembourg as a 
particularly small country represents an exception to this classification. Figure 
2 provides an overview with respect to the size and functional composition of 
public expenditures for the twelve countries. The time series plots on the left 
reveal that there is also some variation over time in the degree of government 
involvement. For Finland, Sweden and Ireland this variation amounts to up to 
10 percentage points in the time period considered here. 
The pie chart on the right of figure 2 disaggregates public expenditures 
according to the purposes on which they are spent and displays unweighted 
averages for the twelve countries across the relevant time period. Social 
protection expenditures represent the highest share of public spending 
(37.8%), followed by expenditures on general public services, health and 
education. Smaller categories with a share of less than 10% include economic 
affairs, public order and safety, and defense. The residual category sums up 
spending on recreation, culture and religion (2.2%), environmental protection 
(1.3%) and housing and community amenities (2.1%). Tables 6 to 9 in the 
appendix provide a more detailed overview of the data and its sources as well as 
definitions of the expenditure categories. In the estimations in section IV the 
focus is on education, health and social protection expenditures which on 
average sum up to more than 60% of the total budget. </p>

<p>THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING IN EUROPE </p>

<p>The set of controls at the country-level includes three macroeconomic 
variables that are taken from the OECD databases. First, all estimations 
include the log of GDP per capita owing to the long tradition of investigations 
regarding the effect of a nation's prosperity on well-being (Easterlin 1974; 
Oswald 1997). Second, unemployment rates are incorporated into the regres-
sion analysis given that Lucas et al. (2004) find a large and persistent effect of 
unemployment on life satisfaction. It appears that even people, who find a job 
after being unemployed for a while, do not return to their initial level of life 
satisfaction. In this context, one has to keep in mind that the unemployment 
rate also captures negative effects on well-being through social problems such 
as crime (Edmark 2005) 9 and social exclusion. The third macroeconomic 
variable to be found in all estimations is inflation as a result of Di Tella et al.'s 
(2001) evidence that high inflation depresses well-being in the United States and 
Europe, even if the effect is smaller than for unemployment. 
The political and institutional environment related to the efficient satisfac-
tion of voters' preferences is also likely to affect well-being as suggested by 
Hudson (2006) and Wagner et al. (2009). 10 The first variable of interest is 
corruption which is measured by means of the Corruption Perceptions Index 
(CPI) 11 and for which data is available on an annual basis. In order to facilitate 
the interpretation of the slope coefficients in the estimations this measure is 
rescaled as Corruption 5 10 -CPI score. The second institutional factor that is 
considered is the extent of decentralization measured as the share of sub-
national expenditures in total public expenditures. Data on expenditure 
decentralization is provided by the World Bank as part of the Fiscal 
Decentralization Indicators. </p>

<p>2. Empirical strategy </p>

<p>The regression model that is best suited to this analysis is an ordered response 
model, where the dependent variable -people's observable satisfaction with 
life -is discrete and defined on a finite ordinal scale, i. e. Lifesat itc A{ 1, 2, 3, 4 }. </p>

<p>9. Using a panel of Swedish counties ranging from 1988 to 1999, she finds that unemployment has a 
significantly positive effect on property crimes such as burglary, car and bike theft. 
10. Hudson (2006) provides evidence that institutional performance and the resulting level of trust in 
institutions has a direct impact on subjective well-being in EU countries, while Wagner et al. (2009) 
find that institutional quality measured by the rule of law, well-functioning regulation and low 
corruption has a positive effect on people's satisfaction with democracy. This may lead to higher 
subjective well-being in general. 
11. The CPI is a 'poll of polls' using information from up to 12 individual surveys. Country scores 
correlate strongly with other available indexes. For further details on its construction see Treisman 
(2007). Data reaching back to 1995 for a large number of countries are available at http:// 
www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi. </p>

<p>The first part of the ordered response model consists of a structural equation 
with respect to the latent, continuous dependent variable: </p>

<p>Lifesat Ã 
itc ¼ a þ bIndividual itc þ gExpenditures tc 
þ dMacro tc þ o t þ m c þ e itc ; 
ð1Þ </p>

<p>where the subscripts represent individuals, time periods and countries. Ex-
penditures tc represents both total government expenditures as a share of GDP 
as well as expenditure subcategories as a share of total expenditures, while e itc 
represents the error term which we assume to be i.i.d. and normally distributed. 
Therefore, we are estimating an ordered probit model. Individual itc includes a 
number of characteristics of the respondents such as gender, age, relative 
income, ideological preferences, marital status, education level, employment 
status and the number of children. 
On a country level Macro tc includes the log of GDP per capita, unemploy-
ment rates and inflation rates. 12 In addition, all regressions include time fixed 
effects o t in order to control for common exogenous shocks, an intercept a, and 
country fixed effects m c . Country fixed effects are included due to the available 
evidence that measures of subjective well-being are not internationally com-
parable (Diener and Oishi 2006). In some of the regressions nonlinear relation-
ships between government expenditures and life satisfaction are tested by 
means of interactions with institutional factors and a quadratic government 
expenditures term. These are not explicitly specified in equation (1) to save 
space. 
The second part of the ordered response model is an observation rule for the 
ordinal dependent variable, which relates the observable dependent variable to 
the latent variable. It simply spells out how Lifesat itc changes its value if

forward than for ordered probit estimations. </p>

<p>IV. EMPIRICAL RESULTS </p>

<p>1. Estimations </p>

<p>The empirical analysis is subdivided into three main parts: estimations for total 
public spending including nonlinear effects, regressions with regard to ex-
penditure subcategories and finally three robustness checks. The results for the 
first set of estimations are summarized in table 1, where the estimations differ in 
the sense that the nonlinear terms are added consecutively. To begin with, 
model 1a represents a baseline estimation without any nonlinear terms, while 
models 2a to 7a each take into account different combinations of interaction 
and quadratic terms. 14 Since there are some missing observations for the 
expenditure decentralization variable and since corruption data is only avail-
able as of 1995, models 3a to 7a rely on a lower number of observations than 
models 1a and 2a. 
We start the interpretation of table 1 by pointing out that the coefficients of 
the control variables are in most cases significant, while their signs are largely in 
line with our expectations. On an individual level people's gender, age, relative 
income, ideological preferences, marital status, education level, employment 
status and their number of children have a significant impact on subjective well-
being as pointed out in previous studies. In this respect models 1a to 7a provide 
a very coherent and robust picture. With regard to the variables at the country 
level, the log of GDP per capita and government expenditures have a positive 
linear impact on well-being. In addition, a higher unemployment or inflation 
rate has a significantly negative impact on well-being, while the former even 
goes beyond the effect of one's own employment status. Thus, unemployment 
reduces well-being even for employed people as they may perceive their own job 
to be at stake. 
Now let us turn to the interaction terms at the top of table 1. First of all, 
relative income does not have a significant effect on the relationship between 
public sector size and well-being since the coefficients for the relevant interac-
tion term are insignificant in models 2a, 5a, 6a and 7a. On the other hand, the 
coefficients for the interaction with ideological preferences are highly signifi-
cant and have the correct signs with respect to hypothesis 2. This suggests that </p>

and expenditure decentralization is significant at the 1% level. Hence, govern-
ment size has a more positive effect on well-being in countries that allow for a 
higher degree of local autonomy. Finally, the interaction term with regard to 
corruption has the expected negative sign and is significant at the 10% or 1% 
level, respectively. Model 7a additionally reveals a highly significant negative 
quadratic term for government expenditures. This suggests an inversely U-shaped 
relationship and diminishing returns to government size in terms of well-being. 
The statements made so far only refer to statistical significance, while we 
have not been able to say anything about the coefficients' economic signifi-
cance. This has to do with the fact that the magnitudes of the coefficients have 
no meaningful interpretation in microeconometric estimations. The usual 
procedure is to calculate marginal effects which for instance summarize how 
an increase in government expenditures affects a person's probability to be 
'very satisfied' with his or her life. However, for several reasons we abstain from 
making these calculations and resort to the coefficients of the OLS estimations 
in section IV.2. The first justification for this approach is that Ferrer-i-
Carbonell and Frijters (2004) provide overwhelming evidence that results 
barely differ between OLS and ordered probit estimations in the context of 
happiness research. After all, the main difference between these two estimators 
is that the former assumes a cardinal interpretation of life satisfaction data, 
while the latter is more conservative and only presumes an ordinal ranking. 
Secondly, the marginal effects that we are interested in refer to the interaction 
terms at the top of table 1. However, the calculation of marginal effects in the 
context of nonlinear estimations with interaction terms is much more difficult 
than assumed by many researchers. In this context, Ai and Norton (2003) have 
identified 72 articles published between 1980 and 1999 in the economics 
journals listed on JSTOR that use interaction terms in nonlinear models. 
However, none of them provides a correct interpretation of the interaction 
term's marginal effect. In fact, the reported results often diverge strongly from 
the true results. As Ai and Norton (2003) point out, these marginal effects are 
not calculated by standard statistical software packages such as <rs type="software">Stata</rs>. 15 
To conclude, hypothesis 3 stating that government size has a more positive 
impact on well-being with high expenditure decentralization and low corrup-
tion cannot be rejected. Moreover, the hypothesis that government size has a 
more positive effect on well-being for left-wing voters cannot be rejected (first </p>

<p>15. Ai and Norton have in the meantime made available the inteff module which does calculate these 
marginal effects for the binary case. For the ordered response case, no such module has become 
available yet (Norton et al. 2004). </p>

<p>part of hypothesis 2). Hypotheses 1a and 1b are both rejected in terms of 
statistical significance given that we neither find that well-being is unaffected by 
government size nor that government size has a negative effect on well-being. 
Statements on economic significance follow in section IV.2 in the context of 
OLS estimations. 
Table 2 provides an extension of the estimations in table 1 through the 
inclusion of three types of expenditures as a share of total public expenditures. 
This allows us to investigate the validity of hypothesis 4, which did not play a role 
in the previous estimations. The general structure of this new set of estimations is 
as follows: Models 8a to 11a analyze the linear effect of expenditure categories on 
well-being, while model 12a adds squared terms. In the linear specifications, 
education and social protection expenditures have a significantly positive 
impact, while health expenditures have a significantly negative effect. 
The positive influence of social protection expenditures contradicts previous 
findings by Veenhoven (2000) and Ouweneel (2002) and confirms those by Di 
Tella and MacCulloch (2005) and Radcliff (2001), while the negative impact of 
health expenditures stands in opposition to evidence by Kotakorpi and 
Laamanen (2010). Most likely, this surprising result can be attributed to the 
fact that the dataset does not include information on individual health status 
and therefore, there might be a spurious correlation at work: Societies with a low 
average health status require high levels of health expenditures. At the same time 
a low average health status implies low levels of subjective well-being. 
The estimation results for model 12a reveal that the effects of education and 
social protection expenditures on well-being exhibit an inverted U-shape. This 
expresses the diminishing benefit of higher expenditures on these two purposes. 
Based on the estimation results for models 8a, 9a, and 11a the hypothesis 
stating that respondents on average report higher well-being when a larger 
share of the budget is spent on education and health expenditures (hypothesis 
4) cannot be rejected. In section IV.2 we will additionally calculate the peaks for 
these curvilinear relationships in the context of OLS estimations and compare 
them to actual spending patterns in the twelve countries included in the sample. 
Finally, we cannot make a meaningful statement regarding the validity of 
hypothesis 4 for health expenditures given that the dataset does not include 
information on respondents' health status. </p>

potential shortcomings of the baseline estimations. First, we eliminate the

<p>average life satisfaction lead to an isolation in the top right corner in figure 1 
(see section III.1). Therefore, the first robustness check excludes observations 
for this particular country. The underlying question is whether previous 
estimation results are driven by the peculiarity of Denmark's public sector 
and its society. Table 3 reports estimation results for six models that already 
appeared in tables 1 and 2. To be more exact, models 2a to 4a and 7a from the 
table relating to total government expenditures and models 11a and 12a from 
the table on expenditure subcategories are re-estimated. Since Denmark is 
excluded from the sample, the maximum number of observations drops from 
153,268 to 132,945. 
Compared to the results in tables 1 and 2, the signs and levels of significance for 
the individual characteristics and the macroeconomic variables are in principle 
unaffected. There are, however, some small differences with regard to the 
interaction terms and expenditure subcategories. First, the interaction term 
between relative income and government expenditures is significant at the 5 or 
10% level. This implies in line with hypothesis 2 that for individuals with a higher 
position in the income distribution the effect of government size on well-being is 
lower. Second, the coefficient for the interaction term between corruption and 
government expenditures is insignificant in model 4b, while it continues to be 
significant in model 7b. Since the latter is the more complete model, it can still be 
argued that the results are in support of hypothesis 3 with regard to corruption. 
Third, the squared term for education expenditures is not significant in 
model 12b suggesting a positive linear impact of education expenditures on 
well-being. As an alternative robustness check, we have excluded all observa-
tions where the absolute value of the studentized residual is larger than 
1.5. These additional estimation results -to be found in Hessami (2010) -
corroborate the finding that the results in tables 1 and 2 are not driven by 
outlying observations. 
The reader may suspect that the effect of government size on well-being 
identified in tables 1 and 3 is due to a spurious correlation with economic 
openness given that people's subjective well-being is higher in more economic-
ally integrated countries owing to a specialization in the production process 
(Krugman and Obstfeld 2006) or the possibility to consume more diverse goods 
(Broda and Weinstein 2006). This might especially be relevant in the context of 
the European integration process, which accelerated at the end of the 1990s 
with the introduction of the Euro. In addition, several authors (Kimakova 
2009; Ram 2009; Rodrik 1998) have argued that more open countries may host 
larger governments. 16 In order to eliminate the potential spurious correlation, </p>

<p>16. Note that another group of authors finds no correlation between public expenditures and openness 
(Shelton 2007) or suspects that the observed positive correlations are driven by a third variable 
(Alesina and Wacziarg 1998). </p>

<p>robustness check II includes the sum of imports and exports as a share of GDP 
as a control variable. 
While in models 4c and 7c in table 4 the coefficient for economic openness 
is significantly positive in line with our expectations, only few changes 
emerge with regard to the coefficients of the other explanatory variables. 
First, in model 3c the coefficient for the log of GDP per capita is negative 
and significant at the 5% level. However, this is most likely due to multi-
collinearity given that the relatively high correlation between economic open-
ness and the log of GDP per capita (r 5 0.46) is significant at the 1% level. 
What is most important is that the coefficients for the variables of interest at the 
top of table 4 are unaffected and therefore, we can conclude that the estimation 
results in section IV.1 are not driven by a spurious correlation with economic 
openness. 
The final robustness check involves a re-estimation of the baseline models 
in tables 1 and 2 with the OLS estimator. 17 The rationale behind this robust-
ness check has been discussed in section IV.1: the interpretation of the 
coefficients is more straightforward and the results between linear and 
nonlinear estimations in most cases barely differ in the context of sub-
jective well-being. The main results from the baseline estimations are 
again confirmed and only few differences emerge: social protection expendi-
tures do not have a significant linear effect on well-being, while the inverted 
U-shape in model 7d for this expenditure category continues to be 
significant. Moreover, as in robustness check I the coefficient for the inter-
action term between government expenditures and corruption is only signifi-
cant in model 7d, while the coefficient for the interaction term between relative 
income and government expenditures is significant at the 1% level in models 2d 
and 7d. 
Since so far we have not been able to make any statements with regard to 
economic significance, this is done in the following. As an example, the 
coefficients for the unemployed dummy are at around -0.4 in all six models 
of table 5. This means that all else equal, an unemployed person experiences a 
life satisfaction that is on average 0.4 units lower than for someone who is 
employed. This makes up 10% of the overall scale from 1 to 4 and can be 
regarded as a quite sizable effect in line with previous findings (Lucas et al. 
2004). 
Given that all models in table 5 except for model 11d include either 
interaction terms or squared terms, the marginal effects at mean values are </p>

<p>17. Another robustness check that may seem plausible involves the inclusion of tax revenues. However, if 
government expenditures and tax revenues are included simultaneously in the estimations, the 
coefficient for government expenditures is not meaningful anymore. It would simply measure 
whether government expenditures that are financed with debt, privatization income or other non-tax 
revenues contribute to people's well-being. </p>

<p>THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING IN EUROPE </p>

<p>reported at the bottom of table 5. 18 These calculations demonstrate that the 
influence of government size on well-being fluctuates between 0.009 (model 2d) 
and 0.041 (model 7d). Hence, all else equal a government that is 10 percentage 
points larger leads to an increase in well-being by 0.09 to 0.41 units (For example, 
the UK and Italy have average government sizes of around 43% and 53% over 
the considered period, respectively). Moreover, an increase in corruption by one 
unit and an extension of expenditure decentralization by 10 percentage points 
leads to changes in well-being by -0.03 and 0.1 units, respectively. 
With regard to types of government expenditures in model 12d, it can be 
concluded that in a country that spends 5 percentage points more of its total 
budget on education people's well-being is on average 0.18 units higher (To give 
an example, in 1999 Germany and Denmark have spent 9% and 14% of the 
public budget on education, respectively). In addition, the optimum of the 
inversely U-shaped relationship between education expenditures and well-being 
occurs at 14.5%. Consequently, all countries included in the dataset spend too 
little on education compared to this benchmark. On the other hand, we find an 
insignificant marginal effect of social expenditures in model 12d, while the 
optimum for social protection expenditures occurs at 41.1%. The only countries 
that spend on average a higher share of the public budget on social protection in 
the considered time period are Finland (42.5%) and Germany (42.9%). 
Additional calculations of breakeven points imply that government size has 
a positive marginal effect on life satisfaction if the share of sub-national 
expenditures in total expenditures amounts to at least 18.7% (fulfilled for all 
countries except for Belgium, France and Luxembourg) and regardless of the 
extent of corruption. Decentralization has a positive influence on well-being if 
government expenditures amount to at least 43.6% of GDP, i.e. for all 
countries except Ireland, Luxembourg and the UK, while the marginal effect 
of corruption on well-being requires a government size of 40.4% to turn 
negative. This is fulfilled for all of the twelve countries except for Luxembourg. 
Finally, government size only has a negative impact on well-being with out-of-
sample values for ideological preferences and relative income suggesting that 
the effect of government expenditures on well-being is always positive regard-
less of these individual characteristics. 19 </p>

<p>18. If the original model is y 5 a1b 1 x1b 2 x1b 12 xz1e, the marginal effect of x on y is given by @y/@x 5 
b 1 1b 12 z. As a next step, we have evaluated this effect at the sample average 
z. Finally, the variance of 
the estimated marginal effect is given by Varð@y=@xÞ ¼ Varðb 1 Þ þ 
z 2 Varðb 12 Þ þ 2 zCovðb 1 ; b 12 Þ. 
The formula for the calculation of marginal effects in the presence of squared terms can be derived in 
a similar fashion. 
19. Another noteworthy insight from the calculations in table 5 is that at mean values of government size 
right-wing voters are more satisfied with their lives than left-wing voters by 0.04 to 0.08 units. 
Furthermore, if an individual advances to the next income quartile, his or her life satisfaction 
increases by 0.07 to 0.08 units. </p>

<p>A breakeven analysis for government expenditures in model 7d reveals 
that the peak of the inversely U-shaped relationship with well-being occurs 
at a government size of 76.5%. This means that given average values for 
relative income, ideological preferences and corruption, the marginal 
benefit and the marginal cost of a larger government just outweigh each other 
at this level as summarized in hypothesis 1a. There are, however, several 
reasons why the numerical value for the optimal government size should be 
interpreted with caution. First, the largest government size in our sample is 
recorded for Sweden in 1995 with 66.3%, while none of the countries in our 
sample has any experience with a government of more than 70% in the time 
period considered here. Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether such a large 
government would indeed contribute to people's well-being. Second, the value 
for the peak is quite sensitive to the exclusion of observations. If Finland or 
Ireland are dropped from the sample, the peak shifts down to 69.2% and 
70.0%, respectively. 
Third, by including the log of GDP per capita on the right-hand side 
of the regression equation and thereby holding income constant, the 
estimations do not capture to what extent high tax rates lead to economic 
distortions and lower income levels. Hence, there is an indirect channel 
for a negative effect of government size on life satisfaction which the single-
equation estimations do not take into account. Dropping the log of GDP per 
capita from the regression equation, however, is also unreasonable as this 
would cause an omitted variable bias with regard to the coefficient of 
government expenditures. Summarizing, it is likely that the estimation 
of a system of equations would suggest a lower value for the optimal 
government size. 
Fourth, one should generally be aware of the dynamic effects created by a 
larger government or more specifically a more generous welfare state. In this 
context, Heinemann (2008) provides evidence for deteriorating welfare state 
ethics in the presence of generous benefits which may lead to a self-destruction 
of the welfare state in the long run. Fifth, even though the estimation results 
suggest a further extension of government size, the magnitude of the effect on 
subjective well-being may be as low as 0.09 given an increase of government size 
by 10 percentage points (see model 11d). The main message to remember from 
the empirical analysis is that there is robust evidence for a curvilinear 
relationship indicating diminishing returns to government size in terms of 
well-being. 
When taking the results from tables 1 to 5 together, the following conclusions 
can be drawn: Hypotheses 1a and 1b are rejected, which is not surprising, as 
they represent very extreme views on the government. In reality, there 
are neither omniscient social planners who can determine the optimal govern-
ment size nor do politicians exclusively follow selfish interests given their </p>

<p>desire to be re-elected. What we can conclude is that enlargements of 
government size in the past have been in the best interest of citizens in the 
EU as one would expect in democratic societies. In addition, neither hypothesis 
2 nor hypothesis 3 can be rejected. Hence, the effect of public sector size on 
people's well-being is strongly affected by institutional quality (degrees of 
decentralization and corruption) and respondents' characteristics (position in 
the income distribution and ideological preferences). Finally, hypothesis 4 
cannot be rejected with respect to education expenditures, but with respect to 
social protection expenditures. This implies that the positive effect of govern-
ment size on well-being is larger in countries where a large share of the budget is 
spent on education. </p>

<p>V. CONCLUSION </p>

<p>The preceding sections have analyzed the impact of the size and composition of 
government expenditures on life satisfaction and have brought to light several 
interesting insights. The first finding is an inversely U-shaped relationship 
between government size and well-being. More detailed calculations reveal that 
enlargements of government size in the past have not occurred against the 
interests of citizens in the EU. Secondly, the quality of institutions (levels of 
corruption and expenditure decentralization) has on average a significantly 
positive impact on well-being given current sizes of governments in the EU. 
Thirdly, low-income earners and left-wing voters benefit the most from a larger 
government in terms of well-being. Finally, the governments of all twelve EU 
countries in the sample could have increased well-being in the period from 1990 
to 2000 by spending more on education. Finland and Germany could have 
further boosted subjective well-being by allocating a smaller share of the public 
funds to social protection. 
The analysis in this paper can be augmented in the future through a 
more detailed disaggregation of the public budget and the inclusion of data 
on respondents' health status. In addition, an extension of the empirical 
model towards a system of equations would capture additional channels for 
the effect of government size on well-being and thereby yield more accurate 
estimates. Finally, some restrictions regarding the policy implications of the 
above findings are in order. As pointed out by Frey and Stutzer (2000b), 
entrusting government officials with the task of maximizing people's well-being 
may give rise to manipulations and some degree of arbitrariness in the public 
decision-making process. Therefore, the results in this paper should be 
supplemented by investigations that rely on alternative well-being indicators. 
The combination of results thus obtained can then inform and guide policy-
makers. </p>

<p>THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING IN EUROPE </p>



<p>SUMMARY </p>

<p>This paper empirically analyzes whether large governments in Europe reflect efficient responses to a 
changing social and economic environment ('welfare economic view') as opposed to wasteful spending 
('public choice view'). To this end, the effect of government size on subjective well-being is estimated in a 
combined survey and country-level dataset covering 153,268 respondents from twelve EU countries over 
the 1990-2000 period. The first finding is an inversely U-shaped relationship between government size and 
well-being. In addition, the analysis suggests that given the high institutional quality as compared to other 
parts of the world there might be scope for a further enlargement of governments in the EU from a well-
being perspective. However, one must acknowledge that the effect on well-being may be quite small and 
that democratic societies in Europe have no experience with even larger governments. The investigation 
also reveals that the impact of government size on well-being depends negatively on levels of corruption 
and positively on the extent of decentralization. Moreover, left-wing voters and low-income earners are 
the main beneficiaries of a large public sector. Finally, in all twelve EU countries included in the sample 
higher levels of well-being could have been achieved by allocating a higher share of public resources to 
education, while Finland and Germany could have given an additional boost to well-being by cutting 
expenditures on social protection. </p>

<p>ABSTRACT. We test whether commonly used measures of agglomeration economies encourage new 
firm entry in both urban and rural markets. Using new firm location decisions in Iowa and North 
Carolina, we find that measured agglomeration economies increase the probability of new firm entry in 
both urban and rural areas. Firms are more likely to locate in markets with an existing cluster of firms 
in the same industry, with greater concentrations of upstream suppliers or downstream customers, 
and with a larger proportion of college-educated workers in the local labor supply. Firms are less 
likely to enter markets with no incumbent firms in the sector or where production is concentrated in 
relatively few sectors. The same factors encourage both stand-alone start-ups and establishments built 
by multiplant firms. Commuting decisions exhibit the same pattern as new firm entry with workers 
commuting from low to high agglomeration markets. Because agglomeration economies are important 
for rural firm entry also, policies encouraging new firm entry should focus on relatively few job centers 
rather than encouraging new firm entry in every small town. </p>

<p>Agglomeration economies are commonly cited as a reason for the growth of cities. </p>

<p>New firms are attracted by the possibility of lower production costs or enhanced revenue 
streams made possible by locating close to customers or other firms. However, studies 
differ as to the source of these positive externalities.

are related to availability of or proximity to production input factors and buyers. Being 
close to upstream input suppliers or downstream customers lowers transportation costs 
and may improve information flows between producers and consumers (Jofre-Monseny,

2 Duranton and Puga (2004) explain agglomeration economies using three mechanisms: sharing, 
matching, and learning. Firms can receive benefits from sharing facilities and infrastructures, input 
suppliers and a labor pool. Firms and workers, and buyers and sellers can have better matching in a larger 
market. New technologies and business practices can be developed and diffused faster in a larger market.

<p>concentrations of educated workers may hasten adaptation of new ideas and lower the 
costs of labor turnover (Shapiro, 2006; Moretti, 2004). Having a cluster of similar firms 
may hasten innovation and improve firm productivity because firms can learn from one 
another or because they can share a larger specialized labor pool (Porter, 2003). Having a 
highly diversified mixture of firms may improve cross-fertilization of ideas across different 
firms (Glaeser et al., 1992; Feldman and Audretch, 1999). Local monopoly allows firms 
to grow much larger which may enable them to exploit the rents from new innovation 
without risk that the returns will be lost to competitors (Marshall, 1920). 
Most previous studies of agglomeration have focused on growth occurring in cities. 
By definition, rural areas lack agglomeration and so they would seem to lack these pro-
ductive advantages that benefit firms in cities. Yet rural areas are diverse, and there 
is a continuum of sizes along which agglomeration economies may operate. We inves-
tigate whether the positive effect of concentrations of economic activity exist in places 
that are smaller than what we commonly identify as urban. Furthermore, we investigate 
whether local factors related to agglomeration economies might have different signs or 
magnitudes of impacts between urban and rural areas. 
3 For example, proximity to input 
suppliers might be more important in rural areas than in urban areas because of the costs 
of transporting raw materials relative to finished goods (Kilkenny, 1998). Rural firms may 
be less concerned with the availability of educated workers if they are more concentrated 
in less-skilled and less technology-oriented industries such as retail or personal services 
compared to urban firms (Renski and Wallace, 2012). 
We use a data set on the location decisions of new firms in Iowa and North Carolina 
to examine how local agglomeration economies influence firm start-ups, and whether ag-
glomeration economies have different effects on the location choices of rural and urban 
start-ups. If agglomeration generates productivity or cost advantages to firms in a local 
market, they should have the greatest influence on firms at the time of entry. Because a 
new venture can open anywhere in principle, firms will assess the value of local agglomer-
ation and other market factors as they decide where to locate. It is costly to relocate once 
the entry occurs, and so aggregate growth measures that are heavily weighted toward 
incumbent firms such as local employment or local output growth will reflect past levels 
of market factors that may no longer apply. 
Another advantage to our use of new firm entry as a measure of market response 
to agglomeration is that local market factors are pre-determined and outside the control 
of nascent firms. This reduces the problem of reverse causality between agglomeration 
measures and more commonly used measures of economic performance such as growth in 
the numbers of firms or workers. For example, there may be a positive correlation between 
the number of firms and the proportion of college-educated workers due to the mobility 
of educated workers rather than spillover productivity effects from a concentration of 
educated workers. However, the entry of one new firm will not alter the concentration 
of educated workers in the labor market, but a new firm will enter a market with more 
college-educated workers if the firm can benefit from the spillover productivity benefits. 
If educated workers do not have spillover effects, new firms would not react to the current 
distribution of educated workers. </p>

<p>3 Rural firms have different characteristics compared to urban firms. See Renski and Wallace (2012) 
for simple rural-urban comparison of new firms. Differences are found in terms of industries that new firms 
enter, employment growth within four years after their opening, types of their major clients and education 
level of owners. Also, see Renski (2008) for a rural-urban comparison of new firm entry, survival, and 
growth. See Yu, Orazem, and Jolly (2011) for rural-urban comparison of firm longevity.

their focus on new firm location decisions. </p>

<p>We investigate the effect of six measures of agglomeration on firm incentives to locate 
in an urban or rural market: the number of incumbent firms in the industry; the absence 
of any incumbent firms in the industry; the degree of industrial diversity; proximity to 
upstream firms; proximity to downstream firms; and the proportion of college-educated 
in the adult population. Our results indicate that the same agglomeration measures that 
have been associated with urban economic growth are important for rural firm entry as 
well. The pattern holds for both all firms and manufacturing firms, and for both stand-
alone ventures and multiplant firms looking to expand into new markets. The pattern 
holds for rural firm entry regardless of whether the area is adjacent to or distant from 
an urban area. Commuters are attracted to the same agglomeration factors that attract 
new firm start-ups. As a result, even in rural areas, production would be predicted to 
concentrate increasingly in relatively few locations with workers commuting from the 
surrounding communities that lack the ability to offer sufficient agglomeration economies. 
This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review the few studies us-
ing a rural-urban comparison to examine agglomeration economies, and discuss different 
theories in local agglomeration economies. In Sections 3 and 4, we explain our empirical 
strategy and define our agglomeration measures. In Sections 5 and 6, we provide esti-
mation results and conduct robustness checks of our results using an employment-based 
analysis. Lastly, we test the role of agglomeration economies in commuting and discuss 
the policy implications of our results. </p>

<p>2. LITERATURE REVIEW </p>

<p>While scholars generally agree on the existence of productive spillovers in cities, they 
disagree on which local attributes are critical to the existence of the externalities. We focus 
on six local attributes that have figured prominently in the literature: clusters of similar 
firms, the ability to exert monopoly power, industrial diversity, proximity to upstream and 
downstream firms, and concentrations of educated workers. 
Marshall (1920) argued that there is an advantage for firms in the same industry to 
locate near one another because workers and firms learn from each other and the learning 
helps them develop new ideas. 
5 Specialization in a given type of production allows firms 
to share in a pool of workers with similar skills and saves transportation cost of materials. 
In addition, new firms will enter as upstream suppliers of inputs for the cluster of firms 
in the industry. 
Marshall also argued that larger firms have advantages over a larger number of small 
firms because of returns to scale in innovation and because firms can better internalize 
the returns to their innovation. 
6 A single large firm might be most able to capitalize on </p>

<p>5 "When an industry has thus chosen a locality for itself, it is likely to stay there long: so great are 
the advantages which people following the same skilled trade get from near neighbourhood to one another. 
The mysteries of the trade become no mysteries; but are as it were in the air, and children learn many 
of them unconsciously. Good work is rightly appreciated, inventions and improvements in machinery, in 
processes and the general organization of the business have their merits promptly discussed: if one man 
starts a new idea, it is taken up by others and combined with suggestions of their own; and thus it becomes 
the source of further new ideas. And presently subsidiary trades grow up in the neighbourhood, supplying 
it with implements and materials, organizing its traffic, and in many ways conducing to the economy of 
its material." (Marshall, 1920, p. 271)  6 As an example of how larger firms have greater innovation capacity, Marshall states that "[in the 
pottery trade, a small manufacturer] cannot afford even to make experiments with new patterns and 
designs except in a very tentative way." (Marshall, 1920, p. 281) </p>

<p>their innovations, although that would presumably limit the spillovers to other firms. </p>

<p>7 </p>

<p>Schumpeter (1942) extended this line of reasoning and argued that firms have no incentive 
to enter perfectly competitive markets because they will not be able to exploit the full 
advantages of their innovations. </p>

<p>8 </p>

<p>Porter (1990) followed Marshall in arguing that clusters of similar specialized firms 
increases the productivity of all the firms through knowledge spillovers. However, he ex-
panded on Marshall to include other firms in the industry as well as upstream suppliers 
and downstream customers in the cluster. Interaction and information flows across firms 
within a cluster promote technological innovation. 
9 Helsley and Strange (2002) also sup-
port importance of various input suppliers. In contrast to Marshall (1920) and Schumpeter  (1942), Porter argued that competition helps technological innovation because competitive 
pressure makes firms adopt and develop new technology to survive. 
Jacobs (1969) believed that technology innovation came from industrial diversity 
rather than industrial specialization. She suggested that seemingly unrelated ideas can 
provide breakthroughs to achieve technological innovation. 
10 Following Jacobs, Lucas  (1988) also emphasized the role of interactions between people as the rationale for cities. 
However, Lucas emphasized that it was concentrations of skilled people that were particu-
larly important for the generation of a human capital externality. Productive interactions 
between educated people make each of them more productive than they would be in iso-
lation. These externalities counteract the natural tendency of cities to fly apart because 
concentrations of economic activity bid up the costs of land, labor, and other factors of 
production. 
The empirical research investigating the effects of agglomeration is mixed. The ear-
liest study to examine the relative strength of these hypotheses empirically was Glaeser  et al. (1992). They found that industrial diversity and local competition improve employ-
ment growth in cities. Rosenthal and Strange (2003) also found positive impacts of diver-
sity and local competition on new firm entry. In contrast to the employment-based analysis 
in Glaeser et al. (1992), Cingano and Schivardi (2004) found that firm-level productivity 
was improved by specialization, but not by diversity and local competition. 
11 Other stud-
ies have found that industrial clusters (specialization) foster more entrepreneurship and 
lead to higher employment growth (Porter, 2003; Delgado et al., 2010) and higher wages 
(Wheaton and Lewis, 2002). However, De Blasio and Addario (2005) did not find higher 
wages in clusters and Duranton (2011) found only modest sized cluster effects. Henderson,  Kuncoro, and Turner (1995) found that specialization is important for mature manufac-
turing industries while industrial diversity is important for high-tech manufacturing 
industries. </p>

<p>7 "[A multitude of comparatively small rival producers] could not afford to spend as much on improving 
methods of production and the machinery used in it, as a single large firm which knew that it was certain 
itself to reap the whole benefit of any advance it made." (Marshall, 1920, p.484). Arrow (1962) and Romer  (1986) also view competition as bad for innovation because innovators cannot be compensated for the 
spillovers from their innovations fully. 
8 "But perfectly free entry into a new field may make it impossible to enter it at all. The introduction 
of new methods of production and new commodities is hardly conceivable with perfect-and perfectly 
prompt-competition from the start." (Schumpeter, 1942, pp. 104-105)  9 "Once a cluster forms, the whole group of industries becomes mutually supporting. Benefits flow 
forward, backward, and horizontally. [ . . . ] Interconnections within the cluster, often unanticipated, lead 
to the perception of new ways of competing and entirely new opportunities." (Porter, 1990, p. 151)  10 "The greater the sheer numbers and varieties of divisions of labor already achieved in an economy, 
the greater the economy's inherent capacity for adding still more kinds of goods and services." (Jacobs,  1969, p. 57)  11 Their replication of the employment analysis was consistent with Glaeser et al. </p>

<p>In line with Lucas (1988), Rauch (1993), and Moretti (2004) found empirical evidence 
that a concentration of college graduates improves productivity of all firms in the market. 
The external productivity spillovers are larger when the concentration of educated work-
ers is largest in technologically similar firms, in firms that cite similar patents, and in 
firms that are upstream suppliers or downstream customers. Winters (2013) and Shapiro  (2006) also found that the probability of being employed and local employment growth 
were higher in areas with relatively large concentrations of skilled workers, respectively. 
Glaeser and Mar√© (2001) found that wages grow faster in cities, presumably due to faster 
human capital accumulation. As for upstream and downstream links, Jofre-Monseny et al. 
(2011), Ellison et al. (2010), and Glaeser and Kerr (2009) found evidence supporting the 
importance of upstream and downstream linkages. The estimated magnitude of agglomer-
ation effects on productivity varies widely across studies depending on the context (Melo,  Graham, and Noland, 2009). 
While the bulk of the research on agglomeration effects has focused on cities, there 
are a number of existing studies that highlight the importance of agglomeration in rural 
areas. Given that rural firms have different characteristics than urban firms (Renski,  2008; Yu et al., 2010; Renski and Wallace, 2012), they may react to local agglomeration 
factors differently or not at all. To our knowledge, Gabe (2003) is the only study to compare 
rural and urban agglomeration economies, although he only studied responses to local 
specialization rather than a menu of agglomeration measures. 
Rural places can experience agglomeration economies in two ways. Because the bene-
fits of agglomeration attenuate with distance (Rosenthal and Strange, 2003, 2008), remote 
rural communities would need to experience agglomeration due to sufficient intensity in 
a sector to affect local economic performance. Research has shown that rural industry 
clusters increase employment (Henry and Drabenstott, 1996) and local wages (Gibbs and  Bernat, 1997). Barkley, Henry, and Kim (1999) showed that larger firm clusters in an 
industry lead to faster employment growth for growing industries in non-metropolitan ar-
eas. Gabe (2005) found that greater specialization in a rural firm's own industry increased 
its capital investment, but the effect is relatively modest. </p>

<p>12   On the other hand, agglomeration economies can spill over to surrounding areas so 
that rural areas can access urban agglomeration benefits through commuting (Partridge,  Ali, and Olfert, 2010). For this reason, positive impacts of urban agglomeration are found 
in rural areas within a commuting distance of cities (Barkley et al., 1996; Partridge et al.,  2007, 2008). In principle, urban agglomeration can have positive or negative impacts on 
rural areas depending on commuting and migration flows, and the relocation of firms 
(Renkow and Hoover, 2000; Wu and Gopinath, 2008). For example, if urban residents 
move to adjacent rural towns and commute to urban areas, rural towns may experience 
spread: positive economic impacts from urban agglomeration. If instead of commuting, 
rural residents move to the urban center, agglomeration would result in backwash, causing 
rural communities to decline. 
Establishment location decisions may respond differently to local agglomeration if the 
plant is part of a multiplant firm rather than a stand-alone firm. For example, a multiplant 
firm may be less sensitive to local upstream suppliers or downstream customers if the 
plant is part of an integrated but geographically dispersed supply chain. Previous research 
has found that stand-alone start-ups are more sensitive to local agglomeration factors such 
as industrial diversity (Glaeser et al., 2010), sectoral firm clusters (Henderson, 2003), and </p>

<p>12 Naturally occurring clusters attract new firm entry presumably because of some underlying local 
competitive advantage. This is different than trying to create industry clusters as a result of sector-specific 
government policies. We agree with an anonymous referee that the empirical evidence on the success of 
government fostering of clusters is decidedly mixed (Feser, Renski, and Goldstein, 2008; Duranton, 2011). </p>

<p>the available supply of educated workers (Barkley and Keith, 1991). None of these studies 
compared the impact of agglomeration economies on stand-alone versus expansion start-
ups across rural and urban locations. </p>

<p>3. MODEL </p>

<p>We want to examine the possible effects of agglomeration on firm decisions on where 
to locate. To that end, we sketch an empirically tractable model in which an entrepreneur 
decides where to locate a new establishment, given information on the nature of the 
business and its anticipated profitability across all possible locations. To begin, assume 
that the firm has C possible markets in which to locate (c = 1, . . . , C). We assume these 
markets follow county boundaries. Each market has up to K sectors (k = 1, . . . , K). Note 
that the absence of a sector represents a potential entry opportunity for a monopolist. 
Price-taking firms maximize their profit in two stages. In the first stage, firm i in 
sector k computes its expected profit in each market c. Given those computations, the firm 
chooses the location with maximum profit ( </p>

<p> *  </p>

<p>ik ) in the second stage. 
13 Expected profit is 
given by: </p>



<p> *  </p>

<p>ik ‚â° Max c (mkc, z c , p k , w c , r c) . 
(1) </p>

<p>The vector of local agglomeration measures, m kc , affects expected profit in county c 
by altering anticipated production costs. The vector of control variables, z c , includes local 
demand shifters amenities, fiscal policy, and dummy variables for county characteristics 
and state. Local demand shifters and fiscal policy influence production quantity and firm 
profit. Amenities influence firm profit through local wages. The dummy variables reflect 
common unobservable effects for all firm entrants in a county group and the state in 
which county c is located. Firm profit () increases in the sector-specific market price, 
p k, which we assume is equal across areas, and decreases in local wages (w c ) and capital 
rents (r c ). 
We define the vector of local agglomeration measures (m kc ) to include measures 
based on the conceptual and empirical studies reviewed in the previous section: </p>

<p>m kc ‚â° [CLUkc, MON kc , CON c , UP kc , DOWN kc , EDU c] . 
(2) </p>

<p>The variables represent cluster specialization in the sector (CLU kc ); the absence of 
any firms in the sector which would provide a local monopoly opportunity (MON kc ); local 
industrial concentration (CON c ); local access to upstream suppliers (UP kc ) and down-
stream customers (DOWN kc ) of firms in the sector; and the local availability of college-
educated workers (EDU c ). 
The first attribute corresponds to Marshall's (1920) and Porter's (1990) emphasis that 
a concentration of firms specialized in a single industry improves productivity through 
shared knowledge and a shared pool of specialized labor. The second reflects the presump-
tion that a single firm can internalize the local knowledge and innovate at a lower cost 
than can a large number of small firms, points emphasized by Marshall (1920), Arrow </p>

<p>13 Our assumption of expected profit maximization may not be true. First, people may not compute 
expected profit correctly, and second, they may be maximizing expected utility, placing a big weight on the 
location at the expense of the profitability of the firm. However, the reduced form specification we use tests 
whether the theorized relationships between agglomeration and profit carry over to firm location choices. 
Our results are consistent with these well-established theories. </p>

<p>(1962), Romer (1986), and Schumpeter (1942). 
14 The third reflects Jacobs' (1969) empha-
sis on a diverse mix of firms in contrast to the preference for specialization emphasized 
by Marshall and Porter. The fourth and fifth reflect upstream and downstream clusters 
that are mentioned prominently in Marshall, Porter, and Ellison et al. (2010). The last is 
related to Lucas's (1988) emphasis on shared pools of high quality labor. 
We define the vector of control variables (z c ): </p>

<p>z c ‚â° I NC c , AMENITY c , T AX c , EXP c, URB c , R ADJ c , R BIG c , NC c , 
(3) </p>

<p>where INC c is median household income in county c which indexes local demand for 
goods and services, AMENITY c is an index of amenity values, T AX c is the total tax 
revenue per capita, and EXP c, is total general direct government expenditures per capita. 
These amenity and policy-related variables have been considered in empirical studies 
analyzing local economic growth (e.g., Wu and Gopinath, 2008). We also use a series of 
dummy variables to indicate county size and state. Using the Rural-Urban Continuum 
Codes (RUCC) from Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, URB c 
indicates the county is considered urban or metropolitan (RUCC = 0-3); R_ADJ c indicates 
the county is rural and adjacent to a metropolitan area (RUCC = 4, 6, 8); R_BIG c indicates 
the county is rural and has an urban population of 2,500 or more (RUCC = 4-7); and NC c 
indicates the county is located in North Carolina. R_ADJ c addresses the access of rural 
counties to urban agglomeration economies because agglomeration economies attenuate 
with distance (Rosenthal and Strange, 2003, 2008). 
We assume a spatial equilibrium where wages and capital costs are adjusted to 
agglomeration measures (m kc ) affecting firm productivity (Rosen, 1979; Roback, 1982). If 
markets are competitive, firms will expect to make zero economic profits in the long run 
in all areas. If the agglomeration level m kc changes over time, lower production costs and 
increase profits in sector k and county c, market kc will attract additional entry relative 
to other markets. Entering firms will bid up the input prices for labor and capital until 
expected profits from additional entry are reduced back to zero. That suggests that in the 
long run equilibrium, wages and rents will be represented as functions of m kc . As Shapiro  (2006) shows, both local wages and local rents respond to local amenities and access to 
productive externalities. 
We assume that the firm makes its decision based on the information available on 
market conditions in the year just prior to entry, so that expected profits are a function 
of agglomeration measures in year t ‚àí 1. The linear approximation to the reduced-form 
profit function of firm i in industry k, county c and year t is given by: </p>

<p>ikct ‚â° m kct‚àí1 ‚ê• m + z ct‚àí1 ‚ê• z + Œµ i + Œµ k + Œµ t + u ikct , 
(4) </p>

<p>where the error terms Œµ i and Œµ k reflect common unobserved elements that influence profit 
for firm i across all locations and industry k profits across all firms. The temporal shock, 
Œµ t , is a common shock to all firm entrants across all locations in year t. The last term u ikct 
is a random shock to profits for firm i in county c that is assumed to be uncorrelated with 
all other factors. </p>

<p>15 </p>

<p>14 Alternatively, the local monopoly variable may represent negative signal to new firms. In other 
words, no incumbent firms in the industry in the county may mean that the industry does not have 
advantage in the county. 
15 Our empirical approach has a possible identification issue from unobservable time-varying location-
specific factors. For example, local government incentives might encourage firms in the same industry to 
be concentrated in one location. In this case, our specialization variable would be biased. We test this issue 
using different years (2003-2004) of new firm entry. We find consistent estimation results, which suggests </p>

<p>C 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. </p>

<p>ARTZ, KIM, AND ORAZEM: DOES AGGLOMERATION MATTER EVERYWHERE? </p>



<p>Each new firm entrant in year t chooses one of the potential C areas to enter, based 
on anticipated profitability. We define the dichotomous variable E ikct = 1 if the firm opts 
to enter area c in year t and E ikct = 0 otherwise. E ikct = 1 if ikct ‚àí ikc t ‚â• 0 ‚àÄ c = c. From 
the specification for profit in equation (4), we have </p>

<p>E ikct = 1 if m kct‚àí1 ‚àí m kc t‚àí1 ‚ê• m + z ct‚àí1 ‚àí z c t‚àí1 ‚ê• z &gt; ikct ‚àÄ c = c, 
(5) </p>

<p>where ikct ‚â° u ikc t ‚àí u ikct . Note that the common firm-, sector-, and time-specific economic 
shocks Œµ i , Œµ k , and Œµ t are differenced away because they do not affect relative profitability 
across markets. That leaves the pure random error term, u ikct which we assume follows 
the type-1 extreme distribution. We estimate equation (5) using the conditional logit 
estimator. </p>

<p>16   4. DATA </p>

<p>In our application, firms are selecting from C = 199 possible county locations because 
Iowa has 99 counties and North Carolina has 100. Our sample is commercial establish-
ments that entered a county in Iowa and North Carolina over three years (2000-2002). 
We chose the sample years to align with the availability of Census data. We restrict the 
sample to firms with a clear profit motive, excluding nonprofit organizations, government 
agencies, and firms with a public service emphasis such as museums or historical sites. 
We also remove firms in agriculture and mining. These firms cannot move freely across 
locations as their entry decision is affected by site-specific land or resource availability. </p>

<p>17   Our sample has 191,191 establishments; 68 percent of them are urban start-ups. 
Establishment attributes such as location, industry and ownership are obtained from 
the National Establishment Time Series (NETS). 
18 The database provides information on 
the universe of all establishments that opened for business in Iowa and North Carolina 
in 2000-2002. The database also includes DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System) 
numbers of establishments and of their headquarters or parent companies. If an own 
DUNS number is the same as that of a headquarters or a parent company, the establish-
ment is considered a "stand-alone start-up." 
19 Otherwise, it is considered an "expansion 
start-up." Urban (rural) expansion start-ups are about 8 percent (6 percent) of urban 
(rural) start-ups in the sample period. We use three-digit and four-digit North American 
Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes used in 1997 Standard Use Table from the </p>

<p>Bureau of Economic Analysis to define industries. The total number of industries is K = 
112. 
Our agglomeration measures include four that are industry-location-specific (CLU kc , 
MON kc , UP kc , and DOWN kc ) and two that are location-specific (CON c and EDU c ). Cluster 
specialization (CLU kc ) is measured as the relative size of the proportion of establishments 
in industry k in county c to the proportion of establishments in industry k in Iowa and 
North Carolina: </p>

<p>CLU kc = 
Establishments in k, c 
All establishments in c 
/ 
Establishments in k in Iowa and North Carolina 
All establishments in Iowa and North Carolina 
. </p>

<p>The local monopoly index (MON kc ) takes a value of 1 if county c has no incumbent 
firm in industry k, and 0 otherwise. Access to upstream (UP kc ) or downstream (DOWN kc ) 
firms measures the relative availability of suppliers and customers in industry k in county 
c. These measures are constructed with data on purchases and sales by industry from the 
1997 Standard Use Table, Bureau of Economic Analysis. </p>

Industrial concentration (CON c ) is constructed using wage bill data obtained from the 
Quarterly Census of Employment, Bureau of Labor Statistics. The data set has 10 broad 
industry categories. Industrial concentration is measured by a Herfindahl-Hirschman In-
dex computed as the sum of squared wage bill shares of industries in a county. It ranges in 
values from 0 to 1, where values closer to one indicate greater industrial concentration. </p>

<p>21   The human capital concentration (EDU c ) is measured by the proportion of residents over 
age 25 with at least a two-year college degree in county c. The local demand shifter (I NC c ) 
is measured by median household income in county c. Our education and income measures 
were compiled from the 2000 Census. The amenity index, AMENITY c , was compiled by 
the the Economic Research Service at USDA (McGranahan, 1999). The total tax revenue 
per capita, TAX c , and total general direct government expenditures per capita, EXP c, are 
compiled from the 1997 Census of Governments. 
Summary statistics on key variables are reported in Table 1. Levels of agglomeration 
differ significantly between rural and urban counties. Rural counties are twice as likely 
to have a monopoly opportunity in a sector. Urban counties have much greater density of 
upstream suppliers and downstream customers. Rural counties are more concentrated in 
relatively few industries and have lower proportions of college-educated workers. </p>

<p>20 This is also known as a location quotient. 
21 Industrial concentration based on output shares would be the most appropriate. Due to data 
availability, we use wage bill shares instead of output shares. </p>

<p>5. RESULTS </p>

<p>Table 2 illustrates the relative importance of agglomeration versus amenities and 
fiscal policy on new firm location decisions. The estimation results for the new firm entry 
(Equation 5) are reported in column (4). All factors are highly significant, due at least in 
part to the huge sample size. The most immediate way to assess the relative importance 
of agglomeration measures is to show how the log likelihood changes as these variables 
are deleted from the full model in column (4) compared to other exclusion restrictions. 
When the amenities and fiscal policies are removed, the log likelihood decreases by 0.06 
percent (or 0.02 per measure) between columns (3) and (4), while the log likelihood falls by </p>

<p>2 percent (or 0.33 per measure) between columns (2) and (4) when the agglomeration mea-
sures are excluded. This suggests that the agglomeration measures are more important 
for new firm location decisions. 
Referring to column (4), new firms are more likely to enter markets with existing 
firm clusters in the same industry and with better access to upstream and downstream 
firms and to educated workers. The opportunity for local monopoly lowers the probability 
of firm entry, as does greater industrial concentration. Firms are also more likely to locate 
in counties with higher per capita incomes, with higher amenity index values, higher 
government expenditures and lower taxes per capita. </p>

<p>22 </p>

<p>Table 3 shows how the agglomeration effects vary by market. The first three columns 
show the estimates for all industries. Column (1) provides estimates based on Equation 
(5), replicating results for column (4) in Table 2. Column (2) allows the agglomeration 
effects to vary between rural and urban markets using interaction terms between urban 
counties (URB c ) and agglomeration measures. Column (3) further distinguishes the ag-
glomeration effects between remote rural counties and rural counties adjacent to urban 
counties (R_ADJ c ). The direction of the effects of the agglomeration measures is consistent 
across rural and urban counties, although the magnitudes differ (columns (2) and (3)). In 
columns (4)-(6), we replicate the analysis limiting the sample to manufacturing firms in 
order to compare our findings with other studies that focused on manufacturing. 
23 The 
results for manufacturing entrants are consistent with the overall sample. 
We gain additional insights by converting these estimates into elasticities. Table 4a 
shows more clearly the relative magnitudes of the effects across urban, rural adjacent, 
and remote rural counties. Even though there are significant differences in magnitudes 
of effects across urban and rural markets, the differences are rarely economically impor-
tant. Agglomeration measures matter in both markets and they matter similarly. This 
result is consistent with Gabe (2003) who finds that industry location quotients have 
positive effects on business openings in metropolitan, and both adjacent and nonadjacent 
nonmetropolitan counties in Maine. In fact, the only large difference is that rural firm 
entry is much more sensitive to the presence of upstream suppliers, and this is true for 
both adjacent and remote rural counties. 
Among the agglomeration measures, new firm entry is most responsive to access to 
upstream firms, particularly in rural markets. Proximity to downstream customers also 
has a significant but smaller positive influence on new firm entry and again the effect 
is larger in rural markets. Our finding that firms are attracted by close proximity to 
upstream suppliers and downstream customers was first suggested by Marshall (1920)  and is consistent with more recent conclusions regarding urban economic growth advanced 
by Helsley and Strange (2002), Glaeser and Kerr (2009), and Ellison et al. (2010) for urban 
markets. Skilled labor (EDU c ) has the second largest positive impact on firm entry overall, 
and is the most important factor for manufacturing firms, a result consistent with the 
models of Romer (1986) and Lucas (1988), and with empirical findings reported by Moretti  (2004). Consistent with Porter (1990), clusters of local firms in the same industry attract 
start-ups, while the chance for local monopoly power does not attract firms. Consistent 
with Jacobs (1969), firms are attracted by a more diverse mix of firms. However, the 
presence of a monopoly deters entry, suggesting that the benefits from captured rents from </p>

<p>22 Note that counties can raise government expenditures without raising commensurate taxes because 
of transfers from the federal and state levels. 
23 When we limit the sample to manufacturing firms, we exclude three counties from the choice set 
because they had no manufacturing entrants during the sample period, C = 196. </p>

<p>Notes: Elasticities based on conditional logit results reported in Table 5. The results reported in brackets for 
monopoly opportunity MON kc are proportional changes in the probability of firm entry going from the absence of 
a monopoly to the presence of a monopoly in the county-sector market. </p>

<p>innovation proposed by Marshall (1920), Arrow (1962), Romer (1986), and Schumpeter  (1942) are outweighed by other costs associated with monopoly. </p>

<p>24   Of the remaining factors, local income level is the most important for new firm 
location decisions. The elasticity for per capita government expenditures is more than 
twice the size of the elasticity with respect to per capita tax burden. While the </p>

<p>24 We might get different answers if we were focusing on technology or R&amp;D intensive sectors, but 
most firms in our study will not be producing new products, developing unique production processes, or 
creating intellectual property. </p>

<p>amenity index was statistically significant in Table 3, its elasticity is extremely small in 
Table 4a. </p>

<p>25   These conclusions carry over to manufacturing firms as well: agglomeration 
economies have similar effects on new firm entry in urban markets, their adjacent rural 
neighbors, and their more remote rural counties. One other somewhat large difference is 
that the presence of a monopoly opportunity in the sector reduces the probability of man-
ufacturing firm entry more in urban than in rural markets. Presumably, the lack of any 
incumbents in a sector has more information in larger markets because the presence of 
monopoly opportunities is less common than in smaller markets. It appears that monopoly 
opportunities are not attractive because they signal a lack of comparative advantage for 
the sector in that location. </p>

<p>26   One implication of our findings is that local agglomeration continually adds to the 
number of firms entering a market. Even though the elasticities are similar between 
urban and rural markets, the levels of agglomeration are quite different as seen in Table 
1. While agglomeration matters everywhere, it does not exist everywhere. An urban area 
whose agglomeration measures are 10 percent over or below the urban mean in a way 
to increase new firm entry probabilities in all the agglomeration measures except local 
monopoly (MON kc ) will have 20 percent higher new firm entry; while, the corresponding 
value in a rural area is 3 percent higher new firm entry. On the other hand, rural areas 
that have atypically higher levels of agglomeration do attract new firms; a rural county at 
one standard deviation above or below the rural mean in a way to increase new firm entry 
probabilities in all the agglomeration measures except local monopoly will experience 
26 percent more new firm entry. As a result, places with more concentrated activities 
will continually attract the greatest share of new firms while places that lack these 
agglomeration advantages will attract few new entrants. 
27 This growth pattern results in 
a persistent hierarchy of city size as described in Central Place Theory (CPT) (Christaller,  1933). 
Next, we test whether stand-alone start-ups are attracted by different agglomeration 
factors than expansion start-ups. These results are reported in Table 5. The first three 
columns show the estimates for expansion start-ups; the next three columns show the 
estimates for stand-alone start-ups. The estimated impacts of agglomeration measures 
on stand-alone start-ups and on expansion start-ups are consistent between urban and 
rural areas. The one exception is that industrial concentration (CON c ) does not appear to 
matter for expansion start-ups in rural areas, but does matter in urban areas. Table 4b 
reports the elasticities for each firm type. Measured agglomeration effects on new firm 
entry are similar for expansion and stand-alone start-ups in urban, rural adjacent, and 
remote rural counties. 
Our finding that agglomeration measures have similar impacts on firm entry in 
rural counties adjacent to or remote from a metropolitan area may seem surprising in </p>

<p>25 Recent studies by Rickman and Rickman (2011) and Rickman and Guettabi (2015) document a 
decline in the role of amenity attractiveness in explaining nonmetropolitan population and employment 
growth. 
26 The proportional change in new firm entry probability for local monopoly is calculated for 
each observation and averaged across all observations. For each observation, that is calculated as 
follows: </p>

<p>P(E ikc =1|MON kc =1)‚àíP(E ikc =1|MON kc =0) 
P(E ikc =1|MON kc =status quo) </p>

<p>where P(E ikc = 1|MON kc = 1) is a fitted probability that 
firm i in industry k chooses county c when there is no incumbent firm in that industry county. 
P(E ikc = 1|MON kc = status quo) is a fitted choice probability when local monopoly is the same as the 
status quo. 
27 It is important to note that we are not considering congestion effects, which provide a "check" on 
increasing levels of concentration. The costs of commuting and other urban diseconomies limit city size 
and therefore city growth (Henderson, 2012). </p>

<p>ARTZ, KIM, AND ORAZEM: DOES AGGLOMERATION MATTER EVERYWHERE? </p>



<p>that adjacency to urban areas has been found to be critical in the rural development 
literature. 
28 The explanation is that agglomeration matters everywhere, but agglomera-
tion is not present everywhere. Areas adjacent to metropolitan areas are more agglomer-
ated than more remote rural areas and that explains their growth advantage. Proximity 
to an urban center undoubtedly has advantages for growth (Partridge et al., 2008) which 
leads to the accumulation of agglomeration measures in adjacent counties that induce 
additional growth. </p>

<p>Local Agglomeration Measures and Urban and Rural Growth Using Aggregate Data </p>

<p>As a robustness check, we examine the impact of county-level agglomeration mea-
sures on employment growth. We measure our agglomeration factors in the year 2000 
and test how these factors affect local county-by-industry employment 10 years later, in 
2010. The unit of observation is the industry-county pair. We have 21,890 industry-county 
pairs across the two states. 
29 Due to many industry-county pairs having no positive local 
industry employment in either 2000 or 2010, our dependent variable is a dummy variable 
which has a value of 1 if employment in the industry-county pair increased between 2000 
and 2010, and 0 otherwise. We estimate a binary logit model with the same set of ex-
planatory variables as in our previous analysis 
30 . Hence, this is a net employment growth 
measure where employment growth can occur from both new and incumbent firms. 
We find that the agglomeration measures have similar signs and magnitudes of 
elasticities between urban and rural areas and regardless of the adjacency to urban 
areas, which is consistent with our previous analysis. As shown in column (2) of Table 
6, the estimated coefficients have the same signs in urban and rural markets. Only two 
of the coefficients differ significantly between urban and rural markets. The presence of 
sectoral clusters lower employment in both markets, with the larger effect in urban areas. 
Monopoly opportunity retains its negative effect on employment growth but the effect is 
now larger in rural areas. None of the coefficients differ between adjacent and remote 
rural counties. 
The elasticities by market type are reported to the right of the estimates in 
Table 6. The main differences between these results based on the aggregated data on net 
employment growth and our previous results based on firm entry are the much smaller 
elasticities and the switched signs on cluster specialization (CLU kc ). There may be a neg-
ative relationship between productivity and employment. As pointed out in Cingano and  Schivardi (2004), if the price elasticity of demand is inelastic in an industry, productivity 
improvements can reduce revenue and labor demand. However, the simple correlation 
between output per worker and aggregate hours employed from 1947-2013 is 0.98, using 
the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Major Sector Productivity Series for the nonfarm 
business sector, so the empirical basis for the argument is suspect. 
A more compelling argument for the smaller elasticities in Table 6 compared to 
Table 4a is that at the market level of aggregation, current employment is a primarily the </p>

<p>28 For extensive discussion on rural-urban interdependency for rural development, see Castle, Wu,  and Weber (2011), Olfert and Partridge (2010), Irwin et al. (2010), and Partridge et al. (2008). 
29 There are 22,288 potential industry-county pairs with 112 industries and 199 counties. We excluded 
two industries or 398 industry-county pairs because they did not have any new firm entrants in 2001 and 
so those sectors would not have been included in our previous analysis. 
30 When we use changes in employment numbers, we obtain similar results, except that the MON kc 
measure becomes large and positive. This result is definitional; any entry into a county that previously had 
no incumbent firms will increase employment in that sector. The negative effect of monopoly is suppressed 
because you cannot lower employment from zero. </p>

<p>ARTZ, KIM, AND ORAZEM: DOES AGGLOMERATION MATTER EVERYWHERE? </p>



<p>aggregation of past employment decisions made by firms that entered the market under 
past market conditions and agglomeration levels. Costs of relocation are prohibitive, and 
so firms may not be in their best location given current market conditions. Consequently, 
the link between agglomeration measures and the growth of incumbent firms must be 
weaker than the link between agglomeration factors and the location decisions of entering 
firms. 
More importantly, our conditional logit specification estimating equation (5) controls 
for the unobserved firm profit component, Œµ i , while the estimation using the county ag-
gregate net sectoral employment data does not. These unobserved firm fixed effects are 
likely to affect the pace of future firm investment, employment, and production decisions, 
so they will create unobserved location-specific profitability and productivity factors that 
are almost certainly correlated with the observed agglomeration measures. Hence, the 
coefficients and the elasticities in Table 6 are biased and will not yield reliable inferences 
regarding the role of agglomeration on county-sector growth. </p>

<p>Agglomeration Economies and Commuting Patterns </p>

<p>As a second robustness check, we examine the linkage between agglomeration 
economies and commuting patterns. In theory, agglomeration will raise location-specific 
productivity, some of which will be captured by workers in the form of higher wages. That 
will create an incentive for workers in low agglomeration locations to move to or commute 
to locations with greater agglomeration levels. Importantly, the cost of switching job lo-
cations within a two to three county radius is relatively low compared to the potential 
returns and so commuting decisions can respond more elastically to changing market 
conditions than can firms. 
There is evidence suggesting that commuting is sensitive to local job growth. Renkow  (2003) found that a substantial portion (one-third to one-half) of new jobs is taken by in-
commuters. Khan, Orazem, and Otto (2001) found that economic growth in one community 
positively interacts with growth in nearby communities, possibly through commuting. Be-
cause we show that agglomeration increases new firm entry, we can conjecture that com-
muting is sensitive to agglomeration economies as well. However, testing this hypothesis 
has been limited due to the difficulty in measuring magnitudes of local agglomeration 
economies. Recent commuting studies measured the spillover of urban agglomeration 
economies to rural towns using the distance between urban centers and rural towns (Par- tridge et al., 2010; Ali, Olfert, and Partridge, 2011), but this measure does not capture 
variations in agglomeration economies within rural or urban areas. 
To test the importance of these agglomeration economies on commuting patterns, we 
consider a commuting destination decision of workers. Suppose that a worker i living in 
a home county h (h = 1, . . . , H) chooses a county d for work (d = 1, . . . , D). D counties are 
located within commuting distance which we set arbitrarily at 100 miles from her home 
county. The choice set of potential counties of work varies with the location of each county 
of residence. </p>

<p>31   We assume a latent utility function of worker i living in a home county h and working 
in a county d below. As in our analysis of new firm entry, we assume a spatial equilibrium 
model where wages and rents are functions of local factors affecting firm productivity </p>

<p>31 In our commuting data, 94 percent of workers commuting within a state (Iowa or North Carolina) 
commute to a county within 100 miles from their home county. Both North Carolina and Iowa have 
metropolitan areas that cross state lines, making it difficult to distinguish agglomeration levels across 
counties with in the same metropolitan area. We do not allow commuting across states because of limited 
data availability. </p>

<p>The explanatory variables are lagged and predetermined at the time of the com-
muting destination decision. For notational convenience, we omit a subscript for time 
period. 
The first term in equation (6) is the ratio of the agglomeration economy at the des-
tination county relative to the county of residence. Based on equation (5), we create the 
agglomeration index for each industry-county pair by </p>

<p>, </p>

<p>where the coefficients are taken from Table 2. This index is the contribution of the six 
agglomeration economy measures to the probability of new-firm entry in county c, relative 
to the probability of entry across all counties. We take the average across all firms to obtain 
the unconditional county-level index of AE c . Note that the ratio will be greater than one 
when a county within 100 miles has a larger level of agglomeration than the home county. 
When h = d, meaning the worker lives and works in the home county, the ratio is 1. If 
agglomeration raises productivity, they should raise wages as well, and so a county d with 
a high level of agglomeration should attract more commuters from neighboring counties. 
Commuting distance from a home county h to a county d (DIST hd ) raises the cost of 
commuting, and so probability of commuting should decrease as distance increases. URB d 
indicates whether the commuting destination d is urban, and captures unobservable local 
factors other than our observed agglomeration measures that may influence commuting. 
FIRM d /FIRM h is the proportion of existing firms in county d relative to in county h. 
We add FIRM d /FIRM h to take out the effect of relative county size so that the relation-
ship between agglomeration measures and commuting patterns is not just a reflection 
of county size. The error term, Œµ h, represents home-county-specific unobservable impacts, 
and is differenced away in the conditional logit estimation because it does not affect the 
relative utilities across counties. We assume that u ihd is a random error not correlated 
with the explanatory variables. We estimate the utility function using the conditional 
logit estimation. 
32 This framework is similar to the population migration study of Davies,  Greenwood, and Li (2001). 
We obtain commuting patterns in Iowa and North Carolina from the 2006-2010 
American Community Survey County-to-County Worker Flow File, U.S. Census Bureau. 
Distances between the geographical centroids of two counties were compiled using the 
County-to-County Distance Matrix at the Center for Transportation Analysis, Oak Ridge 
National Laboratory. Rural-urban classification is the same as in the previous new-firm 
entry analysis. The number of existing firms is aggregated from the firm-level data in the 
NETS in year 2000. 
Results are reported in Table 7 with elasticities in brackets. Consistent with the anal-
ysis of new firm entry, there is a very strong positive relationship between our estimate of 
the effect of agglomeration measures on firm entry and the probability of in-commuting. 
Thus, the same agglomeration factors that encourage firm entry also atypically attract 
workers from other counties. The effect remains strong even when we control for the rela-
tive number of firms and the urban designation of the county. The literal interpretation is </p>

<p>that a 10 percent increase in the probability of new firm entry in a county attributable to 
growth in agglomeration results in a 2 percent increase in the probability of in-commuting 
from a county within a 100 mile radius. Meanwhile, distance has a strong negative effect 
on the probability of commuting, whether from a rural or urban county of residence. 
The adverse impact of distance on commuting is of like magnitude for urban and rural 
residences. However, the attraction of greater agglomeration in a neighboring county is 
three times larger (0.47 vs. 0.15) for rural county residents compared to urban county 
residents. As a result, a given incremental return in relative agglomeration will attract 
rural in-commuters from a greater distance than for urban in-commuters. </p>

<p>6. DISCUSSION: INTEGRATION BETWEEN SMALL AND LARGE RURAL TOWNS </p>

<p>We have shown that the same agglomeration measures that have been associated 
with urban economic growth are important for rural economic growth as well. The pattern 
holds for both stand-alone ventures and for multiplant firms looking to expand into new 
markets. The relative sizes of the elasticities of the agglomeration measures are consistent 
between urban and rural areas regardless of industry classification (all industries vs. 
manufacturing) and establishment ownership (stand-alone vs. expansion). These findings 
of similar agglomeration elasiticites across rural and urban markets are consistent with 
the recent results reported by Glaeser and Gottlieb (2008) across metropolitan regions 
and Kline and Moretti (2014) in the Tennessee Valley Authority. Commuters are attracted 
to the same agglomeration factors that attract new firm start-ups. 
Our results have two useful implications to theories in local agglomeration economies. 
First, our results can test several theories related to agglomeration economies for rural 
areas similar to Glaeser et al. (1992) did for urban areas. Our results imply that the most 
attractive areas for new firm entry are diverse economies with proximate upstream and 
downstream firms, an available educated workforce and a ready number of firms already 
in the sector. Our results support the various theories of local economic growth including 
Jacobs' (1969) importance of diversity, Porter's (1990) emphasis on clusters, Lucas's (1988) 
and Romer's (1986) endogenous growth based on concentrations of an educated workforce 
and Marshall's (1920) theory of proximate upstream and downstream firms. But we find 
no support for Marshall's and Schumpeter's (1942) view that monopoly opportunity invites 
entry in order to exploit first mover rents; in contrast, more competitive markets seem to 
induce firm entry. 
Second, our results provide a dynamic context for CPT initiated by Christaller (1933). 
One of the key components in CPT is a persistent urban hierarchy; larger cities have 
more industries because higher ordered industries require higher demand thresholds. As 
mentioned in Mulligan et al. (2012), CPT does not have a sufficient dynamic explanation 
of how urban hierarchy persists. Our finding that agglomeration attracts new firm entry 
relative to less agglomerated markets means that the most agglomerated will get the 
largest annual infusion of new firms. Consequently, agglomeration economies are a key 
reason that the urban hierarchy persists. 
Based on our findings, we expect that rural communities with higher agglomeration 
economies will serve as regional centers of economic activity with their surrounding 
communities providing labor and customers who commute in. Glaeser and Gottlieb (2008)  and Kline and Moretti (2014) argue that the finding of common agglomeration elasticities 
across areas cannot justify place-based government intervention. Our results also suggest 
that there is no additional advantage to agglomeration in urban areas relative to rural 
areas that have higher agglomeration endowments. However, rural communities that do 
not have a critical mass of firm clusters, upstream suppliers, downstream customers and 
educated labor will find it difficult to attract new start-ups. Policies aimed at encouraging </p>

<p>new firm entry in dispersed small towns that lack agglomeration externalities would be 
much more expensive and will likely fail (Barkley and Henry, 1997). In addition, recruiting 
new firms that do not exist in the rural town would require additional costs because no 
incumbent firms in the industry would be a signal that the industry has no advantages in 
the town. The more promising strategy is to target new firm recruitment to the relatively 
few rural markets that have managed to foster sufficient agglomeration economies that 
they can attract both firms and commuting workers. 
33 Coupled with policies to help lower 
the costs of commuting for rural workers in the more remote regions surrounding these 
towns, such as funding for childcare centers in rural areas, this strategy may also help 
reduce rural poverty (Partridge and Rickman, 2008). 
Our findings call into question the efficacy of rural development policies that aim to 
improve economic growth in all rural towns. A "greatest potential" type approach that 
targets rural towns with growth potential, as evidenced by the existence of agglomeration 
economies, and promotes them as local job centers would be economically promising. While 
that means many small rural towns will continue to experience population loss, overall, 
a more targeted policy may stabilize regional rural population. </p>

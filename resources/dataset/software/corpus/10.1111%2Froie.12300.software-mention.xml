<p>Equation (21) indicates that there exists an immiserizing growth effect if the elasticity of substitu-
tion (E) is smaller than or equal to 0.5. 12 
Because the other effects in Equations (22) to (24) are smaller than or equal to zero, hav-
ing immiserizing growth effects is the sufficient condition for missing complete specialization 
in a Nash equilibrium for any level of DCA (k). This is summarized in the following 
proposition. </p>

<p>Proposition 3 If the immiserizing growth effect exists (i.e., the elasticity of substitution is lower than 
0.5), complete specialization is not achieved for any level of comparative advantage. (See the proof in 
Appendix (A8).) 
Letting the sum of the four effects from Equations (22) to (24) be zero, we have a simple 
relationship between E and k, E5 k11 
ð 
Þ= 2k22 
ð 
Þ, which is plotted in Figure 4. The area below </p>

<p>the curve indicates nonspecialization parameter combinations of ðE; kÞ. For E&lt;0:5 a country 
will not fully specialize for any value of k. For the Cobb-Douglas case explored in this paper, 
where E51, k needs to be more than 3 for complete specialization. For E to 1 (perfect substi-
tutes), countries fully specialize for any k &gt; 1. Moreover, the graph shows that a country will 
not fully specialize if the immiserizing growth effect exists (i.e., the elasticity of substitution is 
lower than 0.5). </p>

<p>The main finding of this paper is that when the government can control labor distribution, strong com-
parative advantage is necessary for complete specialization to be achieved in a Nash equilibrium. This 
paper also investigates how immiserizing growth effects are related to incomplete specialization in a 
CES framework. From the stylized model, this paper shows that the existence of immiserizing growth 
effects is the sufficient condition for missing complete specialization. Finally, this paper introduces a 
two-stage game where governments choose labor distribution and then optimal tariffs. In this two-stage 
game, complete specialization is never achieved for any degree of comparative advantage. All of these 
results imply that it would be difficult for countries to agree on free trade without any help from inter-
national organizations. 
The alternative explanation for incomplete specialization might be a commodity-aggregation prob-
lem. While 1-or 2-digit Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) results in a smaller degree 
of complete specialization across countries, finer digit levels (such as 3 or 4 digits) show different pat-
terns. For example, both the United States and China have strong manufacturing export industries but 
the United States is more specialized in transportation equipment while China is more specialized in 
electronic equipment. Another explanation for the missing complete specialization could be from the 
Ricardo-Viner model, in which there are immobile factor endowments such as land and capital. In 
contrast to the classical Ricardian model where labor productivity is constant, the marginal return of 
labor decreases as the quantity of labor input increases in the Ricardo-Viner model. This diminishing 
marginal-return effect prevents countries from completely giving up their less competitive industries. 
Another remaining question is how the elasticity of substitution between export and import goods 
affects the Nash equilibrium of specialization. The main reason why countries avoid specialization is 
that they want to improve the terms of trade through strategic labor distribution policy. Therefore, it is 
expected that for lower elasticity of substitution values, complete specialization is difficult to achieve, 
as shown in Section 6. However, under perfect substitutes utility, i.e., Uðx; yÞ5x1y, it is apparent that 
the Nash equilibrium with complete specialization would be achieved for any degree of comparative 
advantage, because the prices are not affected by labor distribution in this case. </p>

<p>NOTE S </p>

<p>1 Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2015) also indicated that government's capital control in undercapitalized countries can </p>

<p>recover the optimal terms of trade and, therefore, improve welfare because firms in those countries do not internalize 
the negative effects of too high investment on the terms of trade. 
2 Bagwell and Staiger (2011) and Broda, Limao, and Weinstein (2008) suggested empirical evidence that countries use </p>

<p>optimal tariffs in order to manipulate the terms of trade. 
3 Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson (1977) and Eaton and Kortum (2002) used an identical Cobb-Douglas preference </p>

<p>in a Ricardian model with a continuum of goods. 
4 Many research papers have shown that the existence of protectionism such as tariffs, quota, and environmental regula-</p>

<p>tions is the state of Nash equilibrium because countries try to improve the terms of trade through protectionism. For 
Nash tariff wars, see Johnson (1950), Gorman (1958), Kennan and Riezman (1988), Gros (1987), Syropoulos (2002), 
Zissimos (2009), and Ogawa (2012). For Nash quota wars, see Rodriguez (1974) and Tower (1975). For strategic envi-
ronmental regulations, see Barrett (1994), Kennedy (1994), Burguet and Sempere (2003), and Bhattacharya and Pal 
(2010). 
5 The list of 13 industries is food, textiles, wood, paper, fuel, chemicals, plastic, minerals, metals, machinery, electrical </p>

<p>transport and manufacturing not elsewhere classified. The list of 21 countries is Australia, Belgium-Luxembourg, 
Czech Republic, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Nether-
lands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States. The measures of relative productivity 
are computed using relative producer prices from the Groningen Growth and Development Centre (GGDC) Productiv-
ity Level Database. See Inklaar and Timmer (2008) for details. 
6 Depending on the choice of a country for normalization rather than the United States, some relative productivities might </p>

<p>exceed 3. However, considering U.S. markets share the largest portion in the world economy, using the United States 
as the standard country would be most appropriate. 
7 Also see Bhagwati and Johnson (1960), Bhagwati (1968, 1969), and Bhagwati et al. (1984). </p>

<p>8 Once the representative agent's smooth preferences are revealed, comparative advantage can be interpreted as differen-</p>

<p>ces in relative autarky prices between the two countries. Because of Cobb-Douglas utility functions, the measure of 
comparative advantage based on relative autkary prices is identical to that based on relative productivity. 
9 See the proof in Appendix (A5). </p>

<p>10 The Metzler paradox can also explain why the two countries have a mutual destructive tariff war under complete </p>

<p>specialization. The relative domestic price of the foreign good under complete specialization is </p>

<p>q 11t A 
ð 
Þ </p>

<p>p 
5 
ð11t A Þð21t B Þ </p>

<p>21t A 
: 
(10) </p>

<p>10 (It can be derived from Equation (B3) in Appendix B.) From Equation (10), we know that an increase in t A increases </p>

<p>the relative domestic price of the imported good. This is the Metzler paradox, in which the imposition of a tariff on 
imports decreases the relative internal price of that good. Under the paradoxical price changes, an increase in tariff will 
necessarily increase real purchasing power for domestic consumers.

<p>12 The Ricardian model introduced in this paper has a combination of effects that include expansion and contraction, so it </p>

<p>is not obvious whether the condition oEX(a,a 0 )/oa &lt; 0 clearly represents the immiserizing growth effect. To clarify this 
issue, it is worth presenting a simple model of endowment economy. With the same CES utility functions as in Equa-
tion 18, country A's endowment for good (x, y) is

p 
a; 0

and country B's endowment is 0; 
ffiffi ffi 
k 
p 
a 0

. In this endow-
ment economy, there exists closed form solutions for the equilibrium allocations, and the condition for country A's 
welfare to decrease as a increases is that E &lt; 0.5 for any value of a 0 &gt; 0, a ! a 0 , and k &gt; 0, which is the same as the 
condition in Equation (21). </p>

<p>which is a unique solution for I 0

<p>A8 | Proof of Proposition 2 </p>

<p>From Equation (21), we know that the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of immise-
rizing growth effects is that E &gt; 0.5. From Equations (21) to (24), we know that I A increases as a 
decreases if a 5 a 0 5 1. This means that if country B is in the state of complete specialization (i.e., 
b 5 1), country A does not have an incentive to achieve complete specialization. The same logic is 
applied to country B. Therefore, they have mutual incentives to deviate from complete specialization. </p>

<p>From Equations (B2) and (B5), we can derive the best response tariff function t A (t B ;a,b), that 
maximizes country A's utility conditional on t B . In the same way, we can derive country B's best </p>

<p>, we have </p>

<p>country A's indirect utility function in terms of (a,b), which is denoted as I T 
A ða; bÞ. From I T 
A ða; bÞ, 
we can derive the best response function a(b) that maximizes I T 
A ða; bÞ given b. In the same way, 
country B's best response function b(a) can be derived. For example, where k 5 3, the two best 
response functions, a(b) and b(a), are shown in Figure B1, where the Nash equilibrium is (a*, 
b*) 5 (0.62,0.62). 
From a(b) and b(a), we can derive the Nash equilibrium specialization (a*,b*) which satisfies a 
(b*) 5 a* and b(a*) 5 b*. By the symmetric structure of the model, we always have a* 5 b. From the 
derivations of t A ðt B ; a; bÞ and t B ðt A ; a; bÞ, I apply a numerical analysis using <rs type="software">Matlab</rs>. The Matlab code 
can be downloaded in mwkang.site11.com/code/rie2016. </p>

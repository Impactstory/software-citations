<p>Abstract </p>

<p>This paper shows that a strong comparative advantage is 
necessary for free trade and specialization in a 2 3 2 
symmetric Ricardian model to be achieved in a Nash equi-
librium. Governments strategically control labor distribution 
across industries, and representative agents maximize Cobb-
Douglas utilities. A Nash equilibrium with complete special-
ization is achieved if and only if relative productivity 
exceeds a key value of 3, which is considered a very large 
number based on previous empirical studies. This paper also 
introduces a two-stage game where each government choo-
ses labor distribution first and then tariffs. In this two-stage 
game, complete specialization is never achieved for any 
relative productivity level. Finally, by generalizing the 
Cobb-Douglas model into constant elasticity of substitution 
(CES) preferences, I show that if immiserizing growth 
effects exist, complete specialization could not be achieved 
for any level of relative productivity. </p>

<p>1 | IN TRO DUCT IO N </p>

<p>The two most important questions in international trade are the normative question of "why should 
nations pursue free trade?" and the positive question of "do nations have incentives to pursue free 
trade?" The former question is well explained by David Ricardo, in that comparative advantage is the 
source of mutual benefits from world trade. This paper indicates that the answer to the second question 
also relies on comparative advantage; a strong comparative advantage is necessary for nations to strate-
gically pursue free trade in a Ricardian model. Defining the degree of comparative advantage as the 
relative productivity between more and less competitive industries in a symmetric Ricardian model 
with Cobb-Douglas preferences, this paper shows that a Nash equilibrium with complete specialization 
is achieved if and only if the measure exceeds a key value of 3, a very large number based on previous 
empirical studies. This paper also shows that complete specialization cannot be achieved if the govern-
ment implements import tariffs in addition to labor distribution policies, or if there exist immiserizing 
growth effects. 
A rational government wants to manipulate the terms of trade by protecting the less competitive 
sector and controlling the more competitive one. However, protectionism under strong comparative </p>

<p>advantage results in a decrease in the domestic production size and consequently a decrease in its wel-
fare. Therefore, a strong mutual comparative advantage should be present in order to achieve free trade. 
Otherwise, the government would use trade policies such as export subsidies or import tariffs. Costinot, 
Donaldson, Vogel, and Werning (2015) explored the relationship between comparative advantage and 
optimal trade taxes. Their optimal trade taxes aim to control the production size of more competitive 
sectors with comparative advantage to manipulate the terms of trade. 
1 The difference between Costinot </p>

<p>et al. (2015) and this paper is that the former considered import tariff and export subsidy as their strat-
egies with a passive foreign government whereas the latter considers governments' intervention in 
labor distribution in a Nash equilibrium. 
Even though this paper assumes that governments directly control the labor distribution across 
industries rather than using indirect tools such as trade taxes, both Costinot et al. (2015) and this paper 
are based on the same main logic that welfare can be improved by manipulating the terms of trade. </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>There are many examples of policies that effectively reallocate labor towards low productivity section. 
Governments use various types of assistance policies such as domestic subsidies, antidumping laws, 
and industry bailouts to help less competitive domestic industries. These polices potentially reallocate 
the labor distribution from high to low productive sectors. 
The main model of this paper uses a simplified framework of Ricardian models described in Dorn-
busch, Fischer, and Samuelson (1977) where Cobb-Douglas utility functions are used and the number 
of goods is two. In this paper, a representative agent in each country has a Cobb-Douglas utility func-
tion, which is considered to have a "medium" value of elasticity of substitution. 
3 The elasticity of sub-</p>

<p>stitution derived from the utility function is the main factor in determining the equilibrium prices, or 
equivalently, the terms of trade. To maximize the utility of the representative agent, each government 
strategically determines the quantities of labor in the two industries. </p>

<p>4 </p>

<p>A government's incentive for specialization primarily depends on how much the two countries 
have a mutual comparative advantage. To define a measure of comparative advantage, this paper intro-
duces a symmetric model in which one country's labor productivity of its more (less) competitive 
industry is equal to the other country's labor productivity in the more (less) competitive industry. With 
the help of the symmetric structure, the measure of comparative advantage is defined as the ratio of 
higher labor productivity to lower labor productivity, which is equal to the relative autarky price. The 
main results are that (1) the degree of specialization strictly increases in comparative advantage, and 
(2) only if comparative advantage exceeds or equals to the number 3 would a complete specialization 
be achieved in a Nash equilibrium. 
The value of relative productivity 3 is a very large number based on previous empirical evidence. 
Costinot, Donaldson, and Komunjer (2012) measured relative productivities across 21 countries and 13 
industries based on the year 1997. 
5 Normalizing all industries to the United States and in all countries </p>

<p>for the food industry, there is no single value of relative productivity among 260 values (20 countries 
3 13 industries) that is greater than 3 or less than 1/3. Among the 260 values, 253 of them are in the 
range of [0.5,2]. The maximum is 2.74, which is the relative productivity of the Korean chemicals 
industry relative to that of the United States. The minimum value is 0.49, which is the relative produc-
tivity of the Hungarian transport industry relative to that of the United States. Considering that 3 is an 
unrealistically large value of relative productivity, the main result in this paper may imply that it would 
be hard for countries to agree on free trade and complete specialization without any international 
organizations. </p>

<p>6 </p>

<p>The model in this paper is closely related to the theory of immiserizing growth developed by Bhag-
wati (1958), which indicates that export-biased growth might deteriorate the terms of trade sufficiently 
such as to decrease the welfare of the economy. 
7 In the context of the Ricardian model, export-biased </p>

<p>growth can be interpreted as the expansion of the more competitive industry without contraction of the </p>



<p>| </p>

<p>KANG </p>

<p>less competitive industry. However, the government's action on labor distribution not only has the 
expansion effect (i.e., immiserizing growth effect) but also the contraction effect. Therefore, this paper 
investigates how each effect, separately, affects the government's incentive to avoid complete 
specialization. 
It is well known that a lower elasticity of substitution increases the possibility of having immiseriz-
ing growth effects (see Bhagwati, Brecher, &amp; Hatta, 1983, 1984). Therefore, I extend the baseline 
model by including a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility function with a general elasticity-
of-substitution parameter. With the extended model, I show that if the elasticity of substitution is lower 
than 0.5, which is the condition for the existence of immiserizing growth effect, complete specializa-
tion could never be achieved for any value of relative productivity. Although this paper shows that 
there is no immiserizing growth effect with Cobb-Douglas utility functions, the other effects (including 
the direct effect and terms-of-trade effects from the contraction) prevents complete specialization if the 
relative productivity is smaller than 3. 
This paper also investigates how Nash equilibrium specialization is determined when governments 
are allowed to implement import tariffs. Specifically, I introduce a two-stage game where each govern-
ment first strategically chooses labor distribution and then optimal import tariffs. This paper shows that 
complete specialization can never be achieved in such a two-stage game. This result of missing com-
plete specialization is closely related to Kennan and Riezman (1988, 1990), where agents are endowed 
with goods. The two-stage game in this paper reproduces the results of Kennan and Riezman (1990), 
where the optimal tariffs are a function of the endowments. Kennan and Riezman (1990) show that a 
more equal (asymmetrical) distribution of endowments between the two sectors results in lower 
(higher) tariffs and thus higher (lower) utility in a Nash tariff war. In the two-stage game, "endow-
ments" are endogenously chosen by the government's strategic action on labor distribution. Govern-
ments know that if they choose more specialized labor distribution, which implies a more 
asymmetrical endowment distribution in Kennan and Riezman's (1990) model, it will end up with the 
Nash equilibrium with higher tariffs and thus lower utilities. To avoid this destructive tariff war under 
asymmetrical endowment distribution, governments would have incentives to avoid specialization of 
labor distribution in the two-stage game. The main results of this paper support this logic, as it shows 
that the degree of specialization under the two-stage game is strictly lower than that under the one-
stage game. 
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces the Ricardian model with Cobb-
Douglas utility. Section 3 derives the best response functions of the labor inputs. Section 4 discusses 
how the degree of comparative advantage affects the Nash equilibrium trade specialization. Section 5 
introduces a two-stage game where each government strategically chooses labor distribution first and 
then tariffs. Section 6 investigates how the theory of immiserizing growth is related to the main model 
of this paper. Section 7 concludes the paper. </p>

<p>There are two terms in country A's utility function in Equation (13). The first term EX(a,a

<p>sector. The exporting-sector contribution EX(a,a

0 . By the definition of the </p>

<p>immiserizing growth model, country A experiences the immiserizing growth effect if oEX(a,a 
0 )/oa &lt; 0, </p>

<p>which means that expansion of the exporting sector decreases welfare. With Cobb-Douglas utility 
function, we have oEX(a,a 
0 )/oa &gt; 0 (see Equation (14)), which implies that there is no immiserizing </p>

<p>growth effect. EX(a,a 
0 ) is also affected by a 
0 because the contraction of the import sector affects the rel-</p>

<p>ative price of the exporting good. As a 
0 increases, the relative price p/q decreases and thus, EX(a,a 
0 ) </p>

<p>decreases, i.e., oEX(a,a 
0 )/oa 
0 &lt; 0. oIM(a,a 
0 )/oa is equal to zero, where (a,a 
0 ) 5 (1,1), because of the </p>

<p>domestic production of the imported good where a 
0 5 1 is zero. Lastly, we have oIM(a,a 
0 )/oa 
0 &lt; 0, </p>

<p>because the lower production of imported goods negatively affects utility. 
Where (a,a

in Proposition 1, if k is smaller than 3, the sum is negative; the sum is zero if k 5 3; and the sum is pos-
itive if k &lt; 3. 
While there is no immiserizing growth effect with Cobb-Douglas utility functions, it would be inter-
esting to investigate the relationship between the immiserizing growth effect and strategic specialization 
under more general utility functions. As indicated in Bhagwati, Brecher, and Hatta (1983, 1984), the 
immiserizing growth effect can exist for low values of elasticity of substitution between export and 
import goods. Therefore, in this section, we generalize the utility function with CES parameters: </p>

<p>Equation (21) indicates that there exists an immiserizing growth effect if the elasticity of substitu-
tion (E) is smaller than or equal to 0.5. </p>

<p>Because the other effects in Equations (22) to (24) are smaller than or equal to zero, hav-
ing immiserizing growth effects is the sufficient condition for missing complete specialization 
in a Nash equilibrium for any level of DCA (k). This is summarized in the following 
proposition. </p>

<p>Proposition 3 If the immiserizing growth effect exists (i.e., the elasticity of substitution is lower than 
0.5), complete specialization is not achieved for any level of comparative advantage. (See the proof in 
Appendix (A8).) 
Letting the sum of the four effects from Equations (22) to (24) be zero, we have a simple 
relationship between E and k, E5 k11

the curve indicates nonspecialization parameter combinations of ðE; kÞ. For E&lt;0:5 a country 
will not fully specialize for any value of k. For the Cobb-Douglas case explored in this paper, 
where E51, k needs to be more than 3 for complete specialization. For E to 1 (perfect substi-
tutes), countries fully specialize for any k &gt; 1. Moreover, the graph shows that a country will 
not fully specialize if the immiserizing growth effect exists (i.e., the elasticity of substitution is 
lower than 0.5). </p>

<p>7 | CONC LUD IN G REM ARK S </p>

<p>The main finding of this paper is that when the government can control labor distribution, strong com-
parative advantage is necessary for complete specialization to be achieved in a Nash equilibrium. This 
paper also investigates how immiserizing growth effects are related to incomplete specialization in a 
CES framework. From the stylized model, this paper shows that the existence of immiserizing growth 
effects is the sufficient condition for missing complete specialization. Finally, this paper introduces a 
two-stage game where governments choose labor distribution and then optimal tariffs. In this two-stage 
game, complete specialization is never achieved for any degree of comparative advantage. All of these 
results imply that it would be difficult for countries to agree on free trade without any help from inter-
national organizations. 
The alternative explanation for incomplete specialization might be a commodity-aggregation prob-
lem. While 1-or 2-digit Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) results in a smaller degree 
of complete specialization across countries, finer digit levels (such as 3 or 4 digits) show different pat-
terns. For example, both the United States and China have strong manufacturing export industries but 
the United States is more specialized in transportation equipment while China is more specialized in 
electronic equipment. Another explanation for the missing complete specialization could be from the 
Ricardo-Viner model, in which there are immobile factor endowments such as land and capital. In 
contrast to the classical Ricardian model where labor productivity is constant, the marginal return of 
labor decreases as the quantity of labor input increases in the Ricardo-Viner model. This diminishing 
marginal-return effect prevents countries from completely giving up their less competitive industries. 
Another remaining question is how the elasticity of substitution between export and import goods 
affects the Nash equilibrium of specialization. The main reason why countries avoid specialization is 
that they want to improve the terms of trade through strategic labor distribution policy. Therefore, it is 
expected that for lower elasticity of substitution values, complete specialization is difficult to achieve, 
as shown in Section 6. However, under perfect substitutes utility, i.e., Uðx; yÞ5x1y, it is apparent that 
the Nash equilibrium with complete specialization would be achieved for any degree of comparative 
advantage, because the prices are not affected by labor distribution in this case. </p>

<p>1 Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2015) also indicated that government's capital control in undercapitalized countries can </p>

<p>recover the optimal terms of trade and, therefore, improve welfare because firms in those countries do not internalize 
the negative effects of too high investment on the terms of trade. 
2 Bagwell and Staiger (2011) and Broda, Limao, and Weinstein (2008) suggested empirical evidence that countries use </p>

<p>optimal tariffs in order to manipulate the terms of trade. 
3 Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson (1977) and Eaton and Kortum (2002) used an identical Cobb-Douglas preference </p>

<p>in a Ricardian model with a continuum of goods. 
4 Many research papers have shown that the existence of protectionism such as tariffs, quota, and environmental regula-</p>

<p>tions is the state of Nash equilibrium because countries try to improve the terms of trade through protectionism. For 
Nash tariff wars, see Johnson (1950), Gorman (1958), Kennan and Riezman (1988), Gros (1987), Syropoulos (2002), 
Zissimos (2009), and Ogawa (2012). For Nash quota wars, see Rodriguez (1974) and Tower (1975). For strategic envi-
ronmental regulations, see Barrett (1994), Kennedy (1994), Burguet and Sempere (2003), and Bhattacharya and Pal

are computed using relative producer prices from the Groningen Growth and Development Centre (GGDC) Productiv-
ity Level Database. See Inklaar and Timmer (2008) for details. 
6 Depending on the choice of a country for normalization rather than the United States, some relative productivities might </p>

<p>exceed 3. However, considering U.S. markets share the largest portion in the world economy, using the United States 
as the standard country would be most appropriate.

<p>8 Once the representative agent's smooth preferences are revealed, comparative advantage can be interpreted as differen-</p>

<p>ces in relative autarky prices between the two countries. Because of Cobb-Douglas utility functions, the measure of 
comparative advantage based on relative autkary prices is identical to that based on relative productivity.

<p>10 The Metzler paradox can also explain why the two countries have a mutual destructive tariff war under complete </p>

<p>specialization. The relative domestic price of the foreign good under complete specialization is </p>

<p>10 (It can be derived from Equation (B3) in Appendix B.) From Equation (10), we know that an increase in t A increases </p>

<p>the relative domestic price of the imported good. This is the Metzler paradox, in which the imposition of a tariff on 
imports decreases the relative internal price of that good. Under the paradoxical price changes, an increase in tariff will 
necessarily increase real purchasing power for domestic consumers.

<p>From Equation (21), we know that the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of immise-
rizing growth effects is that E &gt; 0.5. From Equations (21) to (24), we know that I A increases as a 
decreases if a 5 a 
0 5 1. This means that if country B is in the state of complete specialization (i.e., </p>

<p>b 5 1), country A does not have an incentive to achieve complete specialization. The same logic is 
applied to country B. Therefore, they have mutual incentives to deviate from complete specialization. </p>

<p>A ða; bÞ given b. In the same way, 
country B's best response function b(a) can be derived. For example, where k 5 3, the two best 
response functions, a(b) and b(a), are shown in Figure B1, where the Nash equilibrium is (a*, 
b*) 5 (0.62,0.62). 
From a(b) and b(a), we can derive the Nash equilibrium specialization (a*,b*) which satisfies a 
(b*) 5 a* and b(a*) 5 b*. By the symmetric structure of the model, we always have a* 5 b. From the

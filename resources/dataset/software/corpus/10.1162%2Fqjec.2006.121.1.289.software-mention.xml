<p>Artificial Life </p>

<p>Mark A. Bedau, Editor </p>

<p>Since its premiere in the fall of 1993, Artificial Life has become the 
unifying forum for the exchange of scientific information on the study of 
man-made systems that exhibit the behavioral characteristics of natural 
living systems. These systems can be synthesized in software, hardware, 
or wetware. Each issue features international research that spans the 
hierarchy of biological organization, including studies of the origin of 
life, self-assembly, growth and development, evolutionary and ecological 
dynamics, animal and robot behavior, social organization, and cultural 
evolution. 
The journal shapes and chronicles the development of artificial life, 
extending the horizons of empirical research in biology beyond the 
territory circumscribed by life-as-we-know-it and into the domain of 
life-as-it-could-be. 
Artificial Life is the official journal of the International Society for 
Artificial Life (ISAL). Subscriptions to AL include ISAL membership. </p>

<p>Neural Computation </p>

<p>Terrence Sejnowski, Editor-in-Chief </p>

<p>Neural Computation disseminates important, multidisciplinary research in 
theory, modeling, computation and statistics in neuroscience and in the 
design and construction of neurally-inspired information processing 
systems. This field attracts psychologists, physicists, computer scientists, 
neuroscientists, and artificial intelligence investigators working on the 
neural systems underlying perception, emotion, cognition and behavior, 
and artificial neural systems that have similar capabilities. Powerful 
new experimental technologies being developed by the BRAIN 
Initiative will produce large, complex data sets, and rigorous statistical 
analysis and theoretical insight will be essential for understanding what 
these data mean. Timely, short communications, full-length research 
articles, and reviews focus on advances in the field and cover all aspects 
of neural computation. </p>

<p>Journal of Design and Science </p>

<p>Joi Ito, Editor </p>

<p>The Journal of Design and Science (JoDS) captures the antidisciplinary ethos 
of the MIT Media Lab. Like the Lab, it opens new connections between 
science and design, encouraging discourse that breaks down the barriers 
between traditional academic disciplines. It explores not only the design 
of science, but also the science of design. 
With this innovative approach, JoDS intends to incite much-needed 
change in academic publishing by challenging traditional academic silos 
as well as the established publishing practices associated with them. 
The journal is hosted on an open-access, open-review, rapid 
publication platform called <rs id="software-0" type="software">PubPub</rs>, created by <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">students at the Media Lab</rs>. PubPub is a collaborative publication environment with rich 
commenting features, and powerful, intuitive authoring tools. JoDS 
articles are authored directly within the PubPub environment, which 
provides support for multimedia, image integration, and large data sets. 
Unlike journals that operate within a formal peer review system and 
rigid disciplinary framework, JoDS invites jargon-free communication 
across all fields of design and science, unconventional formats, and 
widespread community participation. JoDS empowers authors to engage 
in fruitful, ongoing discussion about their work with members of many 
different communities, both within and outside of their home disciplines. 
This rich, peer-to-peer approach to review provides for a much broader 
array of perspectives, new pathways forward, and emergent topics for 
further research. 
JoDS is shepherded by a team led by MIT Media Lab Director Joi Ito, 
and published in partnership with the MIT Press. All JoDS articles are 
published under a CC-BY 4.0 License. </p>

exciting sampling of works chosen by a guest curator and accompanied 
by notes from the composers and performers.

<p>The New England Quarterly </p>

<p>Jonathan M. Chu, Editor </p>

<p>Betsy Klimasmith and Leonard von Morzé, 
Associate Editors </p>

<p>For 90 years, The New England Quarterly (NEQ) has published the best 
that has been written on New England's cultural, literary, political, and 
social history. Contributions cover a range of time periods, from before 
European colonization to the present, and any subject germane to 
New England's history-for example, the region's literary and artistic 
productions, its political practice and philosophies, race relations, labor 
struggles, religious controversies, and the organization of family life. The 
journal also aims to demonstrate the importance of regional studies by 
encouraging work treating the migration of New England ideas, people, 
and institutions to other parts of the United States and the world. 
In addition to major essays, features include memoranda and edited 
documents, reconsiderations of traditional texts and interpretations, 
essay reviews, and book reviews. </p>

<p>Journal of Cold War Studies </p>

<p>Mark Kramer, Editor </p>

<p>The Journal of Cold War Studies features peer-reviewed articles based 
on archival research in the former Communist world and in Western 
countries. Articles in the journal draw on declassified materials and 
new memoirs to illuminate and raise questions about numerous 
historical and theoretical concerns: theories of decision-making, 
deterrence, bureaucratic politics, institutional formation, bargaining, 
diplomacy, foreign policy conduct, and international relations. Using 
the latest evidence, the authors subject these theories, and others, to 
rigorous empirical analysis. The journal also includes an extensive 
section of reviews of new books pertaining to the Cold War and 
international politics. 
The journal is published by the MIT Press for the Harvard Project on 
Cold War Studies. </p>

<p>The Asian Development Review (ADR) is the journal of the Asian

(ADBI). It publishes research on development issues relevant to the 
countries of the Asia and Pacific region, specifically ADB's member 
countries. The ADR publishes high-quality empirical papers, survey 
articles, historical analyses, and policy-oriented work. The ADR 
bridges theoretical work and rigorous empirical studies that advance 
the understanding of Asia's development; and it is open to discussions 
of alternative perspectives on all aspects of development, including 
globalization, inequality, structural transformation, and poverty. The 
ADR aims to disseminate the best research, with contributions from 
scholars in all fields, with the objective of providing the knowledge 
necessary for designing, implementing, and sustaining effective 
development policies. Its intended audience comprises a worldwide 
readership of economists and other social scientists. </p>

<p>ADR is an Open Access journal. The content is freely available 
to all online readers. A limited number of print copies of each issue

AEP selects articles from open submissions and solicits articles from 
the top experts in the fields that are of high contemporary interest.

economists from all over the world to each meeting to discuss the subjects 
of that particular meeting. AEP makes its publication decisions after 
reviewing the revised papers. </p>

<p>Publishing with The MIT Press' Journals Division </p>

<p>The Journals division of the MIT Press began in 1972 with 
two quarterly publications, Linguistic Inquiry and The Journal 
of Interdisciplinary History. Today, we publish more than 30 
titles in the arts and humanities, economics, international 
affairs, history, political science, and science and technology. 
The MIT Press was one of the first university presses to 
offer its journals electronically, and the division continues 
to adopt technologies that allow us to better support our 
scholarly mission to disseminate our content as widely as 
possible. The Press now supports multiple formats and 
delivers content to an array of devices while continuing 
to maintain a strong and thriving print presence for the 
majority of its titles. The division publishes journals owned 
by the MIT Press as well as journals sponsored by university 
departments, societies and associations. </p>

<p>The Press's services include online hosting, marketing, 
production, customer service, financial, subrights and 
permissions and much more. Our suite of traditional and 
digital publishing services can be customized to fit each 
journal's needs. </p>

<p>To inquire about publishing your journal with the MIT 
Press, please contact our Director of Journals and Open 
Access, Nick Lindsay, at nlindsay@mit.edu. </p>

<p>1 From 1968 until 2001, IDES provided a physical bulletin board that allowed employers to post open-
ings and job applicants to post their availability. Each side of the market would hunt through postings 
by the other side. Much of the coordination between employers with open positions and job appli-
cants occurred on-site, and interviews were arranged for the same or next day. In 2001, IDES began 
a computerized job listing and encouraged candidates to contact employers to schedule interviews 
in advance. Today, virtually all ballroom interviews are organized in advance of the ASSA meetings

<p>3 For a theoretical exploration of the gains from signaling in a job matching context, useful starting 
points are Coles, Kushnir, and Niederle (2009), Stack (2007), Avery and Levin (forthcoming), and 
Haque (2009). 
4 When candidates fall through the cracks, the result is an unstable matching because after the fact the 
candidate and a potential employer would both prefer to be matched with each other than with their 
eventual partner (for background, see Gale and Shapley, 1962; Roth and Sotomayor, 1990). Note that 
the relevant matching models for interviews are many-to-many matching because both employers and 
candidates can participate in multiple interviews. </p>

<p>5 These rankings are based on economics research productivity of institutions as weighted by journal 
quality: 〈http://www.econphd.net〉 (now available on the Internet archive at 〈http://web.archive. 
org/web/20071217125412/www.econphd.net/rank/nrallec.htm〉). We used econphd.net's "network 
rankings." Strengths of the econphd.net rankings include that 1) they are deep, covering nearly 
500 employers, and 2) they include nonacademic employers. A weakness of the rankings is that they 
rank institutions, not economics departments. For any analysis we do that involves rankings, we 
consider only signals to economics departments in ranked institutions and to nonacademic employers 
who are ranked. We do not examine signals to noneconomics departments in ranked institutions 
because we think that the rankings are less accurate for such departments than for either economics 
departments or nonacademic employers. Specifi cally, Figure 1 includes signals to economics depart-
ments and to nonacademic employers, while Table 2 looks at the subset of signals sent to economics 
departments only (including departments outside of the United States). </p>

<p>8 We investigated the possibility of nonresponse bias by comparing the characteristics of those who 
responded to our survey about job market outcomes to those of all signalers. These characteristics 
include indicator variables for current graduate student, economics as primary fi eld, degree from 
a U.S. institution, tier of degree-granting institution (as defi ned in Table 2), and tier of employers 
signaled. Ratios for these variables in the survey sample and population were virtually identical.

applicant quality. We also ran each regression using the employer as the panel variable and using a 
two-way clustered standard errors ordinary least squares model, fi nding similar results. Using appli-
cant fi xed effects instead of random effects, and logit specifi cations rather than ordinary least squares, 
again produces similar results. </p>

<p>Notes: The data are from surveys conducted in 2007 and 2008. This table summarizes coeffi cients in 
a random-effects ordinary least squares linear probability model in which the unit of observation is a 
single application from a candidate to an employer. The dependent variable is an indicator variable for 
whether the candidate received an interview from the employer to which the application was sent. The 
regressor of interest is an indicator variable that equals one if the candidate signaled that employer 
and zero if the candidate would have signaled the employer if either the candidate had been allowed 
a third signal (if they sent two) or the candidate had sent any signals (if they sent none). In columns 
B-J, we include additional indicator variables for characteristics of the candidate or the employer, 
along with the interaction of these variables with the indicator variable for whether the candidate sent 
a signal. We use the candidate as the panel variable to address unobserved candidate quality (with 
the exception of the regression in column B, which measures the impact of a candidate-specifi c trait: 
being a graduate student). Robust standard errors are in parentheses.

less effort along other dimensions to convey their personal interest in certain

<p>Occasionally prospective employers of new Ph.D. economists exhaust their 
candidates before hiring someone during the winter/spring " job market" 
period. Similarly, new economics Ph.D.s seeking a job sometimes fi nd that 
all of the prospective employers interested in them have hired someone else 
before they have secured an appointment. </p>

<p>Peter Coles, John Cawley, Phillip Levine, Muriel Niederle, Alvin Roth, and John Siegfried 201 </p>

<p>To address these problems, the AEA will establish a "Job Market Scramble" 
website to facilitate communication between employers and job seekers in 
late spring. Between March 15 and March 20, 2006, employers that continue 
to have an available position advertised in Job Openings for Economists ( JOE) 
prior to January 1, 2006 may post a short notice of its availability (with a link 
to the JOE listing). Similarly, new or recent economics Ph.D. job seekers still 
looking for a position may post a short announcement of their continued 
availability at that time, with a link to their application materials (cv, papers, 
references). The website will open for viewing at noon on Wednesday, March 
21, 2006 Eastern time. </p>

candidates; if new listings could be posted, candidates might be tempted to log on to the site frequently 
in search of new jobs. To avoid this, the only information that will ever be contained on the webpage 
is that which is on it the fi rst minute it goes online." See 〈http://www.aeaweb.org/joe/scramble/guide.

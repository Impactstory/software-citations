<p><rs id="software-1" type="software">R program</rs><rs corresp="#software-1" type="url">http://www.r-project.org</rs>To address the debate on the safety of generic substitution quantitatively, the author 
compared the change in AUC in virtual patients who were simulated for several dif-
ferent scenarios of generic substitution. In four scenarios of original (branded) to 
generic and generic to generic substitution, 5,000 virtual patients were simulated per 
scenario using the programming software R. The mean population AUC of gener-
ics ranged from 90-110% (scenarios A and B) and 80-123.5% (scenarios C and D) 
of the AUC of the original. Those patients who had an AUC change (ratio) as a result 
of drug substitution of less than 0.67 or greater than 1.5 were considered to be in 
potential danger due to the substitution. We found that less than 6% of patients fell 
outside of the cutoff range of 0.67-1.5 as a result of original to generic substitution. 
However, in the case of generic to generic substitution, the proportion was as high 
as 9-12%. This alerts us to the potential danger of generic substitution, especially 
for drugs with narrow therapeutic indices. </p>

<p>were defined throughout the simulation. In the equation (2-1) 
and (2-2), Pop Mean AUCGen1 and Pop Mean AUCGen2 denote 
mean population AUCs of two different generics (Gen1 and 
Gen2). Gen1 and Gen2 are those which are randomly select-
ed from many different generics of Drug X, produced by differ-
ent companies in each simulation scenario. In equations (1), 
(2-1) and (2-2), the individual mean AUCs in the i th simu-
lated patient (Indiv Mean AUCOri_i, Indiv Mean AUCGen1_i 
and Indiv Mean AUCGen2_i) share the same η i (BSV), which 
follows a Gaussian distribution of mean 0 and variance 0.04 
as mentioned above. Therefore, whatever value the η i may 
be, it does not influence the AUC ratios of switched formu-
lations in an individual patient. 
Equations (3) and (4) were used to produce the AUC for the 
i th simulated patient after taking the original (AUCOri_ij) and 
generic (AUCGen_i) formulations of Drug X. </p>

<p>AUCOri_ij=Indiv Mean AUCOri_i×(1+ε Ori_ij), ε Ori_ij~N (0, 0.1

AUCGen1_i=Indiv Mean AUCGen1_i×(1+ε Gen1_i), ε Gen1_i~N (0,

AUCGen2_i=Indiv Mean AUCGen2_i×(1+ε Gen2_i), ε Gen2_i~N (0, 
ω Gen2 
2 ) (4-2) </p>

<p>Because the simulated patient was assumed to take the orig-
inal formulation on two separate occasions, the subscript j in 
equation (3) corresponds to 1 (first time) or 2 (second time). 
The RV was described using the symbol ε . The ε Ori_ij was as-
sumed to follow Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and vari-
ance 0.1 2 (coefficient of variance 10%). In contrast to the orig-
inal, Gen1 and Gen2, the two different formulations of gener-
ics (i.e., manufactured by two different companies) were also 
assumed to be given to the same virtual patient. The AUC-
Gen symbols in the above equations were not given the sub-
script j because they were separately expressed in two differ-
ent equations, (4-1) and (4-2) by ε Gen1_i and ε Gen2_i. The ε Gen1_i 
and ε Gen2_i had different variance (ω Gen1 
2 and ω Gen2 
2 , respective-
ly) defined by each scenario. The time intervals between the 
four events of drug administrations (twice for the original and 
twice for the generics) per patient were assumed to be long 
enough to ignore drug accumulation. No period or sequence 
effect was assumed to exist. </p>

<p>Scenarios </p>

<p>The aim of the simulation was to compare the AUC changes 
in each patient when he/she was given the original or one of 
many generics. For all of the four scenarios (A, B, C, and D), 
the Pop Mean AUC of the original formulation of Drug X 
was fixed at 100. In scenarios A and B, the Pop Mean AUCs 
of the generics were 90, 95, 105, and 110, with the RV either 
being fixed at the same value (10%, scenario A) or being ran-
domly chosen from 1.0, 1.25 or 1.5 times (scenario B) that 
of the original. More often than not, there may be several tens 
of generics per original brand in the market. To reflect this, 
scenario C had 30 generics, with Pop Mean AUC ranging 
from 80 to 123.5, increasing by a factor of 1.5 but the RVs 
fixed at 10%. Scenario D had Pop Mean AUCs identical to 
those of scenario C, but the RV was randomly chosen between 
10%, 12.5% and 15% (1.0, 1.25 or 1.5 times that of the orig-
inal), as in scenario B. The use of larger RV values for the ge-
nerics compared with that of the original (10%) in scenarios 
B and D arose from the concern that the quality control ser-
vices of small-to-medium sized companies producing gener-
ics may not be as competent as those practiced in the com-
panies producing the originals. However, the Pop Mean AUC 
ranges (80-123.5) in scenarios C and D were assumed to sat-
isfy the 90% confidence interval of BE guidances (80-125). 
The four scenarios are summarized in Table 1. </p>

<p>Data generation </p>

<p>The models and scenarios were simulated using the R pro-
gram (Version 2.4.1, http://www.r-project.org/). For each virtu-
al patient, two AUCs were simulated after giving the original 
on two separate occasions (AUCOri_i1 and AUCOri_i2), and the 
next two AUCs after giving two different generics (AUCGen1_i 
and AUCGen2_i) which were randomly selected from the gener-
ics of each scenario (e.g., selecting two different generics out 
of 30 generics for scenario C). In other words, four AUC values 
were generated per patient, who shared the same η i, but had 
four different values of ε . The εwhich includes intra-subject 
variability, intra-formulation variability and other unknown 
errors is changeable at every occasion. This process was repeat-
ed 5,000 times per scenario to mimic the situation of pre-
scription and dispensing for the equivalent number of patients. </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>Scenarios A to D were sequentially run using the R pro-
gram. Each run of the scenario constructed data for 5,000 vir-
tual patients and four AUCs (two for the original, two for dif-
ferent generics) were simulated per patient. </p>

<p>AUC ratio of 'Original to Original' </p>

<p>Before assessing the effect of drug switch, the ratio of two 
original AUCs was calculated for each patient. This was to 
estimate the fluctuation of the AUC when the same formu-
lation was given to the same patient without any drug switch-
in other words, it is a measure of the influence of RV only on 
the AUC of each patient. In the top panel of Fig. 1, illustrating 
the results of scenario D, the AUC ratio histogram of 'origi-
nal to original' (AUCOri_i2/AUCOri_i1, i=1-5,000th patient) is 
given. The histograms in the other scenarios were almost iden-
tical because the model for the original formulation was the 
same. As shown in the histogram, there were a lot of patients 
who fell outside of the ratio 0.8-1.25, the equivalence win-
dow, in the course of repeated dosing of the original formu-
lation (4.9% of patients were &lt;0.80, 6.2% of patients were 
&gt;1.25). However, the number of patients who had ratios small-
er than 0.67 or greater than 1.5 was negligible. When the 
same simulation was performed with RV values greater than 
10%, the proportion of patients outside of the BE window 
increased accordingly (data not shown). However, the AUCOri_i2/ 
AUCOri_i1 histogram needs careful interpretation because it 
indicates the degree of fluctuation of the AUC after each dos-
ing, and not the ultimate increase or decrease in the mean 
steady state AUC, which stays constant since the patients 
were given the same original formulation. </p>

<p>AUC ratios of 'Original to Generic' </p>

<p>The AUC ratios (AUCGen1_i/AUCOri_i1) resulting from a switch 
from the original formulation to a generic in the four scenar-
ios are summarized in Table 2. The two different generics </p>

Each histogram represents the AUC ratios of 5,000 virtual patients. 
The generics in scenario D had a Pop Mean AUC ranging from 
80-123.5 (original: 100) and an RV of 10-15% (original: 10%). The 
proportion of patients falling outside of the ratio margin 0.67-1.5 
(shaded zone) was also included. (A) The AUCs fluctuate even

by more than 1.5 times after switch) was used to estimate the 
proportion of patients who may be harmed by the lack of effect 
or by overdosing. Along with scenarios A to D, the propor-
tion of those outside of the safety range increased from 1.3% 
to 4.6%. </p>

<p>AUC ratios of 'Generic to another Generic' </p>

<p>When a patient taking a generic is switched to another 
generic on the market, what happens to his/her AUC ? To 
answer to this question, we also simulated the situation of 
generic to generic switch in each scenario. The proportion of 
patients who had simulated AUC ratios (AUCGen1_i/AUCGen2_i) 
outside of the safety range 0.67-1.5 after 'generic to another 
generic' switch (2.5-12% in different scenarios) were always 
greater than the above 'original to generic' situation. In sce-
narios C and D, where the Mean Pop AUC ranges were greater 
than those for scenarios A and B, there were more patients 
outside of the safety range, as expected. The results are sum-
marized in Table 2. </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>Disputes on the safety of generic substitution have a long 
history, with a lot of conflicting reports. Most of the papers 
addressing the safety problem of generic substitution are case 
reports on the therapeutic inequivalence caused by substitu-
tion. By contrast, the 'pro-substitution' papers have mainly 
focused on the saving of medication costs in their own coun-
tries (10-13), without focusing on the additional costs that 
may be incurred by therapeutic failure as a result of generic 
substitution. Richton-Hewett et al. (14), however, measured 
both the medication cost and healthcare cost after switching 
branded warfarin to a generic in Boston City Hospital. In their 
report, the healthcare cost increase from more frequent hos-
pital visits and elongation of the admission period caused by 
generic substitution was greater than the medication cost 
saved. Likewise, Hellstrom et al. (15) also showed an increas-
ing number of adverse effects with increasing market shares 
of generics based on time-series data from 1972 to 1996. If 
the pharmacokinetic results of generic substitution are to be 
assessed, well-designed prospective studies are recommend-
ed. However, because it is not practical in clinical settings, 
Rosenbaum et al. (16) detected 20-30% lower phenytoin 
concentrations in generic formulation-treated patients than 
in those treated with the original formulation (Dilantin </p>

<p>� </p>

<p>) via 
retrospective analysis of the therapeutic drug monitoring data. 
Against this background, computer simulation is thought to 
be an appropriate method to predict the changes in drug expo-</p>

<p>sure in a large patient population after generic substitution. 
In simulation-based researches, a critical factor is the fideli-
ty or reliability of the model used to perform the simulation. 
In our model, the distribution of Pop Mean AUC of gener-
ics had the strongest influence on the AUC ratios. There are 
typically several tens of generics per original brand on the mar-
ket. It is impossible to know their mean AUC values and vari-
ance. BE study reports that contain such information are arc-
hived by companies and regulatory authorities but these are 
not to be publicized. Hence, the BSV of 20% and the RV of 
10-15% used in the present study were chosen for the con-
venience of simulation without regard to real BE data. How-
ever, the BSV does not influence the switch results as men-
tioned in the method section. When compared with the au-
thor's experiences in several repeated-dosing PK studies, the 
RV of 10-15% used herein may be a conservative condition, 
i.e. switch results in the real world may be worse than the sim-
ulated ones in this report. 
The AUC ratio histograms obtained by the simulation were 
influenced by both the Pop Mean AUCs and their variability 
(BSV and RV), as expected. In the model assumption, scenar-
ios C and D were given a broader range of Pop Mean AUC 
(80-123.5) for the generics compared with scenarios A and 
B. The shape of the Pop Mean AUC distribution was assumed 
to be uniform (evenly distributed) with an interval of 1.5 in 
scenarios C and D. The condition of uniform distribution as-
sumed herein may seem to be 'unfair' for the generic drugs, 
since the estimate of the mean AUC ratio, which is equiva-
lent to the Pop Mean AUC for the generics in this report, is 
known to be log-normally distributed with a 90% confidence 
interval within the 80-125% range, but not uniform-distribut-
ed. However, at the same time, none of the scenarios in this 
report had Pop Mean AUC values of the generics outside of 
the 80-125% range, a situation which may occur with a prob-
ability of less than 10% (tails on both sides of the distribution 
curve) in the case of 'log-normal distribution'. Therefore, the 
assumption of uniform distribution was not an unduly harsh 
condition to make the AUC changes after generic switch seem 
worse than they really are. 
The safety range of the AUC ratio (0.67 to 1.5) used in this 
study to estimate the proportion of patients falling outside of 
this range was determined to help the readers to interpret the 
AUC differences caused by switch. Although the limits of 
0.67 and 1.5 may be somewhat arbitrary, the proportion out-
side of the cutoff range helps us to estimate the possibility of 
therapeutic failure, especially for NTI drugs. In scenarios C 
and D, it may be concluded that roughly 10% of patients may 
experience therapeutic failure when substituted from one ge-
neric to another generic. Currently, not a country requests 
BE studies comparing a generic with another generic, where 
mean AUC and Cmax may differ by 45% in the most extreme 
case (80% generic versus 125% generic). This is why the 'gener-
ic to another generic' switch was found more dangerous than 
the 'original to generic' switch in this simulation study. </p>

<p>

<p>As with the simulation results herein, it is worth consid-
ering the surveys from patients who were exposed to gener-
ic substitution (from the original). In Norway, 36% of the 
patients had one or more negative experiences after switch 
(17). In Denmark, 6% of patients responded that he/she had 
experienced more side-effects from the substituted medicine, 
and 10% felt that the substituted medicine had had a weak-
er effect, although 85% of responders were positive about 
the substitution policy itself (18). In Germany, 37% of patients 
were skeptical towards generics because of their lower price 
(19). Such concerns will be considerably amplified in Korea, 
where a substantial proportion of marketed generics are sus-
pected to be of sub-standard quality. 
The problem of therapeutic inequivalence may be more 
serious in those generics approved without BE tests. In many 
countries, digestives, topical agents (creams, ointments etc.) 
and other parenteral formulations are approved without human 
PK studies. A case report of therapeutic failure by a generic 
digestive followed by recovery after switch to the original 
formulation (20) demonstrates that the therapeutic inequiv-
alence is not simply a theoretical possibility. The fact that 10 
generic acyclovir creams were found to have a bioavailabili-
ty of less than 50% of that of the original formulation in in 
vitro skin permeation experiments (21) also demonstrates the 
need to tighten the regulatory web on the topical generics 
approved without BE tests. Moreover, the quality of intra-
venous formulations also needs thorough examination to assure 
their safety and quality. This necessity seems to be greater for 
some macromolecule drugs, which tend to be harder to syn-
thesize and eliminate detrimental byproducts during the man-
ufacturing process. 
Generic prescription or substitution has been widely prac-
ticed in the US and EU countries for the purpose of health-
care cost containment. In Ontario, Canada, mandatory gener-
ic substitution-a more decisive policy of giving patients gener-
ic drugs, regardless of the prescription-was introduced in 2003 
(22). In 2007, however, it was reported that the proportion 
of switching back to the original was higher for antiepileptic 
agents, one of typical NTI drugs, than for other drugs. Alth-
ough the causes of switching back were not known, this report 
implies that the safety and effect of generic substitution of 
NTI drugs may not be guaranteed under mandatory gener-
ic substitution. The perspectives of pharmacists may be dif-
ferent, but they are unlikely to be free from concerns about 
the safety of patients either. In France, where generic substi-
tution has been possible since 1999, pharmacists are satisfied 
with the fact that they can exercise the 'substitution right' 
(23). However, only 42.5% of them were found to dispense 
generics to patients routinely, and 55% did so to specific pa-
tients only (23) for many reasons including safety concerns. 
A survey report from the US showing that many pharmacists 
have negative opinions on the generic warfarin substitution 
(24) is another example showing that pharmacists are also con-
cerned for the safety of NTI generics. </p>

<p>Through this simulation study, we were able to find that 
a significant proportion of patients may be exposed to the 
possibility of under-treatment or overdosing by the switch 
of drugs, especially when switched from a generic to anoth-
er generic. In conclusion, the present report supports the old 
notion that prescription drugs-especially the NTI drugs-should 
be carefully chosen by physicians based on the consideration 
of individual patient's condition, not by the governmental 
policy to save medication cost. </p>

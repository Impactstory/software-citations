<p>OBJECTIVE -To search for a better dietary approach to treat postprandial lipid abnormal-
ities and improve glucose control in type 2 diabetic patients. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -According to a randomized crossover de-
sign, 18 type 2 diabetic patients (aged 59 Ϯ 5 years; BMI 27 Ϯ 3 kg/m 
2 ) (means Ϯ SD) in 
satisfactory blood glucose control on diet or diet plus metformin followed a diet relatively rich in 
carbohydrates (52% total energy), rich in fiber (28g/1,000 kcal), and with a low glycemic index 
(58%) (high-carbohydrate/high-fiber diet) or a diet relatively low in carbohydrate (45%) and rich 
in monounsaturated fat (23%) (low-carbohydrate/high-monounsaturated fat diet) for 4 weeks. 
Thereafter, they shifted to the other diet for 4 more weeks. At the end of each period, plasma 
glucose, insulin, lipids, and lipoprotein fractions (separated by discontinuous density gradient 
ultracentrifugation) were determined on blood samples taken at fasting and over 6 h after a test 
meal having a similar composition as the corresponding diet. </p>

<p>RESULTS -In addition to a significant decrease in postprandial plasma glucose, insulin 
responses, and glycemic variability, the high-carbohydrate/high-fiber diet also significantly im-
proved the primary end point, since it reduced the postprandial incremental areas under the 
curve (IAUCs) of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, in particular, chylomicrons (cholesterol IAUC: 
0.05 Ϯ 0.01 vs. 0.08 Ϯ 0.02 mmol/l per 6 h; triglycerides IAUC: 0.71 Ϯ 0.35 vs. 1.03 Ϯ 0.58 
mmol/l per 6 h, P Ͻ 0.05). </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS -A diet rich in carbohydrate and fiber, essentially based on legumes, 
vegetables, fruits, and whole cereals, may be particularly useful for treating diabetic patients 
because of its multiple effects on different cardiovascular risk factors, including postprandial 
lipids abnormalities. </p>

<p>conditions and after a standard test meal) 
of two diets-one moderately rich in car-
bohydrate, rich in fiber, and with a low 
glycemic index and the other relatively 
low in carbohydrate and rich in MUFA. 
Because adipose tissue, mainly 
through its lipolytic activities, is consid-
ered as having a pivotal role in the buffer-
ing of lipid flux in the postprandial period 
(11), a further goal of our study was to 
evaluate the activities of lipoprotein lipase 
(LPL) and hormone-sensitive lipase 
(HSL) after consumption of the two diets 
as possible mechanisms of different ef-
fects on postprandial lipid metabolism. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND 
METHODS -A total of 19 type 2 di-
abetic patients were enrolled in the study, 
after giving their written informed con-
sent. There was one dropout because of 
concomitant family problems; therefore, 
12 men and 6 women, aged 59 Ϯ 5 years 
(means Ϯ SD), concluded the study. Pa-
tients were slightly overweight (BMI 27 Ϯ 
3 kg/m 
2 ), in satisfactory blood glucose 
control (A1C 6.9 Ϯ 0.7%) on diet alone 
(n ϭ 13) or diet plus metformin (n ϭ 5), 
and with normal fasting plasma lipid lev-
els. They were all sedentary and did not 
change their physical activity level 
throughout the study. The protocol was 
approved by the Federico II University 
Ethics Committee. </p>

<p>Sample size 
Based on differences in the postprandial 
responses of triglycerides in the chylomi-
crons and VLDL fractions between dia-
betic and control subjects (0.7 mmol/l per 
6 h, SD 0.85 mmol/l) (12), we considered 
as clinically relevant a 30% difference be-
tween the two treatments of the primary 
end point (postprandial incremental area 
of triglycerides content in chylomicrons 
and VLDL fraction). To detect this differ-
ence with an 80% power at a P value of 
5% (two-tailed), 13 patients had to be 
studied. </p>

<p>Study design 
The study was performed according to a 
randomized crossover design. After a 
run-in period of 4 weeks, during which 
patients were stabilized on their own diet, 
they followed, in alternate order, two 
isoenergetic diets, each for 4 weeks. One 
diet was relatively rich in carbohydrate, 
rich in dietary fiber both of soluble and 
insoluble type, and with a low glycemic 
index; the other was rich in MUFA, rela-
tively low in carbohydrate, low in dietary </p>

<p>fiber, and with a relatively high glycemic 
index (Table 1). The glycemic load of the 
high-carbohydrate/high-fiber diet was 
lower than that of the high-MUFA diet 
(155 vs. 205). The other components of 
the two diets, in particular, the saturated 
fat content, were similar (Table 1). Calo-
ries and nutrients of the diets were calcu-
lated from tables of food composition of 
the Italian Institute of Nutrition using the 
<rs id="software-1" type="software">MetaDieta</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Meteda s.r.l</rs>., Ascoli-
Piceno, Italy). The main components of 
the two diets were as follows: 1) a portion 
of legumes four times a week, one serving of 
pasta twice a week, and one serving of par-
boiled rice once a week; two servings of 
vegetables and two fruits per day; and 
whole-grain bread for the high-carbohy-
drate/high-fiber diet and 2) white bread, a 
serving of potatoes, rice, or pasta each twice 
weekly; a serving of pizza once a week; and 
use of vegetables and fruits low in fiber for 
the low-carbohydrate diet (a weekly meal 
schedule for both dietary treatments is 
shown in an online appendix, Tables S1 and 
S2, available at http://care.diabetesjournals. 
org/cgi/content/full/dc09-0266/DC1). 
To improve dietary compliance, pa-
tients were seen weekly by an experienced 
dietitian who, in addition, called them ev-
ery 2-3 days to ensure that they followed 
the diet assigned. Adherence to the two 
dietary treatments was evaluated by a 
3-day food record filled in by the patients 
at the end of the two periods. </p>

<p>Experimental procedures 
At the end of each dietary intervention 
period, patients underwent the following 
procedures: 1) 12-h fasting blood sam-</p>

<p>pling for the determination of total, LDL, 
and HDL cholesterol and triglycerides; 2) 
home self-measurement of triglyceride 
and glucose levels with samples taken at 
fasting, immediately before, and 2 and 3 h 
after lunch and before dinner for 2 days at 
the end of each dietary treatment; and 3) a 
test meal with a composition similar to 
the dietary treatment being followed, with 
blood samples taken at fasting (at least 
12 h) and 2, 4, and 6 h after the meal to 
evaluate glucose, insulin, cholesterol, and 
triglycerides in plasma and lipoprotein 
subfractions. The test meal was per-
formed in 12 patients. The composition of 
the test meal performed at the end of the 
high-fiber diet was 52% carbohydrate 
(41% starch, 11% soluble), 30% fat (7% 
saturated), and 18% protein and consisted 
of beans and pasta soup plus an apple. The 
composition of the test meal performed at 
the end of the low-carbohydrate/high-
MUFA diet was 45% carbohydrate (34% 
starch, 11% soluble), 37% fat (7% satu-
rated), and 18% protein and consisted of a 
potato gateau (a pie made of mashed potato, 
whole milk, eggs, cheese, ham, and butter) 
plus orange juice. The energy content of the 
two test meals was 948 kcal. 4) Six hours 
after the test meal, a needle biopsy of ab-
dominal subcutaneous adipose tissue was 
taken for the determination of LPL and HSL 
activities. </p>

poprotein subfractions were isolated by 
discontinuous density gradient ultracen-
trifugation, as previously described (5). 
Briefly, three consecutive runs were per-
formed at 15°C and at 40,000 rpm to float 
chylomicrons (Svedberg flotation unit 
[Sf] Ͼ400), large VLDL (Sf 60 -400), and 
small VLDL (Sf 20 -60). Intermediate-
density lipoproteins (Sf 12-20) and LDLs 
(Sf 0 -12) were recovered from the gradi-
ent after the Sf 20 -60 particles had been 
collected. HDLs were isolated by a precip-
itation method. 
Adipose tissue lipases activities. 
Heparin-releasable LPL, total LPL, and 
HSL activities were determined as previ-
ously described (13). 
Other measurements. Cholesterol and 
triglyceride concentrations were assayed 
by enzymatic colorimetric methods; 
plasma insulin concentrations were ac-
quired by enzyme-linked immunosor-
bent assay. 
Home self-measurements of triglycer-
ide levels were performed by a GCT Ac-
cutrend instrument (Roche Diagnostics, 
Mannheim, Germany), a method already 
validated (3). </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
Data are expressed as means Ϯ SD unless 
otherwise stated. Postprandial incremen-
tal areas were calculated by the trapezoi-
dal method as the area under the curve 
above the baseline value (IAUC). Coeffi-
cients of variations of plasma glucose at 
different points after test meals were eval-
uated as an index of postprandial glyce-
mic variability (14). Differences between 
the two diets were evaluated by ANOVA 
for repeated measures and t test for paired 
data. Two-tailed tests were used, and a 
P Ͻ 0.05 was considered statistically sig-
nificant. Variables not normally distrib-
uted were analyzed after logarithmic 
transformation or by nonparametric tests. 
Because there was no carry-over ef-
fect, the results of patients starting with 
either diet were put together. The statisti-
cal analysis was performed according to 
standard methods using the Statistical 
Package for Social Sciences software 
(<rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS/PC</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS</rs>, Chicago, IL). </p>

<p>RESULTS -There were no changes in 
body weight during the experiment (73.0 
kg after both dietary treatments). The 
compliance to the two diets was optimal, 
as shown by the average composition of 
the diet followed by subjects (Table 1). As 
expected, the two diets followed by pa-
tients were significantly different for total </p>

<p>fat, MUFA, carbohydrate, fiber, glycemic 
index, and glycemic load (Table 1). Both 
diets were well accepted by patients. </p>

<p>Fasting plasma lipoproteins 
At the end of the high-carbohydrate/high-
fiber diet, there was a significant reduc-
tion of total cholesterol (4.20 Ϯ 0.70 vs. 
4.40 Ϯ 0.78 mmol/l, P Ͻ 0.05), LDL cho-
lesterol (2.62 Ϯ 0.60 vs. 2.82 Ϯ 0.62 
mmol/l, P Ͻ 0.05), and HDL cholesterol 
(0.98 Ϯ 0.25 vs. 1.06 Ϯ 0.26 mmol/l, P Ͻ 
0.05) and an increase in HDL triglycer-
ides (0.20 Ϯ 0.05 vs. 0.18 Ϯ 0.05 mmol/l, 
P Ͻ 0.05) in comparison with the low-
carbohydrate/high-MUFA diet, whereas 
triglyceride levels in plasma (1.16 Ϯ 0.38 
vs. 1.07 Ϯ 0.39 mmol/l) and LDL (0.41 Ϯ 
0.11 vs. 0.41 Ϯ 0.09 mmol/l) were 
similar. </p>

<p>Home self-monitoring 
Blood glucose levels measured by patients 
(average of two daily profiles) were signifi-
cantly lower during the high-carbohydrate/ 
high-fiber diet both 2 h (7.2 Ϯ 1.1 vs. 
9.2 Ϯ 2.9 mmol/l; P Ͻ 0.05) and 3 h 
(5.9 Ϯ 1.3 vs. 7.3 Ϯ 1.5 mmol/l; P Ͻ 
0.05) after lunch. Similarly, self-
monitored triglyceride levels (average of 
two daily profiles) were 30% lower 3 h 
after lunch. </p>

<p>Plasma glucose and insulin 
responses to test meals 
After the high-carbohydrate/high-fiber 
test meal, performed at the end of the cor-
responding diet, plasma glucose concen-
trations were lower in the first part of the 
postprandial curve, especially after 2 h 
(P ϭ 0.06) (Fig. 1A). The same pattern 
was observed for plasma insulin, signifi-
cantly lower at the second and third hour 
(P Ͻ 0.05 for both) than after the low-
carbohydrate/high-MUFA test meal per-
formed at the end of the corresponding 
diet (Fig. 1D). ANOVA for repeated mea-
sures was statistically significant for 
plasma glucose (P Ͻ 0.05) and plasma 
insulin curves (P Ͻ 0.008). The combina-
tion of the effects on plasma glucose and 
insulin led to a reduction of the insulin-
to-glucose ratio both at the second 
(0.44 Ϯ 0.30 vs. 0.52 Ϯ 0.46) and third 
hour (0.39 Ϯ 0.29 vs. 0.49 Ϯ 0.34; P Ͻ 
0.05) after the high-carbohydrate/high-
fiber test meal. On the contrary, plasma 
glucose and insulin levels were both sig-
nificantly higher 6 h after the high-
carbohydrate/high-fiber meal than after 
the other test meal (P Ͻ 0.05) (Fig. 1A 
and D). These patterns in the postpran-</p>

<p>dial curve corresponded to 1) a nearly 
50% decrease in plasma glucose IAUC 
until the third hour (P Ͻ 0.05) (Fig. 1B); 
2) a significant reduction in insulin IAUC 
by 14 and 21%, at 3 and 6 h, respectively 
(P Ͻ 0.05) (Fig. 1E); and 3) a significant 
decrease of nearly 50% in postprandial 
glycemic variability (P Ͻ 0.02) (Fig. 1C). </p>

<p>Plasma lipid and lipoprotein 
responses to test meals 
At the end of the high-carbohydrate/high-
fiber diet, postprandial IAUC of plasma 
triglycerides decreased by 31% compared 
with the low-carbohydrate/high-MUFA 
diet (1.87 Ϯ 1.22 vs. 2.70 Ϯ 1.58 mmol/l 
per 6 h), whereas no significant differ-
ences were observed for plasma choles-
terol IAUC. In terms of peak postprandial 
changes, the 4-h increments were 0.4 Ϯ 
0.3 mmol/l for the high-carbohydrate/ 
high-fiber diet and 0.6 Ϯ 0.4 mmol/l for 
the other diet (P Ͻ 0.05). 
The postprandial responses of 
triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are reported 
in Fig. 2. Both triglycerides and choles-
terol in chylomicrons were lower after the 
test meal performed at the end of the 
high-carbohydrate/high-fiber diet, and 
the IAUC was significantly reduced by 31 
and 46%, respectively (P Ͻ 0.05 for both) 
(Fig. 2A and B). Similarly reduced was the 
triglyceride content of large VLDL (IAUC 
1.46 Ϯ 0.94 vs. 1.97 Ϯ 1.22 mmol/l per 
6 h, P Ͻ 0.06) (Fig. 2D), small VLDL 
(IAUC Ϫ0.21 Ϯ 0.24 vs. Ϫ0.15 Ϯ 0.21 
mmol/l per 6 h, P ϭ 0.07), and LDL 
(IAUC Ϫ0.05 Ϯ 0.06 vs. 0.17 Ϯ 0.05 
mmol/l per 6 h, P Ͻ 0.05). No differences 
were observed in the postprandial re-
sponse of the other lipoproteins (data not 
shown). </p>

<p>Lipases activities 
Both total and heparin-releasable LPL ac-
tivities in adipose tissue were not signifi-
cantly different at the end of the two diets 
(total LPL activity: 2,792 Ϯ 958 vs. 
3,375 Ϯ 2,251 nmol fatty acid per gram 
per hour; heparin releasable LPL activity: 
146 Ϯ 70 vs. 184 Ϯ 117 nmol fatty acid 
per gram per hour). Likewise, no differ-
ence was observed in HSL activity (616 Ϯ 
237 vs. 676 Ϯ 210 nmol fatty acid per 
gram per hour). </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS -This study clearly 
shows, for the first time, that a diet mod-
erately rich in carbohydrate, rich in di-
etary fiber, and, consequently, with low 
glycemic index and glycemic load, essen-
tially based on consumption of legumes, </p>

<p>vegetables, fruits, and whole cereals, in-
duces a significant reduction of postpran-
dial lipoproteins, particularly chylomi-
crons, in type 2 diabetic patients. This effect 
was observed in experimental conditions, 
i.e., after a standard test meal, but also in 
everyday life, where there was a 30% re-
duction of plasma triglycerides 3 h after 
lunch, despite the well-known high day-
to-day triglyceride variability (20% in our 
data). 
Moreover, our results confirm that 
this kind of diet is to be preferred to a diet 
low in carbohydrate and rich in MUFA for 
its effects on: 
1) Postprandial blood glucose con-
trol, with lower peaks in the first part of 
the postprandial period. This blunted 
postprandial profile implies a reduced 
variability of blood glucose levels (almost 
halved in our study), considered so im-
portant in the prevention of cardiovascu-
lar disease in diabetic patients (15), as 
well as a lower risk of late postprandial 
hypoglycemia (16). 
2) Postprandial insulin levels, which 
are significantly reduced concomitantly 
with the presence of lower blood glucose 
levels, suggesting an improvement in in-
sulin action. 
3) LDL cholesterol levels, signifi-
cantly reduced also in normocholester-</p>

<p>olemic type 2 diabetic patients, 
reinforcing the data already obtained in 
patients with higher LDL cholesterol lev-
els (10). This result, which may be con-
sidered of small entity (a 9% reduction), 
is, instead, important from a clinical point 
of view considering the need to constantly 
lower LDL cholesterol values, especially 
in type 2 diabetic patients (6). 
The only drawback of the diet rich in 
carbohydrate and fiber is the lower levels 
of fasting HDL cholesterol obtained com-
pared with the diet low in carbohydrate 
and rich in MUFAs. Moreover, it is im-
portant to underline that any interven-
tion able to reduce LDL cholesterol 
levels generally leads also to a reduction 
in HDL cholesterol. Furthermore, a pre-
vious study has shown that the decrease 
in HDL cholesterol after a low-fat/high-
carbohydrate diet is limited to HDL 3 (17), 
which is the HDL subfraction with less 
antiatherogenic properties. 
Our results emphasize the clear im-
portance of the quality of carbohydrate, 
beside that of their amount (18). Indeed, 
the few studies that have so far looked at 
the effects of high-carbohydrate versus 
high-MUFA diets on postprandial lipid 
metabolism compared diets rich in MUFA 
with diets rich in carbohydrate, but not in </p>

<p>dietary fiber, and with a low glycemic in-
dex (19 -21). 
How can the two dietary approaches 
act on the postprandial response of triglyc-
eride-rich lipoproteins? We looked at the 
possible effects of the two diets on lipol-
ysis in adipose tissue, considering the cru-
cial role of this tissue in partitioning the 
postprandial lipids (11). However, both 
LPL and HSL activities were not different 
at the end of either diet. This suggests that 
the two diets might act on other sites, par-
ticularly on those involved in the absorp-
tion of dietary fatty acids and cholesterol 
and the production of chylomicrons and 
VLDL, not only through their nutrient 
composition but also for their different 
combination of foods and for the presence 
of other components. On the one hand, 
since low-carbohydrate/high-MUFA diets 
are richer in the amount of fat, which is 
one of the main determinants of post-
prandial lipid response (22), they may in-
duce a higher absorption of dietary fatty 
acids, which would result in a higher in-
testinal production of chylomicrons. On 
the other hand, since the high-
carbohydrate/high-fiber diet is at the 
same time rich in carbohydrate and di-
etary fiber, it may act in different ways, 
i.e., by slowing down gastric empting; re-
ducing the absorption of glucose, choles-</p>

<p>
terol, and fatty acids; and, finally, 
reducing the intestinal production and se-
cretion of chylomicrons, as suggested by 
studies performed both in vitro and in 
vivo (23). Moreover, since the high-
carbohydrate/high-fiber diet also reduces 
postprandial plasma glucose and insulin, 
it is likely that both effects may reduce de 
novo lipogenesis, which is stimulated by 
glucose and insulin levels (23) and may 
be particularly relevant in type 2 diabetic 
patients, where it accounts for 25% of 
VLDL synthesis (24). Moreover, our high-
carbohydrate diet, being rich in fiber, also 
induced an improvement in insulin resis-
tance, as suggested by the lower insulin-
to-glucose ratios, which is relevant given 
the well-known key role played by insulin 
resistance in determining postprandial li-
poprotein abnormalities (25). 
Clinical relevance of our results lies 
on the fact that postprandial lipemia is, 
according to recent prospective studies 
(1,2), an independent cardiovascular risk 
factor. On the basis of these studies, a dif-</p>

<p>ference in postprandial triglycerides of 
0.25 mmol/l such as that observed be-
tween our two diets could mean a reduc-
tion in cardiovascular risk of ϳ25%. It 
has to be underlined that our results have 
been obtained with a nonpharmacologi-
cal intervention comparing two diets both 
recommended and in individuals with 
quite low lipid levels. </p>

<p>Limitations 
Participants in our study were type 2 dia-
betic patients in relatively good blood glu-
cose control, with quite normal plasma 
lipid levels, who already used a diet rela-
tively rich in carbohydrate and fiber. 
Therefore, we cannot extrapolate our re-
sults to all type 2 diabetic patients. How-
ever, it has to be considered that a similar 
type of high-carbohydrate/high-fiber diet 
induced similar, if not better, results on 
blood glucose control and fasting lipid 
metabolism in type 2 diabetic patients not 
in satisfactory blood glucose control and 
with hyperlipidemia (10,18). Another </p>

<p>point to be stressed is the length of the 
intervention: although 1 month for each 
diet cannot be considered a long-term ex-
periment, it is certainly sufficiently long 
enough to induce changes in glucose and 
lipid metabolism. 
In conclusion, a diet relatively high 
in carbohydrates, rich in dietary fiber, 
with a relatively low glycemic index and 
a low glycemic load, essentially based 
on consumption of legumes, vegetables, 
fruit, and whole cereals, may be partic-
ularly useful for the treatment of type 2 
diabetic patients on the basis of its mul-
tiple effects on different cardiovascular 
risk factors, including postprandial 
lipid abnormalities. </p>

<p>ABSTRACT </p>

<p>REBASE is a comprehensive database of informa-
tion about restriction enzymes, DNA methyl-
transferases and related proteins involved in the 
biological process of restriction-modification 
(R-M). It contains fully referenced information 
about recognition and cleavage sites, isoschi-
zomers, neoschizomers, commercial availability, 
methylation sensitivity, crystal and sequence data. 
Experimentally characterized homing endonucle-
ases are also included. The fastest growing 
segment of REBASE contains the putative R-M 
systems found in the sequence databases.

<p>Figure 1. The graph shows the numbers of R-M systems entering REBASE since its inception in 1975. The open bars show systems that have been 
characterized either biochemically or genetically. The black bars show the increasing accumulation of potential R-M systems that have been found 
by bioinformatic analysis of sequences in GenBank. The surge in 2004 represents the addition of metagenomic sequences from the Sargasso Sea 
collecting expedition (9). </p>

<p>OBJECTIVE -To examine whether concentrations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
(25[OH]D) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) are associated with surrogate markers of insulin 
resistance (IR) in U.S. adults without physician-diagnosed diabetes. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -Cross-sectional data (n 3,206) from the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2006 were analyzed. </p>

<p>RESULTS -The age-adjusted prevalence of hyperinsulinemia, high homeostasis model as-
sessment-IR, high GHb, and fasting and 2-h hyperglycemia decreased linearly across quintiles of 
25(OH)D but increased linearly across quintiles of PTH (except for a quadratic trend for fasting 
hyperglycemia). After extensive adjustment for potential confounders, the relationships between 
25(OH)D and the markers of IR and 2-h hyperglycemia persisted. Only hyperinsulinemia was 
positively associated with PTH (P 0.05). </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS -Among U.S. adults without physician-diagnosed diabetes, low concen-
trations of serum 25(OH)D were associated with markers of IR. The role of PTH in IR deserves 
further investigation. </p>

<p>T </p>

<p>he role of vitamin D and parathyroid 
hormone (PTH) in metabolic syn-
drome and diabetes is receiving in-
creased attention. Insulin resistance (IR) 
may represent a potential mechanism 
linking vitamin D and PTH to these con-
ditions. The inverse associations between 
vitamin D and fasting insulin concentra-
tions or the homeostasis model assess-
ment of IR (HOMA-IR) index have been 
reported in some (1-5) but not all studies 
(6). Moreover, evidence linking PTH to 
markers of IR is limited and inconsistent </p>

<p>(7-9). This study examined whether se-
rum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) 
and PTH are associated with surrogate 
markers of IR in U.S. adults without phy-
sician-diagnosed diabetes. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND 
METHODS -We used data from the 
National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) 2003-2006. Par-
ticipants who were aged 20 years, 
attended the morning examination after 
fasting 8 h, and had not been diagnosed </p>

<p>with diabetes were included as were par-
ticipants with undiagnosed diabetes (fast-
ing glucose 126 mg/dl or GHb 6.5%) 
(10). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations 
were measured using a radioimmunoas-
say procedure. Serum PTH concentra-
tions were measured on the Elecsys 1010 
analyzer using an electrochemiluminescent 
procedure. The quintiles of 25(OH)D and 
PTH were created after taking into account 
the sampling weights. 
Plasma concentrations of fasting and 
2-h glucose, fasting insulin, and GHb 
were adjusted for differences in labora-
tory methodology between NHANES 
2003-2004 and 2005-2006. Oral glu-
cose tolerance test data were available 
only for NHANES 2005-2006. We de-
fined fasting hyperglycemia as a fasting 
glucose 100 mg/dl, 2-h hyperglycemia 
as a 2-h glucose 140 mg/dl, and high 
GHb as a value of 6.0%. HOMA-IR in-
dex was calculated as (fasting plasma in-
sulin [mU/l] fasting plasma glucose 
[mmol/l])/22.5. Hyperinsulinemia and 
high HOMA-IR were defined using the 
weighted 75th percentiles. 
Covariates in our analyses included 
age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smok-
ing, physical activity, alcohol drinking, 
BMI, abdominal obesity, and serum cal-
cium concentrations. From 3,551 partic-
ipants without physician-diagnosed 
diabetes, 3,206 (1,582 male subjects and 
1,624 female subjects) remained in our 
analyses after excluding those who had 
missing values for study variables. The 
prevalence of surrogate markers of IR was 
age-standardized to the 2000 U.S. popu-
lation. Linear trends across quintiles of 
25(OH)D and PTH were tested using or-
thogonal contrasts in <rs type="software">SUDAAN</rs> software. 
Multiple logistic regression analyses were 
conducted to test associations of 25(OH)D 
or PTH with markers of IR. </p>

<p>RESULTS -Among 3,206 partici-
pants, 118 had undiagnosed diabetes. </p>

The age-adjusted prevalence was 5.7% 
(95% CI 4.8 -6.7%) for high GHb, 30.6 
(27.8 -33.6) for fasting hyperglycemia, 
and 20.4 (17.7-23.4) for 2-h hyperglyce-
mia. The prevalence of all outcome mea-
sures and the multivariate-adjusted 
odds ratios (ORs) for hyperinsulinemia, 
high HOMA-IR, high GHb, and 2-h hy-
perglycemia decreased linearly across 
quintiles of 25(OH)D (P 0.05 for all) 
(Table 1). After excluding participants 
without physician-diagnosed diabetes 
but who had diabetes based on fasting 
glucose or GHb values, similar results 
were observed except the significant asso-
ciation between high GHb and 25(OH)D 
disappeared. 
Interactions between race/ethnicity 
and 25(OH)D for outcome measures were 
not significant in the full models. 
The prevalence of hyperinsulinemia, 
high HOMA-IR, high GHb, and 2-h hy-
perglycemia increased linearly, and the 
prevalence of fasting hyperglycemia in-
creased nonlinearly across quintiles of 
PTH. After adjusting for demographic 
and lifestyle factors, the ORs for hyperin-
sulinemia, high HOMA-IR, and high GHb 
were significantly higher in the highest 
than in the lowest quintile of PTH, and 
significantly increasing trends existed for 
all measures except for 2-h hyperglyce-
mia. After further adjusting for all 
potential confounders, most of the as-
sociations lost statistical significance; 
only an increasing trend for hyperinsu-
linemia across quintiles of PTH per-
sisted (P 0.05). These results did not 
change much after excluding participants 
without physician-diagnosed diabetes 
but who had diabetes based on fasting 
glucose or GHb values. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS -Our findings of 
an inverse association between 25(OH)D 
and IR among adults without physician-
diagnosed diabetes are consistent with 
previous findings from cross-sectional 
(1-4) and prospective (5) studies. These 
results offer further support that lower 
concentrations of 25(OH)D may be a pre-
dictor of increased likelihood of diabetes 
in the population (11-14). 
Compared with previous studies that 
examined the associations of 25(OH)D 
with IR (1-4), an advantage of our study 
was that we were able to simultaneously 
examine the associations between serum 
25(OH)D and PTH-both of which play 
an essential role in regulating calcium ho-
meostasis-and IR. In addition, we were 
able to adjust for overall obesity (i.e., 
BMI) and abdominal obesity, which were 
strong confounders for the analyses. The 
expression of vitamin D receptors in both 
pancreatic -cells and skeletal muscle 
cells, which, upon activation by vitamin D 
supplementation, result in increased in-
sulin release and responsiveness to insu-
lin for glucose transport (14), may serve 
as an underlying mechanism. 
Our results regarding possible racial/ 
ethnic disparities in the associations of 
25(OH)D with IR conflict with those from 
Scragg et al. (3). Given the high propor-
tion of African Americans with vitamin D 
deficiency or insufficiency, the issue of 
possible racial/ethnic disparities deserves 
further investigation (15). 
Primary hyperparathyroidism was as-
sociated with impaired glucose tolerance, 
insulin insensitivity, and diabetes (7). 
However, a significant correlation be-
tween PTH and HOMA-IR was observed 
in adults aged 70 years with an average 
BMI of 27 kg/m 2 (8), but not in middle-</p>

<p>aged, morbidly obese adults (average BMI 
44.7 kg/m 2 ) (9). These studies were con-
ducted in selected populations, and the 
data analyses did not adequately control 
for potential confounders. Our study, 
based on a nationally representative sam-
ple, showed a significant association be-
tween PTH and hyperinsulinemia after 
adjusting for potential confounders. 
However, analyses limited to participants 
with concentrations of 25(OH)D 30 
ng/ml (n 2,518), a point at which PTH 
concentrations begin to increase, revealed 
no associations between PTH and hyper-
insulinemia or HOMA-IR. 
Our study was limited by the inability 
to establish the causality between 25(OH)D 
and IR based on our cross-sectional study 
and by the inability to account for sunlight 
exposure due to lack of data. 
In conclusion, low concentrations of 
25(OH)D were associated with markers 
of IR among U.S. adults without physi-
cian-diagnosed diabetes. Future prospec-
tive studies and intervention trials are 
needed to confirm the associations of 
25(OH)D with IR and to further investi-
gate the role of PTH in IR. </p>

<p>OBJECTIVE -To evaluate the effects of missed insulin boluses for snacks in youth with type 
1 diabetes. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -Three months of simultaneous continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusion and continuous glucose monitoring data from nine subjects were 
retrospectively evaluated. Glucose excursions between 1330 and 1700 h were defined as relating 
to snacks with insulin or snacks with no insulin administered. Area under the curve Ͼ180 mg/dl 
(AUC Ͼ180), average ⌬ glucose, and rate of change were analyzed and compared within and 
between groups. </p>

<p>RESULTS -A total of 94 snacks without insulin and 101 snacks with insulin were analyzed. 
Snacks without insulin had significantly higher log (AUC Ͼ180 ϩ 1) (1.26 vs. 0.44 mg/dl per 
event; P Ͻ 0.001), ⌬ glucose (114 vs. 52 mg/dl; P Ͻ 0.001), and average rate of change (1.3 vs. 
1.1 mg/dl per minute; P Ͻ 0.001). </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS -This study shows that afternoon snacks without insulin boluses are com-
mon and result in significantly higher glucose excursions than snacks with insulin administration. </p>

<p>revious studies have demonstrated 
the deleterious effect of missed insu-
lin doses for meals (1-4). None, 
however, have examined the effect of 
missed insulin boluses for snacks. Be-
cause youth frequently snack when unsu-
pervised, it is likely that missed insulin 
boluses are even more common for 
snacks than for meals. The purpose of this 
investigation was to use data from contin-
uous glucose monitoring (CGM) and con-
tinuous subcutaneous insulin infusion 
(CSII) together to evaluate the glycemic 
profiles of missed insulin boluses for af-
ternoon snacks. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND 
METHODS -This is a retrospective 
(Institutional Review Board approved) 
analysis of 810 days of CSII and CGM 
data from nine youth with diabetes. All 
subjects used the Minimed Paradigm 
REAL Time System (Northridge, CA) for </p>

<p>insulin delivery and CGM. Reports were 
downloaded using <rs type="software">Medtronic CareLink</rs> 
software. Afternoon snacks were identi-
fied on CGM as glucose excursions be-
ginning between 1330 and 1700 h. A 
glucose excursion was considered re-
solved when glucose levels remained 
steady for Ն15 min. Glucose excursions 
with incomplete CGM data or CSII sus-
pension Ͼ15 min were discarded. Glu-
cose excursions were identified as a 
snack with no insulin (SNI) or a snack 
with insulin (SWI) as described below, 
and possible snacks not fitting these cri-
teria were excluded from analysis. 
SNI criteria were as follows: 1) no bo-
lus administered within Ϯ30 min of the 
beginning of the glucose excursion, 2) in-
crease in glucose level Ն50 mg/dl, 3) av-
erage rate of change from baseline to peak 
of excursion Ն0.8 mg/dl per minute, 4) 
starting glucose level Ͼ80 mg/dl (to ex-
clude treatment of hypoglycemia), and 5) </p>

<p>determined not to be the dinner meal. 
Carbohydrate contents for snacks are not 
known for SNI. 
SWI criteria were as follows: 1) bolus 
administered within Ϯ30 min of the be-
ginning of the glucose excursion, 2) de-
termined not to be the dinner meal, and 3) 
determined not to be an exclusive cor-
rection bolus (confirmed on pump 
download). 
Each glucose excursion was charac-
terized by baseline glucose level, peak 
glucose level, end glucose level, duration 
of excursion, time spent Ͼ180 mg/dl, 
area under the curve Ͼ180 mg/dl (AUC 
Ͼ180), total amplitude of excursion (⌬ 
glucose), average rate of change, and in-
sulin administered. The study's primary 
outcome was the comparison between the 
AUC Ͼ180 of the glucose excursions for 
SNI and SWI. Secondary outcomes in-
cluded comparing the average rate of 
change and ⌬ glucose for SNI and SWI. 
All statistical analysis used Bonferro-
ni's adjusted P values for multiple com-
parisons. Results are expressed as mean Ϯ 
1 SD. Exploratory analyses revealed pos-
itive skew in the outcome variables (AUC 
Ͼ180, ⌬ glucose, and rate of change). Be-
cause AUC Ͼ180 was used, this resulted 
in a zero inflated distribution; thus, a two-
stage model was used. Generalized esti-
mating equations were used to determine 
the distribution of events with blood glu-
cose levels Յ180 versus Ͼ180 (5) be-
tween SNI and SWI. Mixed models were 
applied by regressing log(AUCϾ180 ϩ 
1.0), log(⌬ glucose), and log(rate of 
change) on to SNI/SWI (unbolused or bo-
lused snack) adjusting for age, sex, and 
repeated measures on subjects. Results 
are presented as mean or geometric mean 
and 95% CI. A general linear mixed-
model approach suggested by Cnaan et al. 
(6) was used to model blood glucose 
curves. </p>

<p>RESULTS -Data from nine subjects 
(five female) with a mean A1C of 7.6 Ϯ 
0.7%, mean duration of diabetes of 8.6 Ϯ 
6.3 years, and a mean age of 15.1 Ϯ 8.8 
years were analyzed. Of 195 glucose ex-
cursions identified, 94 were classified as 
SNI and 101 as SWI. Baseline glucose val-
ues between SNI and SWI were not sig-
nificantly different (P ϭ 1.0). A total of 76 </p>

<p>of 94 (81.7%) SNI resulted in blood glu-
cose levels Ͼ180 compared with 51 of 
101 (50.5%), for a resulting OR of 4.80 
(95% CI 2.46 -9.40) (P Ͻ 0.0001 after 
adjusting for age, sex, and repeated mea-
sures among subjects). Mean time spent 
above 180 mg/dl was 105 Ϯ 89 min for 
SNI and 34 Ϯ 42 min for SWI. The aver-
age glucose excursion for SNI began at 
124 Ϯ 47 mg/dl, peaked at 252 Ϯ 65 
mg/dl after 100 Ϯ 58 min, and resolved 
after 175 Ϯ 97 min at 157 Ϯ 59 mg/dl 
(Fig. 1). The average glucose excursion 
for SWI began at 130 Ϯ 51 mg/dl, peaked 
at 191 Ϯ 55 mg/dl after 53 Ϯ 27 min, and 
resolved after 98 Ϯ 48 min at 145 Ϯ 49 
mg/dl. Both the main effects of time and 
SNI versus SWI were significant (P Ͼ 
0.0001) as well as the second order effects 
and interactions concluding that the two 
curves were significantly different (P Ͻ 
0.0001). A table of the ratio of covariate 
effects and confidence intervals is in-
cluded in the online appendix, which is 
available at http://care.diabetesjournals.org/ 
cgi/content/full/dc09-1840/DC1. 
Glucose excursions from SNI had a 
mean log (AUC Ͼ180 ϩ 1) of 1.26 (95% 
CI 1.06 -1.46) compared with 0.44 mg/dl 
per event (95% CI 0.31-0.57) for SWI </p>

<p>(P Ͻ 0.001). Neither age nor sex had a 
significant effect on AUC Ͼ180 (P ϭ 1.0 
and P ϭ 0.50, respectively). 
The ⌬ glucose-adjusted mean for SNI 
(114 mg/dl [95% CI 101-129]) was sig-
nificantly different (P Ͻ 0.001) from SWI 
(52 mg/dl [47-59]). Age was not found to 
have an effect (P ϭ 0.08). 
The average rate of change was signif-
icantly different (P Ͻ 0.005) between SNI 
(1.3 [95% CI 1.2-1.5]) and SWI (1.1 mg/ 
dl/min [1.0 -1.2]). Neither age nor sex 
significantly affected the rate of change 
(P ϭ 1.0 for both). </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS -This study shows 
that when insulin is omitted for afternoon 
snacks, the area under the curve (Ͼ180 
mg/dl) is twice that of excursions for bo-
lused snacks. Furthermore, SNI excur-
sions demonstrated a steeper increase in 
glucose levels and twice the amplitude of 
SWI excursions. In this study, ϳ50% of 
boluses for snacks (94 of 195) were 
missed. 
Diabetes care providers often put 
much emphasis on mealtime insulin bo-
luses but fail to focus on snacks. Because 
snacking involves smaller amounts of </p>

<p>food over a longer period of time when 
compared with meals, the glycemic pro-
files are different. Future prospective 
studies should include many more sub-
jects, as well as data relating to insulin 
reduction and food intake with exercise, 
to further characterize these excursions. 
Overall, missed insulin boluses for snacks 
contribute to significant hyperglycemia. 
Diabetes care providers need to stress the 
importance of bolusing for snacks as well 
as for meals. </p>

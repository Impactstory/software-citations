<p>The genus Marasmius was considered a rather homogene-
ous group until the end of the last century (e.g. Antonín &amp; 
Noordeloos 1993). However, Moncalvo et al. (2002) showed 
that it is polyphyletic and its members belong to a number of 
distinct clades (/omphalotaceae, /physalacriaceae, /maras-
miaceae). According to other studies (Wilson &amp; Desjardin 2005, 
Matheny et al. 2006), only the sections Marasmius, Hygrome­ 
trici, Globulares and Sicci belong to Marasmius s.str. (family 
Marasmiaceae), whereas species of the sections Globulares 
and Sicci belong to one section called Globulares. Moreover, 
species of this section forming a hymeniform pileipellis of 
smooth (Globulares) or broom cells (Sicci) do not even belong 
to separate subsections, but are intermixed (Desjardin pers. 
comm.). </p>

<p>In this paper, South Korean species of Globulares with smooth 
pileipellis cells and no setae (not mixed with broom cells of the 
Siccus-type and well-developed setae = former sect. Sicci, ser. 
Spinulosi) are studied as part of a project on the genus Maras­ 
mius and related taxa in the Republic of Korea. </p>

<p>MATERIALS AND METHODS </p>

<p>Macroscopic and microscopic studies </p>

<p>Macroscopic descriptions of collected specimens are based 
on fresh basidiocarps and made by the first and the second 
author. Microscopic features are described from dried material 
mounted in H 2 O, KOH, Melzer's reagent and Congo Red using 
an Olympus BX-50 light microscope with a magnification of 
×1 000. For basidiospores, the factors E (quotient of length and 
width in any one spore) and Q (mean of E-values) are used. 
Authors of fungal names are cited according to the International 
Plant Names Index Authors website (http://www.ipni.org/ipni/au-
thorsearchpage.do). Colour abbreviations follow Kornerup &amp; 
Wanscher (1983) and herbarium abbreviations are according to 
Holmgren &amp; Holmgren (1998). For the list of studied specimens, 
including GenBank numbers, see Table 1. </p>

<p>DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing </p>

<p>DNA extraction was undertaken as described previously by Lee 
&amp; Taylor (1990). Genomic DNA was extracted using a small 
piece (3 -4 mm 3 ) of the basidiocarp. </p>

<p>PCR primers LR0R (5' ACC CGC TGA ACT TAA GC 3') and 
LR7 (5' TAC TAC CAC CAA GAT CT 3') were used for amplifi-
cation of the LSU (the nuclear large ribosomal subunit) region 
of rDNA (Moncalvo et al. 2002). PCR cycling started with 3 min 
at 94 °C, denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 45 s at 
45 °C, and extension for 90 s at 72 °C. Thirty-five cycles were 
run with the first denaturation and last extension times. </p>

<p>PCR amplification of rDNA ITS (the internal transcribed spacer) 
region was performed according to the modified method of 
Gardes &amp; Bruns (1993). The forward primer ITS1-F (5' CTT 
GGT CAT TTA GAG GAA GTA A 3') and reverse primer ITS4-B 
(5' CAG GAG ACT TGT ACA CGG TCC AG 3') were used for 
selective amplification of the complete ITS region of rDNA. 
Temperature cycling was performed with denaturation for 30 s 
at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 56 °C, and extension for 1 min at 
72 °C. Thirty-five cycles were run with the first denaturation and 
last extension times extended to 2 and 5 min, respectively. </p>

<p>Purified DNAs were directly sequenced on an ABI Prism TM 
377 DNA automatic DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, 
Foster City, CA, USA) using a BigDye™ cycle sequencing 
kit, v3.1 (Applied Biosystems). Primers were identical with 
those in ITS whereas LR0R, LR7 and the internal primer LR3 
(5' CCG TGT TTC AAG ACG GG 3') were used for amplification 
in LSU, respectively. </p>

<p>Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis </p>

<p>Sequences were edited with the <rs id="software-4" type="software">DNASTAR</rs> software, <rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">v5.0.5</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-4" type="creator">DNAstar</rs>, Madison, WI, USA). Alignment of the sequences 
was performed using <rs id="software-2" type="software">CLUSTAL_X</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Thompson et al.</rs>. <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-date">1997</rs>). 
Phylogenetic trees were obtained from the data using Bayesian 
modelling (MCMC). MCMC analysis was performed using Mr-
Bayes, v3.0b4 (Ronquist &amp; Huelsenbeck 2003). This program 
performs a Bayesian inference of the phylogeny, using Metro-
polis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses (Geyer 
1991). For a given dataset, the general time reversible (GTR) 
model was employed with gamma-distributed substitution 
rates. Markov chains were run for 10 6 generations, saving a </p>

<p>Abstract Seven species of Marasmius sect. Globulares with smooth pileipellis cells (sect. Globulares s. Singer) 
have been collected in the Republic of Korea (South Korea) to date, viz. M. aurantioferrugineus, M. brunneospermus, 
M. maximus, M. nivicola, M. purpureostriatus, M. wynneae and M. fusicystidiosus. Descriptions of their macro-and 
microscopic features with a discussion of similar taxa are given. Their taxonomic position was confirmed using DNA 
data. Marasmius fusicystidiosus is described as a new species. A key to aid in their identification is also provided. </p>

<p>Notes -Marasmius aurantioferrugineus is a very distinct 
species characterised by a large, orange-ferrugineous pileus, a 
rather long and wide stipe, large clavate, fusoid to sublacrimoid 
basidiospores, and the absence of pleurocystidia. </p>

<p>Among species with a similarly coloured pileus, M. heineman­ 
nianus, described from Africa, has larger cheilocystidia ((16-) 
22-61.5 × 6.2-12.5 μm) and well-developed pleurocystidia (An-
tonín 1998, 2007). Marasmius veigasii has lamellae and stipe 
concolorous with pileus, basidiospores c. 16 × 4 μm and absent </p>

<p>cystidia; M. pseudocollinus has a smaller, only 8-31 mm broad 
pileus, a smaller stipe (20-38 × 1.5-2.5(-4) mm), smaller ba-
sidiospores (6.5-7.5 × 3.3-3.5 μm) and absent cheilocystidia; 
M. silvicola has differently shaped and smaller basidiospores 
(4.5-8.3 × 2.5-4.2 μm; Desjardin et al. 2000 (5-)6-7 × 2-3.5 
μm) and present pleurocystidia (Singer 1976). </p>

<p>Marasmius aurantioferrugineus is only known from East Asia 
(China, Japan, and Republic of Korea) and the Russia Far East 
(Primorsky Territory; Bulakh &amp; Covorova 2000). </p>

<p>Notes -Marasmius brunneospermus is characterised by 
having moderately large basidiocarps with a pale coloured 
pileus, rather small basidiospores, well-developed cheilo-and 
pleurocystidia and a brown spore print. Our collections agree 
well with Takahashi's description and photos (Takahashi 1999) 
with the exceptions of the presence of pileocystidia and spore 
print colour. Pileocystidia are, however, scattered and indistinct 
in all specimens and may represent aberrant forms of pileipellis 
cells. Takahashi (1999) described and photographed a spore

<p>type specimen not only macro-and microscopically but also 
using molecular methods, the spore print colour described by 
Takahashi may be caused under the influence of growing condi-
tions of the fungi. The collection from the Hongreung Arboretum 
(KG 237) differs in having ellipsoid or fusoid-ellipsoid (never 
cylindrical or phaseoliform) basidiospores of the same size but 
different E (1.5 -2.1) and Q (1.9) ratio. However, this character 
falls within the variability of M. brunneospermus. </p>

<p>The presence of a brown spore print represents a unique char-
acter in Marasmius. Among other white-spored species with 
well-developed pleurocystidia and vestured stipe, M. silvicola, 
known from Argentina and Java, Indonesia, has a dark reddish 
orangish brown pileus when moist fading to brownish orange or 
brownish yellow and a more robust stipe, 80 -140 × 5 -10 μm 
(Desjardin et al. 2000); M. muramwyanensis, from Africa, has 
a membranaceous, centrally brown-beige and marginally beige 
or greyish orange pileus and smaller basidiospores, 5.0-6.2 
× 2.9 -3.7 μm (Antonín 2007). Marasmius lilacinus, from the 
USA, differs by having a lilaceous tinged pileus and different 
basidiospores (6.5 -8 × 4 -5 μm), while M. nigrodiscus, also 
from the USA, by differently shaped cheilocystidia, larger pleu-
rocystidia (45 -120 × 7-18 mm), and filamentous caulocystidia 
(Halling 1983). </p>

<p>Marasmius brunneospermus has been found only in East Asia 
(Japan, Takahashi 1999; Republic of Korea) to date. </p>

<p>Notes -Marasmius fusicystidiosus is a distinct species 
macroscopically similar to M. brunneospermus. It differs mainly 
by the size and shape of basidiospores and size of cheilo-
cystidia. </p>

<p>Among other species with well-developed pleurocystidia, 
Marasmius calvus, from Sri Lanka, has a centrally pale fawn 
and marginally fuscous brown pileus, narrower basidiospores 
(8 -10.5 × 2.7-3.5 μm) and cheilocystidia similar to pleuro-
cystidia (Pegler 1986, Desjardin et al. 2000); M. cystidiosus, 
known from the USA, has cheilocystidia that are of a different 
shape, similar to the pleurocystidia (Gilliam 1976, Halling 1983). 
Marasmius silvicola, known from several countries in South 
America and from Java, Indonesia, differs by smaller basidio-
spores ((5-)6-7 × 2-3.5 μm; Singer 1976: 4.5-8.3 × 2.5-4.2 
μm) and the presence of caulocystidia (Desjardin et al. 2000); 
M. goossensiae, from tropical Africa, differs by a cream col-
oured pileus with fuligineous or ochraceous brown centre 
and smaller basidiospores, 6.2-7.9(-9.2) × 3.5-4.2 μm; and 
M. muramwyanensis, also from tropical Africa, differs by smaller 
basidiospores (5.0-6.2 × 2.9-3.7 μm), differently shaped pleu-
rocystidia and the presence of caulocystidia (Antonín 2007). 
Marasmius phlebodiscus, described from Papua New Guinea, 
has a wrinkled pileus and smaller basidiospores, 5-6.5 × 3-3.5 
μm (Desjardin &amp; Horak 1997), and M. riparius, from Argentina, 
has a context with a slight unpleasant smell of rotten cabbage, 
broader basidiospores (8.2 -10 × 4.8 -5.5 μm) and smaller 
pleurocystidia (40-44 × 8-9 μm), that are similarly shaped to 
cheilocystidia (Singer 1976). </p>

<p>Notes -Marasmius maximus is a distinct species macro-
scopically similar to M. oreades. It differs by the character 
of the stipe vesture, size of basidiospores and presence of 
cheilocystidia. </p>

<p>Another species with developed cheilocystidia and a distinct 
stipe vesture, M. silvicola, known from Argentina and Java, 
Indonesia, has a dark reddish orangish brown pileus when 
moist, fading to brownish orange or brownish yellow, and 
smaller basidiospores, (5-)6-7 × 2-3.5 μm (Desjardin et al. 
2000; 4.5-8.3 × 2.5-4.2 μm according to Singer 1976). Mar­ 
asmius heinemannianus, described from Africa and having 
very similar basidiocarps, has a reddish brown pileus, larger 
basidiospores (10.8-14.5 × (4.2-)4.6-6.0(-6.6) μm), larger 
cheilocystidia ((16-)22-61.5 × 6.2-12.5 μm) and well-devel-
oped pleurocystidia (Antonín 1998, 2007). Among other African 
species, M. arborescens has a smaller, 10-20(-28) mm broad, 
white to whitish pileus, larger basidiospores ((6.9-)8-11.5 × 
3.0-4.0(-4.2) μm) and grows in dense fascicles. Marasmius 
lacteoides differs by a smaller, 8-30 mm broad, whitish yellow-
ish pileus and smaller basidiospores (6.3-8.5(-10) × 3.5-4.5 
mm); M. muramwyanensis by a membranaceous pileus, only 
up to 45 mm broad, smaller basidiospores (5.0-6.2 × 2.9-3.7 
μm) and the presence of well-developed pleurocystidia (An-
tonín 2007). </p>

<p>Marasmius maximus is only known from East Asia (Japan, 
Hongo 1962; Republic of Korea). </p>

<p>Notes -Marasmius purpureostriatus is a very distinct spe-
cies especially characterised by a striate pileus, glabrous stipe, 
large basidiospores and broadly clavate, fusoid, utriform, some-
times irregular cheilocystidia. </p>

<p>The most similar species is Marasmius pseudopurpureostriatus 
Wannathes et al., recently described from Thailand. It differs 
by having a larger pileus (14 -38 mm diam) with paler colours, 
a broader stipe (62 -80 × 1.5 -3 mm) and slightly smaller ba-
sidiospores (20 -25 × 5 -6.2 μm) with a mean length 22.8 μm 
(Wannathes et al. 2009b). However, our collection of M. pur­ 
pureostriatus has the same spore size, but our molecular stud-
ies proved that our collection belongs to this species. </p>

<p>Among other species with smooth pileus cells and striate pileus, 
M. viridis, from Papua New Guinea, differs by an olivaceous 
pileus, M. musisporus, also from Papua New Guinea, has a 
purplish lilac pileus with yellow striae, a reddish brown stipe 
and distinctly larger basidiospores, 30-40 × 4.5-5.0 μm in size 
(Desjardin &amp; Horak 1997). Marasmius ditopotramus, described 
from Bolivia, has a pileus and stipe without any purplish tinge 
and smaller basidiospores, 7-9 × 4.5 -4.8 μm (Singer 1976). 
The African species M. violaceoides has a violaceous, violet 
brown or brown pileus with pale violaceous striae, whitish 
to pale greyish orange lamellae, narrower basidiospores 
(15.5-22.3 × 3.3 -5.0 μm) and shorter cheilocystidia (14-24 
× (4.2 -)6.2 -9.2 μm). Other African species: M. zenkeri, has 
a pileus up to 100 mm broad, pale lilac lamellae, a robust 
((40-)120 -170 × 2 -12 mm) fuligineous, dark reddish brown 
or chestnut brown stipe, and large cheilocystidia (14 -50 × 
10-15 μm); M. bekolacongoli has yellow coloured or tinged 
pileus striae, yellow-white to pale lemon-yellow lamellae, a more </p>

<p>robust (50-150 × 2.5-6(-10) mm) stipe without purplish tinge 
and different basidiospores (17.5-24.5(-26) × (3.8-)4.2-5.4 
μm, Q = 5.1); M. brunneolus has a pileus without any purplish 
tinge, a more robust stipe (70-180 × 3-6 mm) also without any 
purplish tinge and slightly different basidiospores (15.5-25.5 × 
3.8-5.4 μm, Q = 4.4-4.6); and M. staudtii differs especially by 
having well-developed pleurocystidia (Antonín 2007). </p>

<p>Marasmius purpureostriatus has been collected in East Asia 
(Japan, Hongo 1958; Malaysia, Thailand, Tan et al. 2009, 
Wannathes et al. 2009a; Republic of Korea) and Papua New 
Guinea (Desjardin &amp; Horak 1997, Tan et al. 2009). </p>

violaceous, usually with paler margin, pallescent on drying, 
smooth, glabrous or rugulose to subsulcate in old specimens. 
Lamellae distant, L = 16-29, l = 2-3, free to emarginate with 
small decurrent tooth, segmentiform to ventricose, rather thick, 
intervenose when old, white to cream or grey, sometimes with

<p>Notes -Marasmius wynneae is characterised by a white, 
grey-ochraceous, milky white, grey, or grey-violaceous pileus 
and stipe, a mostly distinctly squamulose stipe, small basidio-
spores, and irregularly shaped cheilocystidia. The only known 
collection from the Republic of Korea was found in the HCCN 
herbarium (Suwon), which fully agrees with European material. 
For details about synonyms, name and taxonomy, see Antonín 
&amp; Noordeloos (2010). </p>

<p>Marasmius wynneae is a widely distributed species in Europe 
and has also been recorded from northern Africa (Malençon &amp; 
Bertault 1975). In East Asia, it is known only from the Republic 
of Korea. </p>

<p>Phylogenetic analysis </p>

<p>Based on nuclear ribosomal large subunit (LSU) and internal 
transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA sequences obtained in this 
study and from GenBank, the phylogenetic relationships of 
species in genus Marasmius sect. Globulares were inferred 
from MCMC analyses. LSU and ITS sequences were aligned 
and the ends trimmed to create a dataset of 760 and 651 base 
pairs, respectively. MrBayes was used to compute a 50 % 
majority rule consensus for 10 6 generations with a tree saved 
every 100th generation. The first 1 000 trees were discarded 
and the remaining trees obtained estimates for the posterior 
probabilities of group. The phylogenetic trees is shown in Fig. 9 
(LSU) and Fig. 10 (ITS). </p>



<p>Persoonia -Volume 24, 2010 </p>

<p>The circumscription of seven species based on morphological 
characteristics is concordant with those suggested by LSU 
and ITS sequences similarity. The new species Marasmius fusi­ 
cystidiosus forms a distinct branch sister of M. brunneospermus 
in the LSU and ITS rDNA analyses. Marasmius brunneospermus 
and M. nivicola specimens collected in Korea form monophyletic 
groups with the respective type specimens of M. brunneospermus 
(KPM-NC 0005011) and M. nivicola (KPM-NC 0006038). </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>Phylogenetic data inferred from LSU and ITS sequences sup-
port the recognition of species delimited by macro-and micro-
morphological characteristics. In this study, LSU and ITS rDNA 
sequences datasets aid in differentiating morphologically similar 
species. The result of this study are concordant with phylogenetic 
data of Marasmius in previous studies of Tan et al. (2009) and 
Wannathes et al. (2009a). </p>

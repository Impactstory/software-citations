<p>OBJECTIVE -To examine the effects of acute insulin-induced hypoglycemia on inflamma-
tion, endothelial dysfunction, and platelet activation in adults with and without type 1 diabetes. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -We studied 16 nondiabetic adults and 16 
subjects with type 1 diabetes during euglycemia (blood glucose 4.5 mmol/l) and hypoglycemia 
(blood glucose 2.5 mmol/l). Markers of inflammation, thrombosis, and endothelial dysfunction 
(soluble P-selectin, interleukin-6, von Willebrand factor [vWF], tissue plasminogen activator 
[tPA], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP], and soluble CD40 ligand [sCD40L]) were 
measured; platelet-monocyte aggregation and CD40 expression on monocytes were determined 
using flow cytometry. </p>

<p>RESULTS -In nondiabetic participants, platelet activation occurred after hypoglycemia, 
with increments in platelet-monocyte aggregation and P-selectin (P Յ 0.02). Inflammation was 
triggered with CD40 expression increasing maximally at 24 h (3.13 Ϯ 2.3% vs. 2.06 Ϯ 1.0%) 
after hypoglycemia (P ϭ 0.009). Both sCD40L and hsCRP (P ϭ 0.02) increased with a nonsig-
nificant rise in vWF and tPA, indicating a possible endothelial effect. A reduction in sCD40L, 
tPA, and P-selectin occurred during euglycemia (P ϭ 0.03, P Յ 0.006, and P ϭ 0.006, respec-
tively). In type 1 diabetes, both CD40 expression (5.54 Ϯ 4.4% vs. 3.65 Ϯ 1.8%; P ϭ 0.006) and 
plasma sCD40L concentrations increased during hypoglycemia (peak 3.41 Ϯ 3.2 vs. 2.85 Ϯ 2.8 
ng/ml; P ϭ 0.03). Platelet-monocyte aggregation also increased significantly at 24 h after hypo-
glycemia (P ϭ 0.03). A decline in vWF and P-selectin occurred during euglycemia (P Յ 0.04). </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS -Acute hypoglycemia may provoke upregulation and release of vasoac-
tive substances in adults with and without type 1 diabetes. This may be a putative mechanism for 
hypoglycemia-induced vascular injury. </p>

<p>A modified hyperinsulinemic glucose 
clamp (13) was used to maintain blood 
glucose at a predetermined level: euglyce-
mia at 4.5 mmol/l and hypoglycemia at 
2.5 mmol/l. Each subject underwent two 
laboratory sessions, separated by at least 2 
weeks (mean 7.2 weeks), of a euglycemic 
study and a hypoglycemic study in a ran-
domized, counterbalanced fashion. 
The participants with type 1 diabetes 
monitored blood glucose intensively dur-
ing the 48 h preceding each study, which 
was postponed if any blood glucose value 
was Ͻ3.5 mmol/l or if symptoms sugges-
tive of hypoglycemia were experienced. 
After fasting overnight, morning insulin 
was withheld. A retrograde-intravenous 
cannula for blood-glucose sampling was 
inserted into the nondominant hand, 
which was heated to arterialize the venous 
blood (14). A cannula in the nondomi-
nant antecubital fossa was used to infuse 
20% dextrose and soluble insulin (Hu-
man Actrapid; Novo Nordisk, Crawley, 
U.K.) at a constant rate of 1.5 mU/kg/min 
using a Gemini PCI pump (Alaris Medical 
Systems, San Diego, CA). The dextrose 
was infused at a variable rate depending 
on arterialized blood glucose concentra-
tions, which were measured at 5 min in-
tervals using the glucose oxidase method 
(2300 Stat; Yellow Springs Instruments, 
Yellow Springs, OH). A third cannula in 
the other antecubital fossa was dedicated 
to blood sampling for inflammatory 
markers. 
On each study day, the arterialized 
blood glucose was stabilized initially at 
4.5 mmol/l for 30 min and either main-
tained at that level (euglycemia) or low-
ered over 20 min to 2.5 mmol/l for 60 min 
(hypoglycemia), after which blood glu-
cose was restored to 4.5 mmol/l. Subjects 
consumed a standardized meal after each 
study. Blood sample time points were: 
baseline, during the experimental session 
(ϩ45 min), during recovery (ϩ105 min), 
at ϩ6 h, and at ϩ24 h. </p>

<p>Flow cytometry 
Whole blood samples were collected 
at the predetermined time points using 
D-Phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine chlo-
romethyl ketone, a selective thrombin in-
hibitor, as an anticoagulant. Samples (100 
l) of whole blood were immediately in-
cubated with 10 l of each monoclonal 
antibody (AbD Serotec, Kidlington, U.K.) 
for 30 min at room temperature, with 
subsequent red cell lysis by the addition 
of 1 ml of fluorescent-activated cell sorter 
(FACS) Lyse solution (Becton Dickinson, 
Oxford, U.K.). Flow cytometry using the 
FACS Calibur system (Becton Dickinson, 
Oxford, U.K.) was performed immedi-
ately after the experimental session to as-
sess platelet-monocyte aggregation 
(CD14/CD42a) and CD40 expression on 
monocytes (CD14/CD40). Isotype con-
trols were performed in addition to both 
mono-and dual-stain for each parameter 
assessed at each time point. </p>

<p>Soluble marker assays 
Citrated plasma and serum samples 
were collected at the predetermined 
time points. These were separated imme-
diately and frozen at Ϫ80°C until analysis 
for the soluble markers: 
Von Willebrand factor (vWF) (enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]; co-
efficient of variation [CV] 7.3%), tissue 
plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen (Hy-
phen Biomed Zymutest; intra-assay CV 
3.5%, inter-assay CV 4.4%), soluble 
CD40 ligand (sCD40L) (high sensitivity 
ELISA, Bender Medsystems; intra-assay 
CV 5.5%, inter-assay CV 7.2%), soluble 
P-selectin (ELISA, R&amp;D Systems; intra-
assay CV 5.1%, inter-assay CV 8.8%), 
IL-6 (High sensitivity ELISA, R&amp;D Sys-
tems; intra-assay CV 5.9%, inter-assay CV 
9.9%), and high sensitivity CRP (DRG Di-
agnostics; DRG Instruments, Marburg, 
Germany; intra-assay CV 4.2%, inter-
assay CV 4.1%). </p>

<p>Catecholamine assays 
Samples for epinephrine quantification 
were collected in EDTA tubes and imme-
diately separated and frozen at Ϫ80°C 
until analysis by high-performance liquid 
chromatography and electrochemical de-
tection (intra-assay CV 1.2%, inter-assay 
CV 3.9%). </p>

<p>Hypoglycemia symptom score 
The Edinburgh Hypoglycemia Scale (15)  was used to assess the symptoms experi-
enced during each experimental session. </p>

<p>Statistical analyses 
Results were analyzed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> version 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">15.0</rs> for Windows (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS</rs>, Chicago, IL). A 
general linear model (repeated-measures 
ANOVA) was used, with order of session 
(euglycemia-hypoglycemia or hypoglyce-
mia-euglycemia) as a between-subjects 
factor, and condition (euglycemia or hy-
poglycemia) as a within-subjects factor, to 
compare hypoglycemia with euglycemia. 
Additional analysis using paired t tests 
was performed to assess the change in any 
given parameter from baseline. A P value 
Ͻ0.05 was considered to be significant. 
Results are reported as mean Ϯ SD unless 
otherwise stated. </p>

<p>RESULTS -Hypoglycemia provoked 
a symptomatic response in all subjects 
with increased scores of autonomic (P Յ 
0.002), neuroglycopenic (P Ͻ 0.001), 
and malaise (P Յ 0.008) symptoms com-
pared with baseline. Comparison of base-
line levels of inflammatory, endothelial 
and platelet markers in nondiabetic sub-
jects and subjects with type 1 diabetes 
showed a significantly higher concentra-
tion of soluble P-selectin (P ϭ 0.01) and 
of CD40 expression on monocytes (P ϭ 
0.006) in those with diabetes, demon-
strating the chronic inflammatory re-
sponse associated with diabetes. </p>

<p>Blood glucose 
Target blood glucose concentrations were 
achieved (Fig. 1). In nondiabetic subjects, 
blood glucose concentrations were 
2.58 Ϯ 0.2 and 4.42 Ϯ 0.5 mmol/l during 
hypoglycemia and euglycemia, respec-
tively. In those with type 1 diabetes, blood 
glucose concentrations were 2.46 Ϯ 0.22 
and 4.53 Ϯ 0.24 mmol/l, respectively. 
The blood glucose nadir was similar in 
both groups. </p>

The epinephrine response occurred only 
during hypoglycemia and returned rap-
idly to baseline as anticipated (16). </p>

<p>Platelet activation 
Platelet-monocyte aggregation. In non-
diabetic subjects, platelet-monocyte ag-
gregation appeared to rise, from a baseline 
level of 0.72 Ϯ 0.8% to 3.09 Ϯ 8.1% 
during hypoglycemia, with a peak of 
3.49 Ϯ 10.4% at 24 h (Fig. 2). Platelet-
monocyte aggregation remained un-
changed throughout euglycemia. The 
difference between conditions, and 
from baseline, did not achieve statistical 
significance. 
In participants with diabetes, there 
was a late rise in platelet-monocyte aggre-
gation after hypoglycemia at 24 h com-
pared with baseline (P ϭ 0.03). 
Soluble P-selectin. Soluble plasma P-
selectin concentrations increased after 
hypoglycemia in nondiabetic subjects, 
exhibiting a late response at 6 h (P ϭ 
0.01) and 24 h (P ϭ 0.02; Fig. 2) but </p>

<p>decreasing during euglycemia (P ϭ 
0.006). 
P-selectin also decreased during eu-
glycemia in the diabetic group (P ϭ 0.04), 
but did not change during hypoglycemia. </p>

<p>Endothelial markers 
tPA. In nondiabetic subjects, plasma tPA 
concentrations increased during hypogly-
cemia, with a higher peak tPA concentra-
tion (12.55 Ϯ 16.7 compared with 
6.80 Ϯ 7.9 ng/ml) (NS between condi-
tions). Plasma tPA decreased significantly 
between baseline and test phase (P ϭ 
0.004) and recovery phase (P ϭ 0.006), 
with a paradoxical rise between baseline 
and 24 h (P ϭ 0.06) after euglycemia (Ta-
ble 2). However, a diurnal variation in tPA 
concentration is recognized to occur, 
which may account for the decline ob-
served during euglycemia (17). No signif-
icant differences occurred in the diabetic 
group (Table 2). 
vWF. A trend toward a difference in 
plasma vWF concentrations was observed 
between hypoglycemia and euglycemia at </p>

<p>6 h in the nondiabetic subjects (P ϭ 0.07) 
(Table 2). 
Plasma vWF concentrations de-
creased between baseline and test phase 
(P ϭ 0.02) and recovery phase (P ϭ 0.03) 
after euglycemia in the participants with 
diabetes. No such decrement was ob-
served during hypoglycemia (Table 2). </p>

<p>Inflammation 
CD40 expression. CD40 expression on 
monocytes increased after hypoglycemia 
in nondiabetic subjects, from a baseline of 
1.92 Ϯ 2.2% to a maximum of 3.13 Ϯ 
2.3% at 24 h (P ϭ 0.009). A significant 
difference between hypoglycemia and eu-
glycemia conditions was present at 6 h 
(P ϭ 0.05) and at 24 h (P ϭ 0.04) 
(Table 2). 
In participants with type 1 diabetes, 
monocyte CD40 expression increased 
from 3.69 Ϯ 3.4% to 5.54 Ϯ 4.4% during 
hypoglycemia (P ϭ 0.006), compared 
with no change during euglycemia 
(3.64 Ϯ 2.0% to 3.65 Ϯ 1.8%, respec-
tively; P ϭ NS). The increment during </p>

<p>
hypoglycemia had dissipated by the time 
of the recovery phase and remained un-
changed thereafter (Table 2). 
sCD40L. In nondiabetic subjects, 
plasma sCD40L concentrations were 
higher during hypoglycemia than during 
euglycemia (2.80 Ϯ 3.2 vs. 2.41 Ϯ 2.8 
ng/ml), with a trend toward significance 
(P ϭ 0.09). A significant reduction in 
sCD40L concentration occurred during 
euglycemia between baseline and recov-
ery phase (P ϭ 0.03) (Table 2). 
In those with diabetes, a significant 
difference was observed between the 
baseline levels on each study day: 3.36 Ϯ 
2.9 ng/ml on the hypoglycemia day com-
pared with 2.86 Ϯ 2.8 ng/ml on euglyce-
mia day (P ϭ 0.03), rendering subsequent 
measurements difficult to compare. A sig-
nificant difference was again observed be-
tween the experimental condition levels, 
with a level of 3.41 Ϯ 3.2 ng/ml during 
hypoglycemia and 2.85 Ϯ 2.8 ng/ml dur-
ing euglycemia (P ϭ 0.03) (Table 2). 
Changes from baseline did not achieve 
significance. 
IL-6. IL-6 levels rose in all experi-
ments, maximally at 6 h, irrespective of </p>

<p>condition, with no clear differences iden-
tifiable in either group between the study 
conditions (Table 2). 
hsCRP. Test phase hsCRP was higher 
in all subjects during hypoglycemia 
(1.81 Ϯ 1.9 vs. 1.22 Ϯ 1.9 ng/ml in non-
diabetic participants [P ϭ 0.02]; 2.72 Ϯ 
3.1 vs. 2.20 Ϯ 2.9 ng/ml in subjects with 
diabetes [P ϭ ns]) (Table 2). A significant 
difference was observed in the baseline 
concentrations in the nondiabetic partic-
ipants (P ϭ 0.01), frustrating interpreta-
tion of subsequent responses. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS -Previous studies 
have demonstrated that hypercoagulabil-
ity, platelet and neutrophil activation, C-
reactive protein, IL-6, and Endothelin-1 
are upregulated after acute hypoglycemia 
(3,6 -11), while a euglycemic insulin in-
fusion (for at least 2 h) was shown to re-
duce inflammatory markers, consistent 
with an anti-inflammatory effect of insu-
lin (18). The present study sought to 
replicate these effects, while investigat-
ing other underlying mechanisms of 
vascular disease, and tests were selected 
to investigate the effect of acute hypo-</p>

<p>glycemia on important cellular pro-
cesses (platelet activation, endothelial 
dysfunction and inflammation) under-
lying the development of acute and 
chronic vascular complications in type 
1 diabetes. 
The present study showed that hypo-
glycemia generated a response in some of 
these markers, suggesting that hypoglyce-
mia-induced metabolic stress may have 
adverse pathophysiological consequences 
while the euglycemic insulin infusion 
caused a potentially beneficial decrement 
in some parameters. However, the magni-
tude of most observed changes was small, 
and not all markers changed significantly. 
The present study confirmed that 
platelet activation is promoted by hypo-
glycemia (8), with increments both in 
platelet-monocyte aggregation and solu-
ble P-selectin. Conversely, P-selectin de-
creased during euglycemia. Endothelial 
function, using vWF and tPA Ag as surro-
gate markers, may have been disrupted, 
as shown by the increase in vWF after 
hypoglycemia in nondiabetic volunteers, 
but this change was not replicated in 
those with diabetes. However, a reduc-</p>

<p>tion in vWF occurred after euglycemia in 
diabetic participants, which should con-
fer vascular benefit. tPA Ag also appeared 
to increase in nondiabetic subjects during 
hypoglycemia, while declining during eu-
glycemia, whereas no significant changes 
occurred in the diabetic group. Soluble 
markers of inflammation, sCD40L and 
hsCRP, were higher during hypoglyce-
mia, with an elevation of hsCRP being ob-
served in all subjects. Unfortunately, 
baseline differences in hsCRP in nondia-
betic subjects, and in sCD40L in the dia-
betic subjects, frustrated interpretation of 
subsequent responses. sCD40L was ap-
parently reduced during euglycemia in 
nondiabetic participants. Surprisingly, 
IL-6 increased in all experiments regard-
less of glycemic status, with a maximal 
response at 6 h. This response is inexpli-
cable, and contrasts with a previous re-
port (10). Monocyte CD40 expression 
also increased, suggesting promotion of 
the interaction of the CD40-CD40 ligand 
dyad (from the tumor necrosis factor re-
ceptor family), thus affecting another 
process in the pathway leading to athero-
sclerotic plaque rupture (19,20). This 
change occurred much earlier in the dia-
betic than the nondiabetic subjects, in 
whom the response was delayed, pro-
longed, and still present at 24 h. The per-
sistence of these vascular changes for 24 h 
after the hypoglycemic stimulus, or their 
later emergence, suggests that the period 
of risk after hypoglycemia may be present 
long after blood glucose recovery. 
For some markers, a positive trend 
after hypoglycemia was evident, without 
achieving statistical significance, or the 
only measurable difference between con-
ditions was a beneficial effect associated 
with euglycemia. The sample size may 
have been insufficient to achieve signifi-
cance, particularly as the magnitude of re-
sponses was small. It was not feasible to 
study a larger number of subjects using a 
procedure that is labor-intensive and 
costly. In a previous study, larger incre-
ments in inflammatory markers were ob-
served during an insulin tolerance test, 
where hypoglycemia of Ͻ39 mg/dl (Ͻ2.2 
mmol/l) was induced (21). The more 
rapid reduction to a lower blood glucose 
causing a greater hypoglycemic stimulus 
may have heightened the magnitude of 
the responses, compared with the more 
modest changes that occurred during a 
controlled glucose clamp (blood glucose 
2.5 mmol/l [45 mg/dl]), as observed in 
the present study. A further limitation 
of the present study was the need to ex-</p>

amine the experimental conditions on two 
separate days in a counterbalanced fash-
ion. Because the baseline levels of many 
inflammatory markers can differ on sepa-
rate days, as was observed with sCD40L 
and hsCRP, this biological variability hin-
ders the interpretation and comparison of 
subsequent results. However, the present 
study design was necessary to allow com-
parison of the euglycemia and hypoglyce-
mia conditions in individual subjects, as 
both time and insulin infusion per se may 
exert effects on biomarker levels. This 
study design cannot control for other day-
to-day factors that could influence base-
line levels of inflammatory markers. 
However, the effects of hypoglycemia 
could be evaluated, as each participant 
acted as their own control. This produces 
less variability than a comparison of re-
sults among individuals, as more inter-
individual variation in inflammatory 
marker levels is present than intra-
individual variation. In addition, it was 
possible to analyze each study separately, 
by examining changes in parameters from 
baseline on that particular day, enabling 
the detection of significant effects exerted 
by hypoglycemia compared with euglyce-
mia. Baseline levels of all markers (except 
IL-6) were higher in the diabetic group 
(significant for P-selectin and CD40 ex-
pression). This could affect the magni-
tude of response induced by the 
experimental procedures. However, an 
analysis of the percentage change from 
baseline was consistent with the trends 
identified in the absolute results (shown 
as in the online appendix available at 
http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/ 
content/full/dc10-0013/DC1). 
As anticipated, epinephrine secre-
tion was stimulated by hypoglycemia. It 
is likely that hormonal changes underlie 
the activation and upregulation of the 
vascular biomarkers. Catecholamines 
promote platelet activation (22), while 
adrenoceptor blockade attenuates these 
effects (23,24). The participants with 
type 1 diabetes exhibited attenuated 
plasma epinephrine responses to hypo-
glycemia compared with the nondia-
betic subjects, who were naïve to such a 
hypoglycemic stimulus, this being con-
sistent with the recognized decline in 
the magnitude of counterregulatory 
hormonal responses with increasing 
duration of type 1 diabetes (25). This 
attenuated epinephrine response may 
explain the lower responses of vascular 
biomarkers to hypoglycemia. 
In summary, the effects of hypogly-</p>

<p>cemia on several vascular biomarkers 
that are implicated in the pathogenesis 
of vascular disease, would support the 
premise that acute hypoglycemia may 
be detrimental to an already diseased 
vasculature (2). Euglycemia may have a 
protective, anti-inflammatory effect. In 
the present study, the participants had 
no overt vascular disease and were un-
likely to develop any demonstrable ef-
fects from a short period of exposure to 
hypoglycemia. However, in people with 
diabetes of long duration, who are likely 
to have underlying vascular disease, 
these responses may not be benign. The 
release of potent vasoactive substances 
could potentially aggravate chronic vas-
culopathy, and contribute to the precip-
itation of acute macrovascular events. 
This may aggravate established diabetic 
micro-and macrovascular disease in 
those who are exposed to recurrent 
hypoglycemia. </p>

<p>Apneas and hypopneas associated with obstructive sleep apnea 
syndrome (OSAS) are due to recurrent upper airway obstruction 
during sleep. The cause of upper airway obstruction involves both 
anatomic factors and pharyngeal collapsibility. The syndrome is 
associated with loud snoring, sleep fragmentation and excessive 
daytime sleepiness. </p>

<p>It has been reported that 4% of men and 2% of women in the 
United States are affected by obstructive sleep apnea (1). The 
incidence is similar in Korea (2). 
It is well known that obesity is the most significant predispos-
ing factor for OSAS. Previous studies have found a close connec-
tion between obesity and OSAS (3, 4). One study reported that 
weight loss is related to increased upper airway cross-sectional 
area, which may improve apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) (5). 
Methods for viewing the obstructed area of the upper airway 
include cephalometry, computed tomography (CT), magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), nasopharyngoscope, fluoroscopy and 
electron beam tomography (EBT). These methods have their own 
advantages and disadvantages (6). Cephalometry is a useful tool 
to examine craniofacial and upper airway soft tissue morpholo-
gy in OSAS patients, but only produces static two-dimensional </p>

<p>Objectives. We investigated difference of parameters of polysomnography, cephalometry and dynamic multi-detector com-
puterized tomography (MD-CT) in wake and sleep states according to obesity. </p>

<p>Methods. We evaluated 93 patients who underwent polysomnography and cephalometry. MD-CT was performed in 68 
of these 93 patients. Fifty-nine and 34 patients were classified as obese and non-obese, with obesity defined as BMI 
≥25. Cephalometry results were analyzed for 12 variables. Using the MD-CT, we evaluated dynamic upper airway 
morphology in wake and sleep states and divided the upper airway into four parts named as high retropalatal (HRP), 
low retropalatal (LRP), high retroglossal (HRG), and low retroglossal (LRG). A minimal cross sectional area (mCSA) 
and collapsibility index (CI) were calculated for each airway level. </p>

<p>Results. Diastolic blood pressure (P=0.0005), neck circumference (P&lt;0.0001), and apnea-hypopnea index (P&lt;0.0001) were 
statistically significantly different between the obese and non-obese group. Among 12 cephalometric variables, there 
was a significant difference in only the distance from mandibular plane to hyoid bone (P=0.003). There was statistical 
difference in CI of HRG and LRG in sleep state (P=0.0449, 0.0281) but no difference in mCSA in wake and sleep states. </p>

<p>Conclusion. The obese group had more severe sleep apnea than the non-obese group. We believe that the increased sever-
ity of apnea in the obese group may be have been due to increased collapsibility of the upper airway rather than 
decreased size of the upper airway. </p>

<p>images. Several studies have compared obese and non-obese 
patients using cephalometry (7-11), but the usefulness of their 
results was limited as the upper airway changes dynamically 
during sleep. We previously reported that EBT and multi-detec-
tor computerized tomography (MD-CT) were useful methods for 
effectively viewing dynamic changes of the upper airway (12). 
The aim of this study was to identify the correlation between 
the obese and non-obese group by measuring apnea severity and 
anatomical features, using polysomnography, cephalometry, and 
dynamic MD-CT. </p>

<p>MATERIALS AND METHODS </p>

<p>Patients </p>

<p>Ninety-three OSAS patients who complained of snoring and sleep 
apnea were enrolled in this retrospective study. All subjects 
underwent both polysomnography and cephalometry and 68 
underwent MD-CT study. Body weight and height were record-
ed and the body mass index (BMI) was calculated as follows: 
BMI=weight (kg)/height (m) </p>

<p>2   . Based on the BMI value, the sub-
jects were classified into two groups: non-obese (BMI &lt;25, n=34) 
and obese (BMI ≥25, n=59). The patients who underwent MD-
CT (n=68) were also classified as obese (n=50) or non-obese (n=18). 
The obese group consisted of 51 men and 8 women, with a mean 
age of 45 years. The non-obese group consisted of 24 men and 
10 women, with a mean age of 41 years. </p>

<p>Polysomnography </p>

<p>One-night polysomnography (Beehive Millenium, Grass-Telefactor 
Inc., West Warwick, RI, USA) was performed in each patient 
and included electroencephalogram (EEG), bilateral electro-
occulogram (EOG), submental electromyogram (EMG), nasal 
and oral airflow, electrocardiogram (ECG), chest and abdomi-
nal respiratory effort using inductive plethysmography, and 
oxygen saturation by finger oximetry. Apnea was defined as 
cessation of oronasal airflow for more than 10 seconds. Hypopnea 
consisted of a more than 50% decrease in airflow and with at 
least 4% decrease in oxygen saturation. Severity of OSA was 
judged in terms of AHI. The AHI was defined by the frequency 
of apnea and hypopnea episodes per hour during the total sleep 
time. We diagnosed OSA in cases where AHI exceeded 5 per 
hour. </p>

<p>Cephalometry </p>

<p>A lateral cephalometric radiograph was obtained of each sub-
ject. Films were taken in a sitting position at a focus distance of 
70 inches. Exposures were made at 70 kv at the end-expiratory 
phase during quiet breathing using CX90SP (Ashahi, Tokyo, 
Japan). Twelve standard bony and soft-tissue measurements, 
commonly reported to show changes in OSAS, were obtained. 
First, the following measurements were made: distance from </p>

<p>mandibular plane to hyoid bone (MP-H), distance from velum 
tip to pharyngeal wall parallel to Frankfurt horizontal line (PAS), 
posterior nasal spine to velum tip-soft palate length (SPL), condyle 
to gnathion-total mandibular length (Man TL), gonion to gnathion-
mandibular body length (Man BL), and condyle to gonion-
mandibular ramus height (Man Ht). The soft palate-soft palate 
thickness (SPT, widest measurement), pharyngeal length (PhL), 
the smallest anteroposterior dimension of the retropalatal space 
(RP), and the retroglossal space (RG) were also gauged. Finally, 
the sella-nasion-supradentale (SNA) and sella-nasion-infraden-
tale (SNB) angles were measured. </p>

<p>Dynamic MD-CT </p>

<p>Scanning with MD-CT (Light speed ultra 16, GE medical sys-
tems, Milwaukee, WI, USA) was performed. First, the neck, des-
ignated from the hard palate to the epiglottis, was divided into 6 
to 8 levels depending on the patient's neck length. Scanning was 
repeated 25 times at each level with an interval of 0.3 seconds. 
The scan time for each image was 0.4 seconds. Thereafter, 
Dormicum 
� (midazolam 0.1 mg/kg, Rochu, Seoul, Korea) was 
intravenously injected and filming repeated as above when the 
patient was upon onset of snoring. 
The area from the hard palate to the tip of epiglottis of the 
upper airway was divided into two parts based on the end of 
the uvula and these two parts were subdivided into two equal 
parts; the resulting four areas were subsequently referred to as 
the high retropalatal (HRP), low retropalatal (LRP), high ret-</p>



<p>Fig. 1. Schematic lateral view of the upper airway. The site of obstruc-
tion is classified as one of four levels. The area from the inferior bor-
der of the hard palate to the inferior border of the uvula is classified 
as the retropalate level; the area from the inferior border of the uvula 
to the superior border of the epiglottis tip as the retroglossal level. Each 
of these two levels are further divided into 'high' and 'low' levels.

the computerized data obtained from MD-CT, the maximal and 
minimal cross sectional area (MCSA and mCSA) of each of these 
four areas was measured and the degree of movement of the 
upper airway according to respiration was calculated by the col-
lapsibility index [CI=(MCSA mCSA)/MCSA×100]. 
Changes of the cross sectional area of the upper airway were 
visualized by a newly developed computer program which drew 
a simulated diagram of the longitudinal view using cross-section-

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>The pathogenesis of OSA is known to be very complex and is 
not yet fully understood. The major pathophysiology is sleep-
related collapse of the upper airway (13), with anatomic factors 
and pharyngeal collapsibility known to play a part. 
Several methods have been employed to locate regions of upper 
airway obstrtuction: cephalometry, fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy, 
fluoroscopy, CT and MRI (6). Each of these methods has sever-
al disadvantages. Cephalometry produces only two-dimension-
al static images and allows anteroposterior dimension measure-
ment, but not lateral dimension measurement. While MRI can 
provide a cross-sectional image of organs, the required data 
acquisition time is long, with resultant motion artifacts due to </p>

<p>breathing and swallowing. Cephalometry, MRI and CT are per-
formed in the wake state. The meaningfulness of their results is 
therefore limited as the upper airway is known to change dynam-
ically during sleep. Fluoroscopy (14), EBT (15), and MD-CT (12), 
on the other hand, are used for dynamic radiographic examina-
tion of the upper airway. The disadvantages of fluoroscopy are 
that, as with cephalometry, the airway is shown in only two 
dimensions with measurement possible in the anteroposterior 
dimension, but not the lateral dimension. Furthermore, fluoro-
scopic examination leads to significant radiation exposure. In 
the case of EBT, Ye et al. (15) showed it to have the potential 
to provide information quickly and with no effect on upper 
airway dynamics. Comparing EBT and MD-CT, we previously 
reported that EBT and MD-CT were efficient modalities for 
dynamic upper airway mechanics, and that the results of MD-
CT were similar to those of EBT (12). Additionally, MD-CT had 
superior resolution and was less expensive in terms of mainte-
nance than EBT. 
Obesity is one of the most common predisposing factors in 
the development and progression of OSA. Previous studies 
have found a close connection between obesity and OSA (3, 4). 
Fat pads in the pharyngeal wall are increased in obese patients 
with OSA, causing narrowing of the pharyngeal lumen (16, 17). 
Static pharyngeal size modulated by dynamic loading of the 
airway due to the weight of fatty tissue of the neck may also 
contribute to the pathogenesis of OSA (18). One study reported 
weight loss to be related to increase in upper airway cross-sec-
tional area, and that this could improve AHI (5). Consistent with 
these results, the demographic data from our study shows that 
the obese group was more affected by OSA than the non-obese 
group. In another study, 50% of sleep apnea was accompanied </p>

<p>by hypertension (HTN), and 30% of HTN was associated with 
sleep apnea (19). We found positive association between obesi-
ty and hypertension and inferred that there was an interrela-
tionship between hypertension and sleep apnea. The NC was 
significantly associated with apnea and snoring (20), so larger 
neck circumference may be associated with greater severity of 
OSA. The NC of obese patients was statistically significant high-
er compared to non-obese patients in our study. In another study, 
the obese patients were shown to have higher AHI values, and 
a correlation between NC and AHI (21). Our results were con-
sistent with these findings. 
It was reported that in both non-obese and obese OSA patients, 
skeletal changes were often evident in cephalometric values (8). 
Displacement of the hyoid bone may contribute to the patho-
genesis of OSA (21). Ferguson et al. (11) found that increased 
MP-H is related to increased neck circumference. The hyoid 
bone is important as an anchorage for the tongue muscle, and 
increased MP-H distance is the result of increased soft tissue 
and fat deposition in the tongue. A previous study has reported 
that OSA patients showed a significant correlation between an 
increased MP-H distance and a higher AHI (22). However, anoth-
er study reported that the difference in the position of the hyoid 
bone in non-obese and obese OSA patients was not significant, 
and that in obese patients upper airway soft tissue enlargement 
may play a more important role in the development of obstruc-
tive sleep apnea, whereas in non-obese patients, bony structure 
discrepancies may be the dominant contributing factors for 
obstructive sleep apnea (10). In our study, inferior shift of the 
hyoid bone, reflected by increased MP-H, was significantly 
associated with obesity. This suggests that displacement of the 
hyoid bone may contribute to OSA. 
Two mechanisms for upper airway occlusion during sleep 
have been put forward: a neural hypothesis and an anatomic 
theory (23). The neural hypothesis involves decreased neural 
output to pharyngeal dilator muscles during sleep, leading to 
muscle hypotonia. The anatomic theory submits that upper air-
way collapsibility may be affected by soft tissue and body facial 
anatomy: fat deposits around the pharynx, hypertrophied ade-
noids and tonsils, macroglossia, retrognathia and micrognathia. 
Several studies using CT scanning have reported that upper air-
way collapse occurred at the oropharyngeal level, and that 
oropharyngeal narrowing at the level of the uvula, soft palate, 
and retrolingual space was the principle site of obstruction in 
OSA (24-26). Also, CT scanning during wakefulness may not 
predict the development of airway obstruction as the upper air-
way moves dynamically during respiration. In this study, the 
MD-CT was carried out in the wake and sleep states. We found 
that retroglossal area (HRG, LRG) in the obese group (wake or 
sleep states) was not narrower compared with that of the non-
obese group, suggesting that anatomical narrowing is not an 
important factor aggravating OSA in the obese group. However, 
the CI of HRG and LRG was significantly increased in the obese </p>

<p>group, suggesting that the neural hypothesis is a more important 
causative factor of OSA. 
Sexual differences may have affected these results. Among 
the 68 patients who underwent MD-CT, 57 were men, and 11 
were women. We therefore also compared the obese and non-
obese groups after excluding female patients. The resulting data 
(not shown) was similar to the data which included female patients 
(data not shown). 
The limitation of this study was the use of medications such 
as midazolam to induce sleep. Sleep inducing medications are 
known to influence upper airways physiologically and dynami-
cally (27). Furthermore, we were unable to observe the whole 
period of sleep. 
In conclusion, the obese group had more severe sleep apnea 
than the non-obese group. Furthermore, sleep apnea in obese 
patients may be aggravated by increased collapsibility of the 
upper airway rather than decreased size of the upper airway. </p>

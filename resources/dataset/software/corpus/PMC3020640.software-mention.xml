<p>Essential telomere 'capping' proteins act as a safeguard 
against ageing and cancer by inhibiting the DNA damage 
response (DDR) and regulating telomerase recruitment, 
thus distinguishing telomeres from double-strand breaks 
(DSBs). Uncapped telomeres and unrepaired DSBs can 
both stimulate a potent DDR, leading to cell cycle arrest 
and cell death. Using the cdc13-1 mutation to conditionally 
'uncap' telomeres in budding yeast, we show that the 
telomere capping protein Cdc13 protects telomeres from 
the activity of the helicase Pif1 and the exonuclease Exo1. 
Our data support a two-stage model for the DDR at 
uncapped telomeres; Pif1 and Exo1 resect telomeric DNA 
o5 kb from the chromosome end, stimulating weak </p>

<p>checkpoint activation; resection is extended 45 kb by 
Exo1 and full checkpoint activation occurs. Cdc13 is also 
crucial for telomerase recruitment. However, cells lacking 
Cdc13, Pif1 and Exo1, do not senesce and maintain their 
telomeres in a manner dependent upon telomerase, Ku 
and homologous recombination. Thus, attenuation of the 
DDR at uncapped telomeres can circumvent the need for 
otherwise-essential telomere capping proteins. 
Telomeres consist of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and 
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), bound by dsDNA-and 
ssDNA-binding proteins (Blackburn et al, 2006; Lydall,  2009). This nucleoprotein 'cap' has at least two functions: 
to shield the telomeric DNA from stimulating the DNA 
damage response (DDR) and to regulate elongation of </p>

<p>the telomere by telomerase. In human senescent cells, 
dysfunctional telomeres induce a sustained DDR (d'Adda di 
Fagagna et al, 2003). In both budding yeast and mice, nuclease 
activities that attack dysfunctional telomeres contribute to 
telomere-driven senescence (Maringele and Lydall, 2004;  Schaetzlein et al, 2007). Therefore, understanding the regula-
tion of nuclease activities at dysfunctional telomeres in yeast is 
likely to be informative about similar processes occurring at 
mammalian telomeres and the human ageing process. 
dsDNA-binding proteins and accessory factors are required 
at both human telomeres (TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, TPP1, RAP1) 
and budding yeast telomeres (Rap1, Rif1, Rif2) to prevent 
DDRs (Wotton and Shore, 1997; de Lange, 2005; Celli and  de Lange, 2005; Marcand et al, 2008; Bonetti et al, 2010;  Vodenicharov et al, 2010). In budding yeast, telomeric ssDNA 
is bound by Cdc13 with accessory proteins Stn1 and Ten1, 
whereas in human cells, it is bound by POT1 (de Lange, 2005;  Gao et al, 2007). Cdc13-Stn1-Ten1 forms an evolutionarily 
conserved complex (the CST complex) that has telomeric 
roles in most organisms studied so far (Miyake et al, 2009;  Surovtseva et al, 2009). POT1 binds telomeric ssDNA and is 
connected to the dsDNA-binding proteins of the telomere cap 
by TPP1 and TIN2 (de Lange, 2009). Inactivation of POT1 or 
Cdc13 induces 'telomere uncapping' and has similar conse-
quences-initiation of a DDR and resection of the telomeric 
DNA by nuclease activities (Garvik et al, 1995; Baumann and  Cech, 2001; Pitt and Cooper, 2010). 
The response to telomere uncapping is readily studied in 
budding yeast by inactivation of Cdc13 using the thermo-
sensitive allele cdc13-1 (Garvik et al, 1995). Following Cdc13 
inactivation, a potent DDR is initiated; telomeric DNA is 
resected by nucleases, which degrade the AC (5 
0 ) strand to 
generate extensive TG (3 
0 ) ssDNA that stimulates activation 
of the DNA damage checkpoint, in a manner analogous to 
that at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Figure 1A) (Garvik  et al, 1995; Lydall and Weinert, 1995; Vodenicharov and  Wellinger, 2006). There is relatively little understanding of 
the nuclease activities responsible for generating ssDNA at 
uncapped telomeres (Zubko et al, 2004). In contrast, there 
has been much recent progress identifying nuclease activities 
that function at DSBs (Gravel et al, 2008; Mimitou and  Symington, 2008; Zhu et al, 2008). 
Exo1 is the only nuclease known to generate ssDNA at 
uncapped telomeres in budding yeast (Maringele and Lydall,  2002). Exo1 is a 5 
0 to 3 
0 dsDNA exonuclease involved in DSB 
resection and in mismatch repair (Tsubouchi and Ogawa,  2000; Gravel et al, 2008; Mimitou and Symington, 2008;  Zhu et al, 2008). In the absence of Exo1, ssDNA is still 
generated following Cdc13 inactivation, demonstrating that </p>

<p>other nuclease activities must also function at uncapped 
telomeres. The determinant(s) of this Exo1-independent 
ssDNA generation have not so far been identified, but at 
least two hypothetical nuclease activities have been proposed 
(ExoX and ExoY) (Zubko et al, 2004). 
We sought to identify additional nuclease activities func-
tioning at uncapped telomeres following inactivation of 
Cdc13. Bioinformatic analysis of genetic interactions found 
the helicase Pif1 to be a candidate for contributing to nucle-
ase activity. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found 
that Pif1 and Exo1 are required for different nuclease acti-
vities that generate ssDNA and activate the DNA damage </p>

<p>that had similar genetic interactions to EXO1 (Figure 1B) (Stark  et al, 2006). Of these, 9/19 affected cdc13-1 growth or telomere 
length. Deletion of EXO1 suppresses cdc13-1 growth defects, 
so we focussed on those genes that also suppressed cdc13-1 
growth defects. By these criteria, two previously characterized 
checkpoint genes (RAD9 and RAD24) and the helicase-encod-
ing PIF1 behaved similarly to EXO1 (Figure 1B). Rad9 and 
Rad24 do indeed regulate nuclease activities at uncapped 
telomeres and are required for checkpoint activation (Garvik  et al, 1995; Lydall and Weinert, 1995; Zubko et al, 2004). 
Pif1 has been shown to inhibit growth of cdc13-1 mutants 
(Downey et al, 2006), whereas overexpression of Pif1 has been 
shown to enhance growth defects seen in cdc13-1 mutants, but 
the contribution of Pif1 to the nuclease activity and check-
point activation in cdc13-1 mutants had not been assessed 
(Vega et al, 2007; Chang et al, 2009). 
Pif1 is a helicase with both mitochondrial and nuclear 
functions (Van Dyck et al, 1992; Schulz and Zakian, 1994). In 
the nucleus, Pif1 has been implicated in negative regulation 
of telomerase, generation of long flaps during Okazaki frag-
ment processing, unwinding of G-quadruplexes and disas-
sembly of stalled replication forks (Zhou et al, 2000; Boule  et al, 2005; Budd et al, 2006; Chang et al, 2009; George et al,  2009; Makovets and Blackburn, 2009; Pike et al, 2009;  Ribeyre et al, 2009; Zhang and Durocher, 2010). To test the 
hypothesis that Pif1 contributes to a nuclease activity at 
uncapped telomeres in cdc13-1 mutants, we compared the 
effects of Pif1 and Exo1 on cell growth after Cdc13-1 inactiva-
tion. At the permissive temperature (231C), Cdc13-1 is func-
tional and efficiently caps the telomeres, permitting growth of 
cdc13-1 mutants. At the non-permissive temperature (361C), 
Cdc13-1 is completely defective and cdc13-1 mutants are 
unable to grow (Figure 1A and C). At semi-permissive 
temperatures (25-291C), moderate Cdc13-1 inactivation oc-
curs and growth of cdc13-1 mutants is inhibited (Figure 1C). 
As previously reported, cdc13-1 pif1D and cdc13-1 exo1D 
mutants are able to grow at 271C, whereas cdc13-1 mutants 
are not (Figure 1C) (Zubko et al, 2004; Downey et al, 2006). 
These effects on growth are consistent with the hypothesis 
that Pif1, like Exo1, contributes to nuclease activity at 
uncapped telomeres. 
Pif1 and Exo1 inhibit growth of cdc13-1 mutants, possibly 
by contributing to nuclease activity at uncapped telomeres. 
To test whether the two proteins worked in the same path-
way/complex or in different pathways, we examined the 
effect Pif1 on growth of cdc13-1 exo1D mutants. cdc13-1 
exo1D mutants were unable to grow at 301C, whereas 
cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants were able to grow at 30 and 
361C (Figure 1C). Remarkably, at 361C, the growth of cdc13-1 
exo1D pif1D mutants was barely distinguishable from that of 
CDC13 
þ exo1D pif1D mutants (Supplementary Figure S1A). </p>

<p>We confirmed that this effect was due to the pif1D and exo1D 
mutations and not due to second site suppressors arising in 
our strains by crossing a cdc13-1 mutant able to grow at 361C, 
with a cdc13-1 strain and confirming that all cdc13-1 exo1D 
pif1D progeny could all grow at 361C (Supplementary Figure 
S1B). We conclude that Pif1 and Exo1 inhibit growth of 
cdc13-1 mutants through different pathways, and inacti-
vation of these pathways may eliminate the requirement for 
telomere capping by Cdc13. 
At DSBs, parallel nuclease activities dependent upon Exo1, 
the helicase Sgs1 and nuclease Dna2 generate extensive </p>

<p>ssDNA (Gravel et al, 2008; Mimitou and Symington, 2008;  Zhu et al, 2008). We hypothesized that, as with Exo1, 
elimination of Sgs1 or Dna2 in cells lacking Pif1 might 
improve the growth of cdc13-1 mutants and perhaps even 
permit growth at 361C. However, we found that cdc13-1 pif1D 
dna2D mutants grew less well than cdc13-1 pif1D mutants 
(Supplementary Figure S2A). We were unable to examine the 
effect of dna2D on the growth of cdc13-1 PIF1 
þ mutants, as </p>

<p>DNA2 is an essential gene unless PIF1 is deleted (Budd et al,  2006). We also found that cdc13-1 pif1D sgs1D mutants grew 
slightly less well than cdc13-1 pif1D mutants and that cdc13-1 
sgs1D mutants grew slightly less well than cdc13-1 mutants 
(Supplementary Figure S2B), consistent with other work 
from our laboratory (Ngo and Lydall, 2010). We conclude 
that Exo1 inhibits the growth of cdc13-1 mutants with un-
capped telomeres, whereas Sgs1 and Dna2 contribute to the 
vitality of such cells. Therefore, we chose to focus on the 
roles of Pif1 and Exo1 at uncapped telomeres. </p>

<p>Elimination of Pif1 and Exo1 permits telomere 
maintenance following inactivation of Cdc13 
Yeast cells can overcome the requirement for Cdc13 by 
altering telomere structure, as observed in rare variants, 
which can be selected for after inactivation of telomerase or 
after attenuation of nuclease/checkpoint activities at un-
capped telomeres (Larrivee and Wellinger, 2006; Zubko and  Lydall, 2006). To test whether elimination of Pif1 and Exo1 
caused alterations in telomere structure that could explain the 
growth of cdc13-1 cells at 361C, we performed Southern blots 
to examine telomere structure, probing for Y 
0 sequences 
(Figure 2B), which are components of the majority of yeast 
telomeres (Supplementary Figure S3A and B). The Y 
0 probe 
contained G-rich sequences and weakly cross-hybridized to 
telomeres that did not contain Y 
0 sequences, so we also 
probed for TG repeat sequences to detect telomeres that 
lacked Y 
0 elements (Supplementary Figure S4).

<p>(compare lanes 1-2, 3-4 and 7-8; Figure 2B). The telomeres

than those of CDC13 
þ exo1D pif1D mutants grown at 231C </p>

<p>(compare lanes 9-10 with lanes 7-8, Figure 2B) but indis-
tinguishable from those of cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants 
grown at 231C (compare lanes 9-10 with lanes 17-18, 
Figure 2B). This demonstrates that no gross alterations in 
telomere structure occur when cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants 
are grown at 361C. Furthermore, cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants 
are able to grow at 361C, whereas cdc13-1 pif1D mutants are 
not, but are indistinguishable in telomere structure (compare 
lanes 13-14 with lanes 17-18, Figure 2B). We conclude that 
alterations in telomere structure most likely do not account 
for the growth of cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants at 361C. 
Pif1 exists as both nuclear and mitochondrial isoforms 
(Schulz and Zakian, 1994). Therefore, we wanted to know 
whether the nuclear or mitochondrial function of Pif1 inhibited 
growth of cdc13-1 exo1D mutants at 361C. The pif1-m2 allele, 
lacking nuclear Pif1, permitted growth of cdc13-1 exo1D 
mutants at 361C, whereas the pif1-m1 allele, lacking mitochon-
drial Pif1, did not (Figure 2C). We note that the growth of 
cdc13-1 exo1D pif1-m2 mutants at 361C is less than cdc13-1 
exo1D pif1D mutants (Figure 2C). This is consistent with other </p>

<p>reports that low levels of nuclear Pif1 activity persist in pif1-m2 
mutants (Schulz and Zakian, 1994; Ribeyre et al, 2009). We 
also confirmed that helicase activity of Pif1 inhibited growth of 
cdc13-1 exo1D mutants because the pif1-hd allele, deficient 
in helicase activity, also permitted growth at 361C (Figure 2C) 
(Zhou et al, 2000; Ribeyre et al, 2009). We conclude that 
nuclear, helicase-dependent activity of Pif1 inhibits growth of 
telomere capping-defective cdc13-1 mutants. </p>

role of Pif1 in cell cycle arrest, cdc13-1 mutants were syn-
chronized in G1 using a factor at 231C, then released to 361C 
to assess metaphase arrest (Figure 3A). All strains also 
harboured the cdc15-2 mutation so that any cells that over-
came cdc13-1-induced metaphase arrest would arrest in late 
anaphase due to cdc15-2 and be unable to enter another cell 
cycle (Figure 3A) (Lydall and Weinert, 1995; Zubko et al,  2004). As expected, cdc13-1 mutants accumulated at meta-
phase and did not pass through to anaphase (Figure 3B and C). 
cdc13-1 exo1D mutants accumulated at metaphase with simi-

<p>arrest and accumulated in late anaphase due to the cdc15-2 
mutation (Figure 3B and C) (Zubko et al, 2004). cdc13-1 pif1D 
mutants behaved like cdc13-1 mutants and did not pass 
through to anaphase (Figure 3B and C). Interestingly, cdc13-
1 exo1D pif1D mutants did not accumulate in metaphase at all 
and passed readily through to anaphase (Figure 3B and C). 
Taken together, these results show that Pif1 has no effect on 
metaphase arrest of cdc13-1 mutants at 361C when Exo1 is 
present, but it is responsible for the arrest of a subpopulation 
of cells when Exo1 is absent. 
Following inactivation of Cdc13, Mec1-dependent check-
point activation occurs, leading to activation and hyperphos-
phorylaiton of the kinase Rad53 (Figure 1A) (Sweeney  et al, 2005; Morin et al, 2008). We used the synchronous 
cultures to examine Rad53 phosphorylation by western blot 
(Figure 3A). cdc13-1 and cdc13-1 pif1D mutants exhibited 
strong Rad53 phosphorylation, indicated by a marked 
upward mobility shift of Rad53 (upper panels, Figure 3D). 
A reduction in Rad53 phosphorylation was seen in cdc13-1 
exo1D mutants, correlating with the recovery from metaphase 
arrest displayed by cdc13-1 exo1D mutants following telomere 
uncapping (Figure 3C and D). Interestingly, no discernable 
change in the mobility of Rad53 could be seen in cdc13-1 
exo1D pif1D mutants, consistent with their complete 
failure to arrest cell division at 361C (Figure 3C and D). We 
conclude that in the absence of Pif1 and Exo1, the checkpoint </p>

<p>kinase Rad53 is not activated after telomere uncapping in 
cdc13-1 mutants. 
To see whether cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D strains were defective 
in the DDR after other types of DNA damage as well as after 
telomere uncapping, we treated cells with bleomycin to 
induce DSBs. At both DSBs and uncapped telomeres, 
ssDNA is an important stimulus for the Mec1-dependent 
checkpoint. We treated the same set of strains examined in 
Figure 3B-D, with bleomycin at 231C after release from G1 
arrest. cdc13-1, cdc13-1 pif1D, cdc13-1 exo1D and cdc13-1 
exo1D pif1D mutants all behaved similarly, phosphorylating 
Rad53 and arresting at methaphase (Figure 3E; 
Supplementary Figure S4). We conclude that a functional 
DDR pathway operates in (cdc13-1) exo1D pif1D cells but that 
these cells are specifically defective in responding to telomere 
uncapping. 
Telomeric ssDNA stimulates metaphase arrest following 
telomere uncapping (Garvik et al, 1995). We used synchro-
nous cultures (Figure 3A) and quantitative amplification 
of ssDNA (QAOS) to measure subtelomeric ssDNA in repeti-
tive Y 
0 elements (present on Chromosome V and most other 
chromosome ends) following Cdc13 inactivation (Figure 4A) 
(Booth et al, 2001). cdc13-1 mutants with uncapped telo-
meres generated ssDNA at both the Y 
0 600 and Y 
0 5000 loci 
(Figure 4B and C). cdc13-1 exo1D mutants generated 
less ssDNA following telomere uncapping at the Y 
0 loci, as </p>

<p>previously reported (Maringele and Lydall, 2002; Zubko et al,  2004). Interestingly, cdc13-1 pif1D mutants, like cdc13-1 
exo1D mutants showed reduced ssDNA generation in the 
Y 
0 600 and Y 
0 5000 loci following telomere uncapping. 
Furthermore, cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants generated no 
detectable ssDNA at Y 
0 600 or Y 
0 5000 loci following telomere 
uncapping (Figure 4B and C). We confirmed that ssDNA 
generation occurred on the TG (3 
0 ) strand due to degradation 
of the AC (5 
0 ) strand, as we were unable to detect ssDNA </p>

<p>on the AC strand (Figure 4D). We conclude that Pif1, like 
Exo1, is important for ssDNA generation after telomere 
uncapping in cdc13-1 mutants and appears to regulate a 
nuclease activity, which functions in parallel to Exo1 at 
chromosome ends. 
To examine how Pif1 and Exo1 affect ssDNA accumulation 
further from chromosome ends, we measured ssDNA at single-
copy loci on Chromosome V after Cdc13 inactivation. At 4 h, 
cdc13-1 mutants generated ssDNA at all loci examined, with </p>

<p>repeats and no ssDNA in single-copy loci on Chromosome V, 
also as previously reported (Figure 4E) (Zubko et al, 2004). 
cdc13-1 pif1D mutants generated similar amounts of ssDNA to 
cdc13-1 exo1D mutants in the Y 
0 repeats. However, at more 
distal, single-copy loci, cdc13-1 pif1D mutants generated less 
ssDNA than cdc13-1 mutants but more than exo1D cdc13-1 
mutants. The higher levels of ssDNA generated further from 
the chromosome end in cdc13-1 pif1D mutants, in comparison 
with cdc13-1 exo1D mutants, most likely accounts for their 
sustained metaphase arrest following telomere uncapping 
(Figure 3B and C). Furthermore, the ssDNA generated by 
cdc13-1 and cdc13-1 pif1D mutants o10 kb from the chromo-
some end is 41.6% (1/64) (Figure 4E). Assuming 1 single-
stranded telomere per cell is sufficient to stimulate arrest, this 
suggests that ssDNA extending o10 kb on one of the 64 G2 
telomeres in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is sufficient to stimulate 
metaphase arrest (Figure 4E) (Sandell and Zakian, 1993; Vaze  et al, 2002; Zubko et al, 2004). 
No checkpoint activation was detected in cdc13-1 exo1D 
pif1D mutants following telomere uncapping, and no ssDNA 
was detected in the Y 
0 elements (Figures 3D and 4B). However, 
yku70D mutants at 231C have detectable ssDNA in the telo-
meric TG repeats but do not undergo checkpoint activation 
(Gravel et al, 1998; Polotnianka et al, 1998; Maringele and  Lydall, 2002). Thus, we hypothesized that cdc13-1 exo1D 
pif1D mutants might still generate detectable ssDNA in the 
TG repeats. We used synchronous cultures (Figure 3A) and 
measured ssDNA by in-gel assay to measure ssDNA in the TG 
repeats in cdc13-1 mutants (Figure 4F and G). cdc13-1 mutants 
generated large amounts of TG ssDNA at 2 and 4 h following 
telomere uncapping (Figure 4F), corresponding to an approxi-
mately five-fold increase in signal compared with yku70D 
mutants (Figure 4G). cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants also gen-
erated detectable ssDNA 2 h following telomere uncapping, 
but at a level approximately equal to that of a yku70D mutant 
(Figure 4F and G). However, the ssDNA generated in cdc13-1 
exo1D pif1D mutants was transient and was no longer detect-
able 4 h after telomere uncapping (Figure 4F and G). 
Surprisingly, cdc13-1 pif1D mutants displayed only a modest 
decrease in ssDNA generation in the TG repeats following 
telomere uncapping, whereas cdc13-1 exo1D mutants gener-
ated very little ssDNA (Figure 4F and G). We conclude that 
cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants generate limited, transient 
ssDNA that is insufficient to stimulate checkpoint activation 
and that Exo1 is much more important than Pif1 for ssDNA 
generation in the TG repeats following telomere uncapping. </p>

<p>Pif1 has important functions in cells lacking telomerase 
It has been suggested that increased levels of telomerase at 
the telomeres of cdc13-1 pif1D cells shields uncapped telo-
meres from nuclease activities (Vega et al, 2007). However, 
this is somewhat inconsistent with our observation that Pif1 
has relatively little effect on ssDNA generation in the telo-
meric TG repeats, where telomerase presumably binds 
(Figure 4G). Therefore, we wanted to know whether the 
ability of the pif1D mutation to improve the growth of 
cdc13-1 mutants was dependent upon the telomerase tem-
plate component (TLC1) or catalytic subunit (Est2). 
Interestingly, we found that cdc13-1 tlc1D pif1D and cdc13-1 </p>

<p>tlc1D exo1D mutants grew better at 251C than cdc13-1 tlc1D 
mutants (compare rows 7-8 and 11-12 with 3-4, Figure 5A; 
Supplementary Figure S6). We also found that cdc13-1 
est2D pif1D and cdc13-1 est2D exo1D mutants were able to 
grow at 251C, whereas cdc13-1 est2D mutants were not 
(Supplementary Figure S7). We conclude that Pif1 has a 
telomerase (TLC1, Est2) independent effect at uncapped 
telomeres. However, we note that est2D cdc13-1 and tlc1D 
cdc13-1 mutants grow worse than cdc13-1 mutants, demon-
strating that telomerase contributes to telomere capping 
following inactivation of Cdc13. 
Pif1 is responsible for the residual checkpoint activation in 
cdc13-1 exo1D mutants (Figure 3D) and inhibits growth of 
cdc13-1 mutants lacking telomerase (Figure 5A). We hypothe-
sized that Pif1 would contribute to ssDNA generation at 
uncapped telomeres and subsequent checkpoint activation, 
even in cdc13-1 mutants lacking telomerase. To test this, we 
measured Rad53 phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure 
S8A) and telomeric TG repeat ssDNA (Supplementary 
Figure S8B and C) in cdc13-1 and cdc13-1 tlc1D mutants, 
before and after telomere uncapping. In cdc13-1 tlc1D exo1D 
pif1D mutants, there was a decrease in Rad53 phosphoryla-
tion compared with cdc13-1 tlc1D exo1D mutants 
(Supplementary Figure S8A). We also found that cdc13-1 
tlc1D pif1D and cdc13-1 tlc1D exo1D pif1D mutants generated 
less ssDNA than cdc13-1 tlc1D and cdc13-1 tlc1D exo1D 
mutants, respectively, following telomere uncapping 
(Supplementary Figure S8B and C). We conclude that Pif1 
has a contribution to ssDNA generation and checkpoint 
activation following telomere uncapping that is independent 
of telomerase. However, we note that 40% of cdc13-1 tlc1D 
cells were at metaphase at 231C compared with 30% of 
cdc13-1 tlc1D pif1D cells (Supplementary Figure S8D). Thus, 
we cannot exclude the possibility that reduced ssDNA gen-
eration in cdc13-1 tlc1D pif1D mutants is due to altered 
kinetics of accumulation at metaphase. 
Although Pif1 clearly demonstrates a telomerase-indepen-
dent effect in cdc13-1 mutants, we note that cdc13-1 tlc1D 
exo1D mutants could grow at 271C, whereas cdc13-1 tlc1D 
pif1D mutants could not (compare rows 11-12 with 7-8, 
Figure 5A). In contrast, cdc13-1 TLC1 
þ exo1D mutants and </p>

<p>cdc13-1 TLC1 
þ pif1D mutants could both grow similarly at </p>

<p>271C (compare rows 9-10 with 5-6, Figure 5A). This shows 
that Pif1 is less potent than Exo1 at inhibiting growth of 
cdc13-1 tlc1D mutants than cdc13-1 TLC1 
þ mutants. </p>

<p>To help clarify the role of Pif1 in cdc13-1 tlc1D and cdc13-1 
TLC1 
þ mutants, we examined the effect of Pif1 in CDC13 </p>

<p>þ </p>

<p>tlc1D mutants. Yeast strains that cannot recruit telomerase 
(e.g. tlc1D) lose telomeric DNA with each cell division until 
the cultures senesce and lose proliferative capacity, much like 
mammalian fibroblasts. Senescent, telomerase-deficient 
yeast cultures usually recover, using telomerase-independent, 
recombination-dependent mechanisms of telomere mainte-
nance, leading to clear changes in telomere structure 
(Lundblad and Blackburn, 1993; Teng and Zakian, 1999). 
Therefore, we germinated spores containing combinations 
of null mutations in telomerase (TLC1), PIF1 and EXO1, 
and assessed growth at various passages (Figure 5B). As 
expected, tlc1D mutants grew well at passage 1, poorly from 
passages 2-5 (senescence) and grew well again from passage 
7 (recovery) (Figure 5B). tlc1D exo1D mutants showed a 
similar pattern of growth to tlc1D mutants but grew slightly </p>

<p>better prior to senescence, as previously reported (passages 3 
and 4, Figure 5B) (Maringele and Lydall, 2004). In contrast, 
tlc1D pif1D and tlc1D pif1D exo1D strains showed a rapid 
decline in growth from passages 2-6 (senescence) and 
exhibited a protracted senescence period but slowly recovered 
by passage 15 (Figure 5B). We conclude that Pif1 inhibits 
entry into senescence and promotes recovery. Taken with the 
data discussed earlier, Pif1 contributes to good growth of tlc1D </p>

<p>mutants from passage 2 onwards, yet inhibits growth of 
cdc13-1 mutants (Figures 1C and 5A). In contrast, Exo1 has 
only a small effect on the growth of tlc1D mutants, yet inhibits 
growth of cdc13-1 mutants (Figures 1C and 5A). Thus, it is 
likely that the relatively poor growth of cdc13-1 tlc1D 
pif1D compared with cdc13-1 tlc1D exo1D mutants is due to 
the poor growth of tlc1D pif1D mutants compared with tlc1D 
exo1D mutants. </p>

<p>After long cultivation (passage 15, 45 days growth) tlc1D 
pif1D and tlc1D pif1D exo1D mutants could be distinguished 
from those of tlc1D and tlc1D exo1D mutants by their poor 
growth (Figure 5B). Telomerase-deficient survivors typically 
show clear alterations in telomere structure-type I survivors 
undergo dramatic amplification of Y 
0 elements and retain 
short TG overhangs, whereas type II survivors show modest 
amplification of Y 
0 elements but amplify their TG overhangs 
(Teng and Zakian, 1999). Therefore, we examined the telo-
meres of tlc1D pif1D and tlc1D pif1D exo1D mutants. At 
passage 1, before entry into senescence, tlc1D, tlc1D exo1D, 
tlc1D pif1D and tlc1D pif1D exo1D mutants all had short 
telomeres (compare lanes 1-4 with lanes 5-12, Figure 5C). 
At passage 15, tlc1D mutants and tlc1D exo1D mutants had 
amplified Y 
0 elements and terminal fragments to generate 
type II (lanes 17-18, Figure 5D) or type I (lanes 21-22, 
Figure 5D) survivors. In contrast, tlc1D pif1D and tlc1D 
pif1D exo1D mutants at passage 15 had shorter telomeres 
than at passage 1 and had undergone a reduction in Y </p>

<p>0 </p>

<p>elements, but did not appear to have generated type I or 
type II survivor telomere structures (compare lanes 7-8 with 
19-20 and lanes 11-12 with 23-24, Figure 5D). We noted that 
tlc1D pif1D and tlc1D pif1D exo1D mutants resembled type I 
survivors in that our TG probe did not detect any individual 
telomeres further up the gel (marked with arrows, compare 
lanes 7-8 with 19-20 and lanes 11-12 with 23-24, 
Supplementary Figure S10), indicating that all telomeres in 
these strains had acquired a terminal Y 
0 fragment. However, 
the terminal fragments of tlc1D pif1D and tlc1D pif1D exo1D 
were even shorter than those of type I survivors and they had </p>

<p>undergone a reduction, not an amplification in Y 
0 elements, 
clearly distinguishing them from typical type I survivors 
(compares lanes 19-20, 23-24 with lanes 21-22, Figure 5D). 
We conclude that Pif1 is required for the generation of type I 
and type II survivors and that in the absence of Pif1, cells 
lacking telomerase can improve growth following senescence 
without adopting typical type I or type II survivor structures. </p>

<p>Telomerase is crucial for survival in the absence 
of Cdc13 
Cdc13 has two crucial functions at telomeres-one, to shield 
telomeres from nuclease activities and the second to recruit 
telomerase to the telomere (Nugent et al, 1996). Although 
elimination of Pif1 and Exo1 permits cdc13-1 mutants to grow 
at 361C (presumably when cdc13-1 is completely inactivated), 
this does not permit cdc13-1 tlc1D mutants to grow at 361C 
(compare rows 13-14 with 15-16, Figure 5A), demonstrating 
that telomerase has a function in cdc13-1 mutants at 361C. 
Therefore, we hypothesized that at 361C, Cdc13-1 might 
retain the ability to recruit telomerase, and Cdc13-dependent 
telomerase activity might be essential for growth. 
Alternatively, telomerase might be recruited to telomeres in 
a Cdc13-independent manner. 
To test whether Cdc13-1 retained the ability to recruit 
telomerase in cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D cells at 361C, we decided 
to delete CDC13. We generated diploid strains heterozygous 
for pif1D, exo1D and cdc13D mutations. Diploids were sporu-
lated, tetrads dissected and vegetative cells containing com-
binations of the three deletion mutations were allowed to 
form colonies. Figure 6A shows a representative image of one </p>

exo1D pif1D strains were viable and had a germination 
efficiency of B90% compared with CDC13 exo1D pif1D 
strains (Figure 6A; Supplementary Table SI). However, it 
was clear that cdc13D exo1D pif1D mutants grew less well 
than CDC13

<p>plates (Figure 6A). No viable colonies were formed from

þ or EXO1 
þ . We conclude </p>

<p>that neither Cdc13-dependent telomerase activity nor 
Cdc13-dependent capping activities are required for growth 
following elimination of Pif1 and Exo1. 
The viability of cdc13D exo1D pif1D strains was surprising 
in the light of the requirement for telomerase in cdc13-1 
exo1D pif1D strains. We hypothesized that Cdc13-indepen-
dent telomerase activity was essential for the viability of 
cdc13D exo1D pif1D strains. To test this, we generated diploid 
strains heterozygous for pif1D, exo1D, cdc13D and tlc1D 
mutations, containing a plasmid that carried a wild-type 
copy of CDC13. Diploids were sporulated and tetrad dissec-
tion was performed to generate strains containing combina-
tions of the four deletion mutations, in addition to the wild-
type copy of CDC13. These strains were diluted across agar 
plates either fully supplemented (YEPD), lacking uracil 
(ÀURA) or containing FOA (FOA). FOA is toxic to cells with 
an active uracil biosynthetic pathway so only cells able to 
survive in the absence of the URA3-and CDC13-containing 
plasmid would be able to grow. As expected, cdc13D TLC1 </p>

<p>and cdc13D tlc1D mutants were able to grow on YEPD and 
-URA, but not on FOA medium, demonstrating that CDC13 
was essential for survival of these cell types (Figure 6B).

<p>than on -URA and YEPD consistent the poor growth of 
cdc13D exo1D pif1D cells on the tetrad dissection plate(s) 
(Figure 6A). Importantly, cdc13D tlc1D exo1D pif1D cells were 
able to grow on YEPD and -URA but not on FOA, demon-
strating that they could not survive in the absence of 
Cdc13. We conclude that telomerase is essential for the 
survival of cdc13D exo1D pif1D mutants, suggesting that 
Cdc13-independent recruitment of telomerase is essential 
for their survival. 
We used the same plasmid-based method to assess the 
requirement for various proteins involved in telomere main-
tenance to the growth of cdc13D exo1D pif1D mutants. We 
confirmed that TLC1 was required for the viability of cdc13D 
pif1D exo1D as cdc13D pif1D exo1D tlc1D mutants could not 
lose a plasmid carrying CDC13 (p[URA3]CDC13) (Figure 6C). 
We also found that Yku70 (a component of the Ku complex, 
which binds TLC1 to aid in recruitment of telomerase to the 
telomere) and Rad52 (required for homologous recombina-
tion and the generation of type I and type II survivor telomere 
structures) were required for the viability of cdc13D pif1D 
exo1D mutants (Figure 6C). However, we found that Pol32 
(subunit of Polymerase d, required for the generation of 
type I and type II survivor telomere structures) was dispen-
sable for the viability of cdc13D pif1D exo1D mutants 
(Figure 6C), although elimination of Pol32 did reduce the 
frequency at which cdc13D pif1D exo1D mutants were able to 
lose the pURA3[CDC13] (Supplementary Figure S12). We 
conclude that cdc13D pif1D exo1D mutants are distinct </p>

<p>from type I and type II survivors, as they do not require 
Pol32, and their telomeres are maintained through a combi-
nation of homologous recombination, Ku and telomerase 
activity. 
If cdc13D exo1D pif1D mutants are able to recruit telomer-
ase then they may not senesce or undergo the rearrangements 
in telomere structure characteristic of telomerase-deficient 
strains. To test this hypothesis, we compared the growth 
and telomere structure of cdc13D exo1D pif1D strains with 
tlc1D and tlc1D exo1D pif1D strains. As expected, telomerase-
deficient tlc1D mutants senesced and recovered (Figure 7A) 
and by passage 11 they had generated type I (lane 15, 
Figure 7B) and type II (lane 16, Figure 7B) survivors. 
Interestingly, cdc13D exo1D pif1D strains showed a slight 
growth defect at passage 1 (Figure 7A), consistent with the 
small colonies formed by cdc13D exo1D pif1D mutants on the 
tetrad dissection plate (Figure 6A) and the growth defect of 
cdc13D TLC1 
þ exo1D pif1D pURA3[CDC13] mutants grown </p>

<p>on FOA (Figure 6B). However, by passage 5 and in 
all subsequent passages cdc13D exo1D pif1D mutants had 
improved in growth (Figure 7A). The telomeres of cdc13D 
exo1D pif1D mutants were long with more variation in length, 
and by passage 11, the median telomere length and variance 
in length increased (lanes 9-12, 21-24, Figure 7B). This is 
consistent with previous work showing that hypomorphic 
alleles of Cdc13 can cause increased telomere length and 
variance in telomere length (Chandra et al, 2001). No clear 
alterations in the telomere structure of cdc13D exo1D pif1D 
mutants were observed, and at passage 1, their telomeres 
most closely resembled those of cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants 
with capped telomeres, which notably do not senesce (com-
pare lanes 2, 14 with lanes 9-12, Figure 7B). The growth and 
telomere structure of cdc13D exo1D pif1D mutants was clearly 
distinct from that of telomerase-deficient tlc1D exo1D pif1D 
mutants, which rapidly senesced and slowly recovered 
(Figure 7A), while maintaining a relatively normal telomere 
structure (compare lanes 7-8 with lanes 19-20, Figure 7B). 
We conclude that cdc13D exo1D pif1D mutants do not under-
go senescence and maintain their telomeres for at least 11 
passages (44 days). This is consistent with our notion that 
cdc13D exo1D pif1D mutants are able to maintain telomeres 
in a telomerase-dependent manner, even in the absence 
of Cdc13. 
Finally, although we observed that cdc13-1 exo1D 
pif1D mutants generated ssDNA only in the TG repeats, 
transiently over the course of a single cell cycle, we wished 
to know whether repeated cell division in the absence of 
telomere capping would lead to accumulation of ssDNA. By 
in-gel assay, we found that cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants 
grown at 361C for 4 h (B2 population doublings with un-
capped telomeres) and cdc13D exo1D pif1D mutants 
from Passage 1 (B50 population doublings with uncapped 
telomeres) generated comparable levels of ssDNA in the 
TG repeats to a yku70D mutant (Figure 7C and D). 
This was comparable to the transient level of ssDNA seen 
in cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants 2 h after telomere uncapping, 
within a single cell cycle (Figure 4G). We conclude 
that continued growth following telomere uncapping in 
exo1D pif1D mutants does not lead to ssDNA accumulation. 
This suggests that no residual nuclease activities continue 
to resect uncapped telomeres in the absence of Pif1 
and Exo1. </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>We have shown that Pif1 and Exo1 are responsible for 
extensive ssDNA generation at uncapped telomeres in 
cdc13-1 mutants and also that Pif1 has telomerase-indepen-
dent functions at telomeres. This leads us to propose a model 
where Pif1 can initiate the DDR at uncapped telomeres by 
controlling nuclease activity. Furthermore, and remarkably, 
cells lacking Pif1 and Exo1 are viable and grow well in the 
absence of the usually essential telomere capping protein 
Cdc13. 
In our model (Figure 8), Pif1 unwinds telomeric duplex 
DNA, generating ssDNA that is cleaved by an unidentified 
ssDNA endonuclease in a manner analogous to the function 
of Pif1 in Okazaki fragment processing and at stalled replica-
tion forks (Budd et al, 2006; Chang et al, 2009; George et al,  2009; Pike et al, 2009). We propose that close to the chromo-
some end (o5 kb) both Pif1-and Exo1-dependent activities 
generate ssDNA, causing weak initial checkpoint activation. 
We propose that Exo1 subsequently generates ssDNA 45 kb 
from the chromosome end, leading to stronger checkpoint 
activation that is sufficient to arrest all cells with uncapped 
telomeres. Our model is consistent with Pif1 being ExoY, a 
hypothetical nuclease proposed to function in parallel to Exo1 
at uncapped telomeres (Zubko et al, 2004). Pif1, like ExoY, is 
more important for ssDNA generation at the end of the 
chromosome than further away (Figure 4E). 
In our model, Exo1 recognizes the junction between 3 </p>

<p>0 </p>

<p>(TG) ssDNA and duplex DNA, at native telomeric overhangs 
as previously suggested (Maringele and Lydall, 2002) or at 
stalled replication forks (Segurado and Diffley, 2008). We 
propose that Pif1 binds and unwinds 5 
0 (AC) overhangs 
because Pif1 is a 5 
0 -3 
0 helicase (Lahaye et al, 1991; Zhou  et al, 2000; Pike et al, 2009). If Pif1 does engage telomeric 
dsDNA and convert it to ssDNA, 5 
0 (AC) ssDNA presumably 
exists (Supplementary Figure S15A). Interestingly, 5 
0 telo-
meric ssDNA has been observed both in mammalian cells 
and in Caenorhabditis elegans (Cimino-Reale et al, 2003;   Raices et al, 2008) and but not so far in S. cerevisiae. 
However, 5 
0 ssDNA overhangs could in principle occur at 
stalled replication fork structures (Supplementary Figure 
S15B) or Okazaki fragments. 
DSBs that can be repaired by homologous recombination 
and DSB-induced shortened telomeres are processed by 
nucleases dependent upon Sgs1/Dna2, Exo1 and MRX/Sae2 
(Gravel et al, 2008; Zhu et al, 2008; Mimitou and Symington,  2009). Other work recently published from our laboratory 
demonstrates that Sgs1 also contributes to resection of 
uncapped telomeres, but elimination of Sgs1 and Exo1 is 
insufficient to prevent the resection of uncapped telomeres 
in cdc13-1 mutants (Ngo and Lydall, 2010). The work pres-
ented here demonstrates that elimination of Pif1 and Exo1 
prevents resection of uncapped telomeres in cdc13-1 mutants. 
However, at DSBs that can be repaired by homologous 
recombination or at DSB-induced shortened telomeres, Pif1 
has little effect on resection (Zhu et al, 2008; Bonetti et al,  2009). Interestingly, Pif1 has been shown to have a critical 
role repair of DSBs where break-induced replication (BIR) 
is the main repair pathway (Chung et al, 2010). A major 
challenge will be to determine which substrates are exposed 
at DSBs, shortened telomeres and uncapped telomeres and 
how nuclease activities are coordinated to process them. 
Pif1 contributes to the vitality of cells lacking telomerase, 
both before and after recovery from senescence (Figure 5B). 
Interestingly, pif1D cells improve their growth following 
senescence without adopting typical survivor-like telomeric 
DNA structures (Figure 5C). Usually following senescence, 
survivors are generated by homologous-recombination-and 
BIR-dependent alterations in telomere structure (Teng and  Zakian, 1999; Lydeard et al, 2007). If BIR is eliminated, cells 
lacking telomerase senesce and undergo a complete loss in 
viability (Lydeard et al, 2007). The relatively unaltered 
telomere structure and poor growth following senescence in 
cells lacking Pif1 and telomerase is consistent with the 
impaired BIR seen in cells lacking Pif1 (Chung et al, 2010). 
Therefore, reduced BIR in pif1D cells may be sufficient to </p>

<p>Figure 8 A model for the roles of Pif1 and Exo1 in the DDR at uncapped telomeres. Following telomere uncapping, 5 
0 and 3 
0 ssDNA is exposed 
within 5 kb of the chromosome end, serving as a substrate for resection. 5 
0 ssDNA is unwound by Pif1 and presumably cleaved by an 
unidentified ssDNA endonuclease, whereas the junction between 3 
0 ssDNA and dsDNA is recognized and resected by the exonuclease Exo1. 
This low-level processing leads to weak checkpoint activation. Resection of 3 
0 ssDNA overhangs beyond 5 kb requires Exo1. This further 
processing causes robust checkpoint activation. </p>

<p>maintain comparatively normal telomere structure in telo-
merase-deficient cells but insufficient to permit the typical 
amplification of Y 
0 elements or terminal TG repeats seen in 
survivors. The absence of telomeric repeat amplification 
could prevent these cells from achieving the high levels of 
post-senescence growth seen in other telomerase-deficient 
mutants. 
We have demonstrated that attenuation of the DDR at 
uncapped telomeres, by elimination of Pif1 and Exo1 permits 
telomere maintenance in a Cdc13-indpendent but telomerase 
and Ku-dependent manner. This is surprising because Cdc13 
is considered crucial for efficient recruitment of telomerase 
and thus to prevent senescence (Nugent et al, 1996). We 
propose that in the absence of Cdc13, Yku80 binds TLC1, the 
telomerase RNA, to help recruit telomerase to the telomere 
(Peterson et al, 2001). The requirement for Rad52 for the 
survival of cdc13D exo1D pif1D mutants is surprising. It will 
be interesting to investigate whether telomeric repeats from 
extremely long telomeres in cdc13D exo1D pif1D mutants 
(Figure 7B) can be distributed to shorter telomeres by homo-
logous recombination, thus preventing short telomeres from 
becoming critically short. Finally, it will also be paramount to 
determine whether the requirement for telomerase in cdc13D 
exo1D pif1D mutants is a consequence of the increased 
utilization of telomerase that has been reported at the telo-
meres of cells lacking Pif1 (Boule et al, 2005). 
We show that following inactivation of Cdc13 or telomer-
ase, telomeric DNA can be stabilized by elimination of Pif1, 
eliminating resection of uncapped telomeres in cells lacking 
Cdc13 or permitting telomere maintenance without the gen-
eration of typical type I or type II survivor structures in cells 
lacking telomerase. As Pif1 and Exo1 are conserved from 
yeast, to mice, to humans, Pif1 might also contribute to 
the premature mortality caused by telomere dysfunction in 
telomerase knockout mice (Lahaye et al, 1991; Huang and  Symington, 1993; Wei et al, 2003; Mateyak and Zakian, 2006;  Snow et al, 2007). pif1

it might be interesting to combine these mutations in a 
telomerase knockout background to investigate the conse-

À/À mice, as </p>

<p>EXO1 contributes to the telomere dysfunction and premature

<p>Materials and methods </p>

<p>Bioinformatics/analysis 
A genetic interaction network was created in Cytoscape using 
S. cerevisiae genetic interactions from BioGRID (v2.0.53) (Stark  et al, 2006; Cline et al, 2007). Genes that had genetic interactions 
with EXO1 were identified (first neighbours of EXO1). A ranked list 
of all known genes was created, according to how many of the first 
neighbours of EXO1 they had a genetic interaction with. The top 
10% of this ranked list were then shown. Nodes for each gene were 
coloured according to whether the genes affected cdc13-1 growth 
defects or telomere length (Askree et al, 2004; Zubko et al, 2004;  Downey et al, 2006; Gatbonton et al, 2006; Tsolou and Lydall, 2007;  Addinall et al, 2008; Ungar et al, 2009). </p>

<p>Yeast strains 
All strains used in this study are RAD5 
þ and in the W303 genetic 
background (Strain Table, Supplementary data). Standard genetic 
procedures of transformation and tetrad analysis were used. New 
gene deletions were constructed by transforming a diploid with </p>

<p>PCR-based deletion modules (Goldstein and McCusker, 1999). Point 
mutations were generated integrated into the genome as described 
(Schulz and Zakian, 1994; Ribeyre et al, 2009). </p>

<p>Yeast growth assays 
Growth assays were performed as previously described (Zubko  et al, 2004). Pooled colonies were inoculated into 2 ml of YEPD and 
grown to saturation at 231C. Five-fold serial dilutions were 
replicated onto agar plates and grown at a range of temperatures. 
Plates were photographed using an SPimager (S&amp;P Robotics). 
Levels were adjusted with <rs id="software-0" type="software">Photoshop</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">CS4</rs>. </p>

<p>Passage experiments and quantification of growth 
To passage cultures, multiple individual colonies were pooled and 
restruck. Where growth was quantified, unmodified images were 
analysed with Colonyzer (Lawless et al, 2010) and the sum of the 
trimmed greyscale pixel values for all pixels corresponding to spots 
and colonies of each strain were used as a measure of growth. 
Growth was then expressed relative to a TLC1 
þ or TLC1 
þ CDC13 </p>

<p>þ </p>

<p>strain included on the same plate. </p>

<p>Telomere length detection 
Southern hybridization to examine telomere length and structure 
was performed similarly to previously described (Maringele and  Lydall, 2004). Genomic DNA was extracted, digested with XhoI then 
run overnight on a 1% agarose gel at 1 V/cm. Southern transfer and 
detection was then performed using DIG-High Prime Labelling and 
Detection Kit (Roche) as per the manufacturer's instructions and 
visualized on a FUJI LAS4000. Telomeric probes were synthesized 
using PCR DIG Probe Synthesis Kit (Roche). TG probe was B180 bp 
of TG repeats, whereas Y 
0 probe was B820 bp of Y 
0 sequence, both 
amplified from pDL987 (pHT128) (Tsubouchi and Ogawa, 2000)  using oligos m933 and m934 or m935 and m936, respectively. 
CDC15 probe was synthesized using oligos m1045 and m1046 as 
previously described (Foster et al, 2006). </p>

<p>Synchronous cultures, cell cycle scoring and QAOS 
Experiments to measure cell cycle progression and ssDNA following 
telomere uncapping were carried out in bar1D cdc15-2 cdc13-1 cells 
and performed as described (Zubko et al, 2006). Where indicated, 
cells were treated with Bleomycin at a final concentration of 
50 mg/ml (Morin et al, 2008). </p>

<p>Rad53 phosphorylation 
Western blotting to detect Rad53 phosphorylation was performed 
essentially as described (Morin et al, 2008). Antibodies against 
Rad53 were from Dan Durocher, Toronto. Anti-tubulin antibodies 
were from Keith Gull, Oxford. Multiple gels were run to process all 
samples from a single experiment, but were transferred and 
detected in parallel and imaged simultaneously. </p>

<p>In-gel assay 
In-gel assays were performed essentially as previously described 
(Zubko and Lydall, 2006) using a Cy5-labelled oligonucleotide 
(m2188) detected on a GE Healthcare Typhoon Trio imager. 
Following detection of ssDNA, the gel was subjected to Southern 
transfer and hybridization to detect CDC15. To quantify ssDNA, the 
fluorescent signal from the 0.7 to 12 kb range on the gel was 
measured, relative to the intensity of an exponentially dividing 
yku70D mutant on the same gel. All values were then normalized 
relative to the CDC15 signal as determined by Southern blot. </p>

<p>The genus Plagiostoma (Gnomoniaceae, Diaporthales) includes 
microscopic fungi that inhabit the leaves, stems, twigs, and branches 
of woody and herbaceous plants from a range of families including 
the Betulaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Geraniaceae, Hippocastanaceae, 
Oleaceae, Polygonaceae, Salicaceae, Sapindaceae, and 
Staphylaceae in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere 
(Sogonov et al. 2008). Although some species of Plagiostoma 
cause diseases, most do not show symptoms prior to production 
of perithecia on dead tissues. Described by Fuckel (1870), 
the morphological concept of Plagiostoma remained relatively 
unchanged (Barr 1978, Monod 1983) until recently. Multigene 
phylogenetic studies suggest that the genus Plagiostoma forms 
a highly supported monophyletic clade that includes the type 
species of Plagiostoma, P. euphorbiae, and the type species of 
Cryptodiaporthe, C. aesculi, among others (Mejía et al. 2008, 
Sogonov et al. 2008). Sogonov et al. (2008) included 13 species 
in the genus Plagiostoma, several of which were previously placed 
in Cryptodiaporthe. 
A brief historical account of the major taxonomic treatments 
of Plagiostoma and Cryptodiaporthe illustrates the views of 
these genera through time. Fuckel (1870) proposed the genus 
Plagiostoma for sphaericeaous species characterised by 
flattened perithecia oriented horizontally having short, lateral, 
erumpent necks. Fuckel (1870) included the genera Ceratostoma, 
Gnomonia, Linospora, Melanospora, and Rhaphidospora together 
with Plagiostoma in the tribe Ceratostomeae of the Sphaeriacei. In 
his original description of Plagiostoma, Fuckel (1870) included four </p>

<p>species, P. euphorbiae, P. petiolicola, P devexum, and P. suspecta. 
Fuckel's concept of Plagiostoma was followed by Höhnel (1917) 
and von Arx (1951) who, like Fuckel, considered Plagiostoma to 
be relatively closely related to Gnomonia, the name on which the 
Gnomoniaceae is based. These authors differentiated Gnomonia 
from Plagiostoma mainly by orientation of the perithecial neck. 
Gnomonia was characterised by having central, upright, perithecial 
necks in contrast to species of Plagiostoma with eccentric, 
laterally oriented, perithecial necks. In her treatment of the order 
Diaporthales, Barr (1978) followed Fuckel's concept of Plagiostoma 
and placed Gnomonia and Plagiostoma in the same suborder 
Gnomoniineae but in different families, i.e. Gnomonia in the 
Gnomoniaceae and Plagiostoma in the Valsaceae. The Valsaceae 
was defined based on having "beaks oblique or lateral, erumpent 
separately or converging through stromatic disc" (Barr, 1978 p. 
15). Barr (1978) made nine new combinations in Plagiostoma 
expanding the number of species in the genus to 13. 
In his monograph of the Gnomoniaceae, Monod (1983) 
accepted most species treated by Barr (1978). However, Monod 
considered that the typification of Plagiostoma as P. euphorbiae 
by Höhnel (1917) was not representative of Plagiostoma because 
the perithecial necks of this species are eccentric rather than 
lateral as stipulated by Fuckel (1870). Monod (1983) transferred 
P. euphorbiae to the genus Gnomonia and re-typified Plagiostoma 
with P. devexum. In agreement with Barr (1991) and Sogonov et al. 
(2008) the typification of the genus Plagiostoma with P. euphorbiae 
by Höhnel (1917) is accepted here because this typification 
predates Monod (1983) and is in accordance with Article 10 of the 
International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (McNeill et al. 2006). </p>

<p>Abstract: Members of the genus Plagiostoma inhabit leaves, stems, twigs, and branches of woody and herbaceous plants predominantly in the temperate Northern Hemisphere. 
An account of all known species of Plagiostoma including Cryptodiaporthe is presented based on analyses of morphological, cultural, and DNA sequence data. Multigene 
phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences from four genes (β-tubulin, ITS, rpb2, and tef1-α) revealed eight previously undescribed phylogenetic species and an association 
between a clade composed of 11 species of Plagiostoma and the host family Salicaceae. In this paper these eight new species of Plagiostoma are described, four species are 
redescribed, and four new combinations are proposed. A key to the 25 accepted species of Plagiostoma based on host, shape, and size of perithecia, perithecial arrangement 
in the host, and microscopic characteristics of the asci and ascospores is provided. Disposition of additional names in Cryptodiaporthe and Plagiostoma is also discussed. </p>

<p>a SySteMatic account of the genuS Plagiostoma </p>

<p>In addition, the character of perithecial neck orientation has been 
found not to be phylogenetically informative (Sogonov et al. 2008). 
Cryptodiaporthe was described by Petrak (1921) for species with 
euvalsoid arrangement of perithecia and, in contrast to Diaporthe, 
lacks a blackened margin in the substratum surrounding the 
perithecia. In describing Cryptodiaporthe, Petrak (1921) designated 
C. aesculi as type and included C. hystrix and C. populina. Later, 
Wehmeyer (1933) recircumscribed Cryptodiaporthe emphasising 
the lack of a blackened margin within the substratum and made 17 
new combinations in this genus for species previously included in 
Diaporthe expanding the genus to 19 species. 
In this study, specimens of Plagiostoma were collected 
primarily from North America but also from South America, Europe, 
and China. Among these recent collections eight new species were 
discovered and a number of described species were recollected, 
cultured, and sequenced. A multigene phylogenetic analysis is 
provided of 24 of the 25 species of Plagiostoma accepted here. 
Eight new species are described and illustrated, four species are 
redescribed, and four new combinations are proposed. A key to 
the 25 accepted species of Plagiostoma is provided along with the 
disposition of additional species names in Cryptodiaporthe and 
Plagiostoma. </p>

<p>MATERIAL AND METHODS </p>

<p>Collection of specimens, culture preparation, and 
morphological observations </p>

<p>Collections were made as listed in Table 1 from the following 
countries mainly during the spring and summers of 2007 and 2008: 
Argentina (Tucumán), China (Yunnan), France (Deux-Sèvres 
Département), Germany (Frankfurt), and the United States of 
America (California, Maryland, New York, Oregon, Washington). 
Specimens consisting of overwintered, dead, attached, or fallen 
twigs and branches with perithecia were placed in paper bags, air-
dried, and stored at 8-10 °C in sealed plastic bags for a period of 
1 wk to 6 mo before processing. All specimens are deposited in the 
U.S. National Fungus Collections (BPI). 
Observations, measurements, and digital imaging of 
morphological characters and isolation of cultures were performed 
using the same equipment and procedures as in Mejía et al. (2008). 
<rs id="software-8" type="software">AxioVision</rs> <rs corresp="#software-8" type="version-number">v. 4.7.2.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-8" type="creator">Carl Zeiss Image Solutions</rs>, Carl Zeiss, New 
York, NY, USA) was used in conjunction with those methods to 
measure structures. Fresh specimens were mounted in water for 
microscopic observations; dried specimens were mounted in 3 % 
potassium hydroxide. Cultural characteristics were observed on 
Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA, Difco™, Becton, Dickinson &amp; Co., 
Sparks, MD, USA) 7 d after plating as described in Mejía et al. 
(2008). Colony diameters were measured twice perpendicularly 
and averaged and thus are listed as average colony diameter 
(a.c.d.). Representative cultures of species considered in this study 
were deposited at the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures 
(CBS, The Netherlands) as listed in Table 1. </p>

<p>DNA extraction and PCR amplification </p>

<p>DNA extractions were done as described by Mejía et al. (2008) 
using a Fast Prep FP 120 with Lysing Matrix "A" (MP Biomedicals, 
Solon, OH, USA) for mechanical lysis. Four gene fragments 
were amplified and sequenced for the phylogenetic analyses: the 
complete nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions 1 
and 2 including 5.8 S rDNA (ITS), regions of the RNA polymerase 
second largest subunit (rpb2), beta-tubulin (β-tubulin), and 
translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1-α) genes. The ITS and 
rpb2 genes were amplified and sequenced as described in Mejía et 
al. (2008) in 25 μL reactions with two internal sequencing primers 
designed specifically for species of Plagiostoma: rpb2 Plag-F (5' 
CGT CGC TGC ATY ATC TCR CA 3') and rpb2 Plag-R (5' TGY 
GAG ATR ATG CAG CGA CG 3'). β-tubulin was amplified using 
primers T1 and T22 and sequenced with the PCR primers and 
the internal primers T2 and T12 from O'Donnell &amp; Cigelnik (1997). 
For some isolates it was necessary to amplify the tef1-α region 
in two fragments using the following primer combinations: EF1-
728F /EF1-1199R and EF1-983F/ EF1-1567R (Carbone &amp; Kohn 
1999, Castlebury, unpubl. data, for primer 1199R 5' GGG AAG TAC 
CMG TGA TCA TGT 3', Rehner 2001). The rpb2 gene could not be 
amplified for P. convexum, P. euphorbiaceum, and P. pulchellum 
CBS 170.69. In addition, β-tubulin could not be amplified for P. 
pulchellum CBS 170.69. For the purpose of determining taxonomic 
affinities of species previously described as Cryptodiaporthe or 
Plagiostoma but not congeneric with P. euphorbiae (type species), 
a region of the nuclear ribosomal large subunit (LSU) was amplified 
as described in Castlebury et al. (2002). </p>

<p>Phylogenetic analyses </p>

<p>Editing and alignment of DNA sequences were performed as 
described in Mejía et al. (2008). Individual genes were aligned 
separately and subsequently concatenated into a single alignment. 
Table 1 includes detailed information about the gene sequences 
including GenBank numbers. The concatenated sequence 
alignment includes β-tubulin (1584 bp), ITS (625 bp), rpb2 (1212 
bp), and tef1-α (1149 bp) for a total of 4570 bp and 45 isolates. 
The taxa included in this alignment represent 24 of the 25 accepted 
species of Plagiostoma with Apiognomonia hystrix and A. veneta 
as outgroup taxa. Outgroup selection was based on the sister 
relationship of the genus Apiognomonia with Plagiostoma as 
inferred by a three-gene phylogeny of the family Gnomoniaceae 
(Sogonov et al. 2008). Positions with ambiguous alignment were 
excluded from the analyses. 
The concatenated alignment was partitioned by gene and codon 
position for β-tubulin, rpb2, and tef1-α using <rs id="software-9" type="software">PAUP</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-9" type="creator">Swofford</rs> 2002). 
The gene partitions were analysed for conflict with the partition 
homogeneity test (PHT) as implemented in <rs id="software-10" type="software">PAUP</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-10" type="creator">Swofford</rs> 2002) 
using the following settings: 100 homogeneity replicates, 10 random 
sequence addition replicates, and MULTREES off. Conflict among 
gene partitions was assessed by reciprocal bootstrap analyses 
(Reeb et al. 2004) using distance settings for each partition as </p>

Genes were first analysed individually and then as a combined 
alignment using maximum parsimony, Bayesian, and maximum 
likelihood analyses. Trees and bootstrap support of branches 
were estimated by MP analysis as in Sogonov et al. (2008) with 
all characters considered unordered with equal weight and an 
additional analysis with unordered characters weighted as follows: 
weight = 3 for first and second codon positions and weight = 1 
for third codon position. Additionally, trees were estimated using

(AIC). The first 50 000 generations were discarded (burn-in period) 
based on comparison of tree likelihood scores. A 50 % majority rule 
consensus tree and a consensus phylogram were constructed from 
the trees saved after the burn-in period. The Bayesian posterior 
probabilities (PP) of nodes of the consensus trees are presented 
in Fig. 1. Trees were also estimated by Maximum Likelihood (ML)

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>Collection of specimens </p>

<p>The following plant species are reported as new hosts for species of 
Plagiostoma: Alnus tenuifolia, Salix dasyclados, S. humboldtiana, 
S. irrorata, S. lucida, and S. sitchensis (Table 1). Plagiostoma 
pulchellum from Argentina and P. yunnanense from southwestern 
China were collected in regions where no species of Plagiostoma 
had been previously reported. </p>

<p>Phylogenetic analyses </p>

<p>The partition homogeneity test suggested conflict among the four 
genes (ITS, rpb2, β-tubulin, and tef1-α) sequenced for this study (P 
= 0.01) with rpb2 as the source of this conflict. For combinations 
of the remaining three genes (ITS, β-tubulin, and tef1-α), no 
incongruence among gene trees was detected when all three were 
analysed (P = 0.09), with P = 0.07 for ITS and β-tubulin and P = 
0.24 for ITS and tef1-α. The following are the likelihood settings 
estimated for each gene for the reciprocal NJ bootstrap analyses: 
ITS: Base = equal Nst = 2 TRatio = 2.5434 Rates = equal Pinvar = 
0.8337; rpb2: Base = equal Nst = 6 Rmat = (1.0000 4.6961 1.0000 
1.0000 13.3827) Rates = gamma Shape = 0.2029 Pinvar = 0; 
β-tubulin: Base = (0.2006 0.3249 0.2505) Nst = 2 TRatio = 2.1757 
Rates = gamma Shape = 0.5017 Pinvar = 0; and tef1-α: Base = 
(0.1918 0.3110 0.2229) Nst = 2 TRatio = 1.8586 Rates = gamma 
Shape = 0.6109 Pinvar = 0. 
The ITS, β-tubulin, and tef1-α trees individually resolved terminal 
clades for most of the species analysed. Trees for each gene are 
provided -see online Supplementary Information. No single gene 
analysis resolved all the species of Plagiostoma with bootstrap 
support higher than 70 %. The following numbers of species were 
resolved by genes with bootstrap &gt; 70 %: ITS = 11, rpb2 = 9, </p>

<p>β-tubulin = 12, and tef1-α = 11. In general, rpb2 was not as useful for 
resolving clades of closely related species as the other three genes. 
The ITS gene resolved and supported all terminal clades except P. 
amygdalinae and P. euphorbiaceae for which the sequences were 
nearly identical. However, it did not support backbone nodes at 
levels greater than 70 %. In contrast, bootstrap support greater than 
90 % for all backbone nodes containing two or more species was 
obtained in the β-tubulin, rpb2, and tef1-α gene trees. The topology 
of the individual gene trees differed only slightly. One topological 
conflict supported by bootstrap values greater than 70 % was 
observed between the β-tubulin analysis resulting in a clade (97 %) 
that included all species of Plagiostoma on Salicaceae and the rpb2 
analysis resulting in a clade (72 %) that included some but not all the 
species on Salicaceae with some species on other hosts. 
Phylogenetic trees resulting from the combined four-gene 
dataset (ITS, β-tubulin, rpb2, and tef1-α) were compared with 
those resulting from the ITS, β-tubulin, tef1-α dataset found to 
be conflict-free by the PHT. Maximum parsimony analyses of the 
four-gene combination resulted in 114 equally parsimonious trees 
(length = 1713, CI = 0.689, RI = 0.809) for the unweighted analysis 
and 42 equally parsimonious trees (length = 2062, CI = 0.689, 
RI = 0.807) for the weighted analysis. Fifty percent majority rule 
consensus trees computed for each analysis did not differ in the 
terminal species clades but higher bootstrap support was obtained 
for several clades in the weighted analysis. Maximum parsimony 
analysis of the three-gene combination composed of ITS, β-tubulin, 
and tef-α resulted in eight equally parsimonious trees (length = 
1275, CI = 0.707, RI = 0.817). The tree topologies obtained by 
MP analyses of the two alignments did not contradict each other; 
however, bootstrap support for several nodes increased in analyses 
of the four-gene combination. Therefore, subsequent analyses 
were performed on the four-gene combination. 
The following models were the best estimates for each gene 
and were applied during the Bayesian analyses: HKY + I + G for 
ITS and tef1-α, SYM + G for rpb2, and HKY + G for β-tubulin. The 
model TrN+G was estimated to be the best for the entire alignment by 
both hLRT and BIC and those settings were applied to the maximum 
likelihood analysis: Base = (0.2245 0.2859 0.2454) Nst = 6 Rmat 
= (1.0000 3.5234 1.0000 1.0000 5.8336) Rates = gamma Shape 
= 0.2849 Pinvar = 0. Bayesian, ML, MP, and weighted parsimony 
(WP) analyses of the four-gene alignment all resulted in the same 
topology. Maximum likelihood analysis of the concatenated alignment 
of four genes resulted in one tree -lnL score of 13921.12887 and 
is presented as the inferred phylogeny of Plagiostoma (Fig. 1). 
Bayesian PP and MP bootstraps are shown above and below the 
branches. This phylogeny of Plagiostoma supports the recognition of 
eight new species, which are described in the taxonomic section of 
this work. Bayesian PP and MP bootstrap supports greater than 90 
% were obtained for all the species of Plagiostoma in this multigene 
phylogeny. Plagiostoma euphorbiae-verrucosae is not included in the 
multigene phylogeny as only the ITS was available for this species. 
This species was confirmed as belonging in Plagiostoma by analysis 
of ITS sequences (tree not shown). </p>

<p>Evaluation of clades and species </p>

<p>Both Bayesian analysis and MP bootstrapping support a clade 
containing 11 species that occurs exclusively on hosts of the family 
Salicaceae. All of these species occur on the bark of twigs and 
branches with one species, Plagiostoma versatile, also occurring 
in the leaf midvein and petioles. Within the species on Salicaceae, </p>

<p>a SySteMatic account of the genuS Plagiostoma </p>

<p>one clade consists of four closely related species characterised by 
having an expanded perithecial neck: P. apiculatum, P. dilatatum, P. 
imperceptibile, and P. pulchellum. These species are distinguished by 
morphological features such as perithecium size, ascospore size and 
length-to-width (l : w) ratio, and hyphal colour in culture. Plagiostoma 
imperceptibile is characterised by having ascospores longer than 18 
μm but with a length-width ratio (l : w) less than five. Plagiostoma </p>

<p>pulchellum is characterised by having ascospores with a l : w greater 
than five and by producing rosy-coloured hyphae that become dark 
green on PDA. Plagiostoma apiculatum and P. dilatatum are similar 
to one another but the perithecia and ascospores of P. dilatatum are 
larger than those of P. apiculatum. Plagiostoma convexum with a 
moderately expanded perithecial neck is highly supported (&gt; 95 % 
MP, PP) as basal to these four species. </p>

<p>Mejía et al. </p>

<p>Plagiostoma ovalisporum and the pathogenic species P. 
populinum are closely related and contained within a larger clade 
including the five species previously mentioned (100 % MP, PP). 
The remaining species of Plagiostoma on Salicaceae form a weakly 
supported clade sister to the species on Salicaceae with expanded 
necks mentioned above. This clade contains three species having 
cylindrical, usually elongated, perithecial necks, and elongated 
ascospores: P. salicellum, P. versatile, and P. yunnanense. The 
remaining member of this clade, P. oregonense, is characterised by 
short, expanded perithecial necks and short ascospores. 
Bayesian PP and MP bootstrapping also support a clade 
(83 % MP, 100 % PP) of eight species with hosts representing 
a range of woody and herbaceous plant families. One of the 
subclades in this group is composed of three species that grow 
on Euphorbiaceae: P. amygdalinae, P. euphorbiaceum, and P. 
euphorbiae, type species of the genus. Basal to these species is P. 
fraxinum on Fraxinus pennsylvanica. A second subclade contains 
P. exstocollum and P. samuelsii both on betulaceous hosts and P. 
rhododendri on Rhododendron. The rest of the species included in 
the tree, namely P. aesculi, P. barriae, P. geranii, P. petiolophilum, 
and P. robergeanum, are relatively distant from one another and 
the species previously mentioned. Plagiostoma robergeanum, a 
species that grows on Staphylea (Staphyleaceae) in Europe, was 
basal to the other species of Plagiostoma. 
Specimens of P. pulchellum were collected in Europe, North 
America (USA), and South America (Argentina). This species is 
recognised as the most widely distributed species of Plagiostoma 
included in this study and is presented here as the first report of 
Gnomoniaceae for South America. Plagiostoma yunnanense is the 
first report of Plagiostoma for China. </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>Due to the morphological diversity in species of Plagiostoma, as 
illustrated in Figs 2-6, no single morphological character is unique 
or diagnostic for this genus. The following morphological characters 
differentiate Plagiostoma from other genera of the Gnomoniaceae 
as defined by Sogonov et al. (2008, table 2). Unlike Gnomonia, 
species of Plagiostoma have perithecia that often collapse from 
the base when dry as illustrated in Sogonov et al. (2008, fig. 43 
B-C). In Plagiostoma the neck length is short to long about equal 
or less than the diameter of perithecia, while in Ophiognomonia the 
perithecial neck length is usually very long, often pointed, and 2.5-
5 times the perithecial diameter. Species of Ophiognomonia occur 
only on leaves while those of Plagiostoma are found on leaves as 
well as woody tissues. Except for P. rhododendri, the ascospores of 
Plagiostoma are not broader at the upper part as in Gnomoniopsis. 
Ascospores of Plagiostoma are never cylindrical or femuroid as 
in Cryptosporella. Species of Plagiostoma with ellipsoid, aseptate 
ascospores similar to those of C. hypodermia do not have a valsoid 
arrangement of perithecia as do species of Cryptosporella. 
Species of Plagiostoma, except for P. rhododendri, are not 
apiosporous, differentiating them from species of Apiognomonia 
except A. hystrix, which possesses flattened perithecial necks. 
Species of Pleuroceras have elongated ascospores that are quite 
distinct from those of Plagiostoma. The type and only species of 
Ditopella, D. ditopa, is characterised by having polysporic asci. 
Phragmoporthe conformis, a species closely related to Ditopella 
ditopa, is characterised by phragmosporic ascospores, a character 
not present in Plagiostoma. The perithecia of Amphiporthe </p>

<p>hranicensis, the type species of Amphiporthe, are grouped near 
the base of the entostroma and, thus, are different from those 
found in Plagiostoma. In addition, Amphiporthe hranicensis 
produces perithecia in clusters of up to 20, with perithecial necks 
protruding as a group from the host periderm and surrounded by 
gray stromatic tissue. 
Perithecial neck characters and ascospore morphology are the 
most important characters for differentiating Plagiostoma from other 
genera in the Gnomoniaceae. Host identity, geographic locality, 
and presence or absence of stroma are secondary characters for 
the identification of species. For example, the presence of white 
stromatic tissues surrounding the emerging perithecial necks 
is diagnostic in species such as P. aesculi, P. salicellum, and P. 
samuelsii. Within Plagiostoma perithecial neck shape ranges from 
very short, cylindrical to expanded and thick or thin, cylindrical and 
elongated with various shapes in the opening area, e.g. conic, 
flared, or rounded. In one species, P. versatile, the perithecial 
neck can be both very short when on twigs or elongated when on 
a leaf midvein suggesting that this structure varies with substrate. 
Four species, P. apiculatum, P. convexum, P. dilatatum, and P. 
imperceptibile, are characterised by having an apically expanded 
perithecial neck. The expanded neck was noticed by Wallroth 
(1833, as coronatum dilatatis) and Butin (1958, as cushion-or pad-
like structure) but neither of these authors used this character to 
differentiate species. This structure may be involved in rupture of 
host periderm and release of the ascospores. 
The asci of Plagiostoma are clavate, obclavate, ovoidal, 
cylindrical, or cylindric-fusoid, generally with a short stalk but with 
a long stalk in P. imperceptibile. Ascospores of Plagiostoma are 
ellipsoid, ellipsoid-fusoid, oblong-ellipsoid, or ovoid usually with one 
median septum, although three species, P. euphorbiae-verrucosae, 
P. fraxini, and P. ovalisporum, have non-septate ascospores and 
one species, P. rhododendri, is apiosporous. Ascospores vary in 
size from short, 7.7-13.8 × 2.2-6.6 μm in P. fraxini, to relatively 
long, 18-27 × 3-4 μm in P. versatile and P. yunnanense. Most 
species lack appendages although P. salicellum has short, thick, 
evanescent appendages and P. devexum and P. samuelsii may 
have long, thin appendages. Morphological characters that are 
phylogenetically informative for subclades of Plagiostoma include 
the expanded neck characteristic of species with broadly ellipsoid 
ascospores versus the cylindrical neck characteristic of species 
with narrowly ellipsoidal ascospores. 
In traditional classification schemes of the Diaporthales, 
Cryptodiaporthe and Plagiostoma were considered distinct and 
not closely related genera, each with a specific morphology and 
arrangement of perithecia (Barr 1978, Kobayashi 1970, Monod 
1983). Species of Plagiostoma were characterised by the lack of a 
stroma and production of a single perithecium, primarily on leaves. 
Species of Cryptodiaporthe were characterised by production of a 
rudimentary stroma and grouped perithecia, primarily in the bark 
of their host branches. The differences between Cryptodiaporthe 
and Plagiostoma have been emphasised such that some authors 
placed them in different families or subfamilies (Barr 1978, 
Wehmeyer 1975). 
Monod's (1983) concept of Plagiostoma differed significantly 
from the concept presented here. Of the 13 species treated by Monod 
(1983) as Plagiostoma, only Plagiostoma devexum is accepted 
here in that genus. Of the 13 species of Plagiostoma accepted by 
Sogonov et al. (2008), only P. euphorbiae and P. devexum were 
originally described as Plagiostoma with Plagiostoma barriae newly 
described in that work. Plagiostoma aesculi and P. salicellum were 
previously regarded by Wehmeyer (1933) as Cryptodiaporthe. Four </p>

<p>additional species of Cryptodiaporthe are here formally combined 
in Plagiostoma, namely P. apiculatum, P. convexum, P. populinum, 
and P. pulchellum. The recognition of these four species formerly 
classified as Cryptodiaporthe salicina broadens the range of 
morphological and ecological traits of the genus Plagiostoma. The 
pathogenic species, P. apiculatum, P. fraxini, and P. populinum, 
contrasts with the concept of Plagiostoma as primarily saprobic. 
The economically important species of Plagiostoma are 
pathogens that cause cankers on willows and poplars. Plagiostoma 
apiculatum (synonym Cryptodiaporthe salicella) is here determined 
to be the correct name for the fungus causing a canker disease 
of willow (Sinclair &amp; Lyon 2005). This species, referred to by the 
anamorph Diplodina microsperma, has been reported as the most 
abundant endophyte in healthy twigs of Salix fragilis in England 
(Petrini &amp; Fisher 1990) and is thus an important component of the 
host microbiota. Similarly, the closely related species P. dilatatum, 
P. imperceptibile, and P. pulchellum form a black halo or spot on 
the host surface, a feature that may be associated with the early 
stages of canker development. Whether or not these species 
are primarily pathogenic or establish an asymptomatic infection 
that later develops into cankers needs to be determined. These </p>

<p>species form a highly supported monophyletic group (Fig. 1) 
characterised by having an expanded perithecial neck and broad 
ellipsoid to renoid ascospores. This group of species is part of 
a larger, highly supported clade that also includes P. convexum, 
P. ovalisporum, and P. populinum (synonym Cryptodiaporthe 
populea), the pathogen causing a canker of poplars. Plagiostoma 
fraxini causes anthracnose on ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) and 
fringetree (Chionanthus retusis) (Gregory et al. 2004, Sinclair &amp; 
Lyon 2005), and is sister to the clade containing three species on 
Euphorbiaceae. 
Species of Plagiostoma occur on a broad range of host plant 
families within the Eudicots, although most species are associated 
with Rosids. This study shows an association between a clade 
composed of 11 species of Plagiostoma and the host family 
Salicaceae (Fig. 1) especially on the genus Salix. Most of the 
species of Plagiostoma on Salix have expanded necks. These 
findings agree with those for other genera within the Gnomoniaceae 
that are associated primarily with specific host genera in the 
Betulaceae such as Cryptosporella on Alnus and Betula (Mejía et 
al. 2008) and Gnomonia on the Coryloideae (Sogonov et al. 2008). </p>

immersed in bark of stems, branches, and twigs, in midvein or petiole 
of leaves (P. fraxini on leaf lamina), on stalks of herbaceous plants, 
and on peduncles (P. rhododendri). Most species initially appearing as 
conic-shaped or rounded elevations, usually 0.2-0.5 mm high × 1-2 
mm diam, produced where a single perithecium or group of perithecia 
push up host surface from below. Perithecial necks protrude through 
epidermis or periderm making a small hole or slit, with perithecia 
partially or completely exposed by peeling host periderm. In bark, 
perithecia arranged in groups or solitary, scattered, numerous; in 
leaves, perithecia discrete, but growing close together. Stroma scanty, 
flocculose, gray, brownish, cream, yellowish white, or whitish. Perithecia 
black, globose, slightly flattened or suboblate, usually collapsed from 
base when dry, with or without stromatic tissue surrounding neck. Neck

the same, the multigene phylogeny obtained here reveals that P. 
amygdalinae and P. euphorbiaceum are distinct species. Plagiostoma 
amygdalinae occurs on leaves and has a longer and thinner 
perithecial neck, shorter asci, thinner apical ring, and ascospores not 
constricted at septum and thinner than P. euphorbiaceum that occurs 
on twigs, stems, and branches (also see Monod 1983). </p>

<p>Notes: The specimen designated here as lectotype is part of the 
collection of Sphaeria apiculata referred to in the protologue. It 
agrees with Wallroth's description of S. apiculata. Fuckel (1870) 
recircumscribed Sphaeria apiculata Wallr. based on Fungi Rhenani 
918. The original Latin description of Sphaeria apiculata includes 
morphological characters of the perithecia such as an apiculate 
papilla, i.e. "coronatum dilatatis", here interpreted as the disk-
shaped expansion of the perithecial neck, and "nucleo atro" at 
the apex. These morphological characters are present in the type 
specimen BPI 799092 of S. apiculata designated here as the 
lectotype. The protologue of S. apiculata by Wallroth (1833) does 
not include a description of the ascospores, however, the fungus on 
this specimen contains broadly ellipsoid ascospores. This specimen 
and thus Plagiostoma apiculatum is distinctive and differs from 
Plagiostoma salicellum as discussed under that species. 
The concept of the name Sphaeria apiculata has been confused. 
The following is an account of this species and its various synonyms 
based on the results of our study of the original description, type 
specimens, and relevant later specimens. Höhnel (1917), Petrak 
(1921), and later authors considered Sphaeria apiculata to have 
narrowly elongated ascospores while Wehmeyer (1933) recognised 
this species as having broadly ellipsoid ascospores and considered 
Cryptodiaporthe salicina to be a synonym. Höhnel (1917) examined 
specimens made by Rehm, Krieger, and his own of Diaporthe spina 
and considered this name to be a synonym of Sphaeria apiculata. 
He acknowledged differences in perithecial neck length among 
collections of these two species. To determine the synonymy 
of these two species we compared the original description of D. 
spina with the original description of S. apiculata by Wallroth (1833) 
as well as the recircumscription by Fuckel (1870). In his original </p>

<p>description of D. spina Fuckel (1870) provided a drawing that is 
quite unlike the original description of S. apiculata. Based on the 
comparison of descriptions and the specimens observed, we do not 
consider S. apiculata and D. spina to be synonyms. The synonymy 
of these two species proposed by Höhnel (1917) and accepted 
by Petrak's (1921) who provided a description of Cryptodiaporthe 
apiculata (≡ Sphaeria apiculata ) may be the reason that later 
authors considered S. apiculata to be characterised by narrow, 
elongated ascospores as described and observed for D. spina. </p>

<p>Mejía et al. </p>

<p>Notes: Plagiostoma convexum as Sphaeria convexa was 
considered a synonym of Cryptodiaporthe salicina by Wehmeyer 
(1933). Plagiostoma convexum has ascospores that agree with 
those drawn by Wehmeyer (1933 as C. salicina, plate XIII, figs 
3-5). In his description of S. salicina, Currey (1858) mentions 
that the septum in the sporidia (ascospores) is "often very 
difficult to make out", but the ascospores in his drawing have a 
septum. The rest of his description agrees with the description 
of S. convexa. It also agrees with the lectotype specimen of S. 
convexa, BPI 799418 ex. Herb. Brussels with a note on the label 
saying apparently from Preuss). This evidence suggests that S. 
salicina Curr. 1858 and S. convexa Preuss 1852 represent the 
same species. Because S. salicina Curr. is a later homonym 
of Sphaeria salicina Pers. 1796, this basionym cannot be used 
and the next available epithet is S. convexa; hence the correct 
name for this taxon is Plagiostoma convexum. The specimen BPI 
799418 is here designated the lectotype and the specimen BPI 
843490 with the ex-epitype culture CBS 123206 is designated the 
epitype of Sphaeria convexa. 
Wehmeyer (1933) listed 28 synonyms of Cryptodiaporthe 
salicina. Among specimens that Wehmeyer (1933) recognised 
under that name, Butin (1958) elaborated differences in ascospore 
morphology, conidial state, host, and ecological characteristics 
and distinguished three species: C. apiculata (Wallr.) Petr., 
C. populea (Sacc.) Butin, and C. pulchella (Sacc.) Butin, here 
accepted as Plagiostoma apiculatum, P. populinum, and P. 
pulchellum. Butin (1958) did not consider any of these species 
to be conspecific with Sphaeria salicina Curr. On the contrary he 
listed Cryptodiaporthe salicina based on Sphaeria salicina Curr. 
as a synonym of Cryptodiaporthe salicella, here recognised as 
Plagiostoma salicellum. Although Wehmeyer (1933) listed Sphaeria 
sphingiophora Oudem. 1873 [≡ Diaporthe sphingiophora (Oudem.) 
Sacc.] as a synonym of C. salicella, S. sphingiophora occurs on 
Cornus. It is unlikely to be the same species as P. convexum. 
Diaporthe cupulata Berl. &amp; Destrée was considered a synonym of 
Sphaeria convexa by Wehmeyer (1933), however, the ascospore 
sizes of these species are different. We do not consider them to 
be synonymous. The specimen at BPI of Sphaeria salicina Pers., 
Scleromyceti Sueciae 10, was examined and determined to be a 
species of Valsa. </p>

<p>a SySteMatic account of the genuS Plagiostoma </p>

<p>Notes: The application of the name Sphaeria salicella Fr. has been 
the source of confusion and the subject of taxonomic studies since 
the 1800's. It was clearly specified by Fries (1823) that this name 
is typified by Fries : Scleromyceti Sueciae 188 issued in 1821. 
According to Wehmeyer (1933) and Butin (1958) confusion about 
this name was in part due to the fact that different parts of exsiccati 
Scleromyceti Sueciae 188 contain different species. One of the 
two species has the narrowly ellipsoid, elongated ascospores of P. 
salicellum while the other has the broadly ellipsoid ascospores of P. 
apiculatum. Not recognising the confusion regarding Scleromyceti 
Sueciae 188, Petrak (1921) wrongly suggested that S. salicella 
was characterised by having broadly ellipsoid ascospores and 
made a new combination Cryptodiaporthe salicella (Fr.) Petr. in 
addition to the new combination C. apiculata (Wallr.) Petr. based 
on S. apiculata Wallr. The latter species was wrongly considered 
to have narrowly ellipsoid, elongated ascospores. It is not clear if 
Petrak (1921) looked at the type specimen of S. apiculata or if he 
based his conclusions solely on the description of S. apiculata by 
Wallroth (1833). 
Wehmeyer (1933) arrived at a conclusion different from that of 
Petrak (1921). Wehmeyer (1933) studied the exsiccati Scleromyceti 
Sueciae 188 at the Farlow Herbarium and determined that this 
number and hence S. salicella Fr. were characterised by having 
narrowly ellipsoid, elongated ascospores. To use his words, S. 
salicella represents "the narrow-spored species". He synonymised 
S. salicella Fr. with C. apiculata (Wallr.) Petr. and published the 
combination C. salicella (Fr.) Wehm. (1933) non Petrak (1921). In 
addition, Wehmeyer (1933) made the new combination C. salicina 
(Curr.) Wehm. based on S. salicina Curr. for species having broadly 
ellipsoid ascospores (see notes under P. convexum). Later Butin 
(1958) studied species of Cryptodiaporthe on Populus and Salix, 
examined Scleromyceti Sueciae 188 at Uppsala Herbarium, and 
suggested that S. salicella should be understood as the species 
with broadly ellipsoid ascospores and followed Petrak's concept of 
S. salicella. 
We studied the Scleromyceti Sueciae 188 (Sbarbaro collection) 
available at the BPI Herbarium as well as other exsiccati of taxa 
that have been synonymised with S. salicella and C. salicina 
including S. apiculata. In doing so we paid close attention to the 
original descriptions of S. apiculata Wallr. and S. salicella Fr. In 
referring to Scleromyceti Sueciae 188 Fries (1823) described 
S. salicella as having a powdery "albicant" (whitish) stroma and 
that the multiple ostioles are "erumpent simultaneously". The 
specimen of Scleromyceti Sueciae 188 at BPI includes all of these 
morphological characters and has ascospores that are ellipsoid 
elongated (see Fig. 5A, B, D, and G). 
In their treatment of Plagiostoma, Sogonov et al. (2008) made 
the combination Plagiostoma salicellum (Fr.) Sogonov. In our study 
of P. salicellum we noticed that ascospore length and width can 
be quite variable, even within an ascus, but with a prevalence of 
elongated ascospores (Fig. 5A-H). A second specimen, BPI 878975 
from Germany on Salix repens, was sequenced and determined 
to be conspecific with the epitype of P. salicellum within a major 
clade containing two other species having cylindrical ostioles and 
ellipsoid elongated ascospores. Unlike the lectotype and epitype of 
P. salicellium, the ascospores of BPI 878975 are ellipsoid but not 
elongated. In spite of this difference in ascospore morphology, BPI 
878975 is P. salicellum based on the cylindrical perithecial neck 
surrounded by a whitish stroma as well as DNA sequence data. 
In summary Plagiostoma salicellum is characterised by having 
cylindrical perithecial necks surrounded by a whitish stroma and 
ascospores predominantly ellipsoid-elongated, less commonly </p>

<p>ellipsoid, tapering to slightly acute, rounded ends (Fig. 5D-G), 
unlike P. apiculatum that has oblong ellipsoid to renoid, broadly 
rounded ascospores (Fig. 2H-J). </p>

<p>Plagiostoma arnstadtiense (Auersw.) M. Monod, Beihefte 
Sydowia 9: 143. 1983. </p>

<p>Basionym: Gnomonia arnstadtiensis Auersw. in Gonnerm. &amp; 
Robenh., Mycol. Europ. 5/6: 22. 1869. </p>

<p>Notes: This species is now accepted in Gnomonia according to 
Sogonov et al. (2008). </p>

<p>Plagiostoma bavaricum (Rehm) M.E. Barr, Mycol. Mem. 7: 
112. 1978. </p>

<p>Basionym: Hypospila bavarica Rehm, Ann. Mycol. 6:322. 1908. </p>

<p>Note: Based on an LSU sequence, this species belongs in the 
Gnomoniaceae but it cannot be placed in a genus. </p>

<p>Culture sequenced: Switzerland, on Acer opalus, M. Monod, 
CBS 772.79. </p>

<p>Plagiostoma conradii (Ellis) M.E. Barr, Mycol. Mem. 7: 107. 
1978. </p>

<p>Basionym: Diaporthe conradii Ellis, Am. Nat. 17: 316. 1883. </p>

<p>Notes: A fresh specimen determined to be this species was cultured 
and sequenced. Analysis of the LSU sequence suggests this species 
is closely related to Cryptodiaporthe aubertii and Cryptosporella but 
not within any known genus in the Gnomoniaceae. The perithecial 
neck of this species is lateral and upright. </p>

<p>Specimen examined: USA, New Jersey, on living stems of Hudsonia tomentosa, G. 
Bills, BPI 746482, culture CBS 109761 = AR 3488. </p>

<p>Plagiostoma inclinatum (Auersw.) M.E. Barr, Mycol. Mem. 
7: 115. 1978. </p>

<p>Basionym: Gnomonia inclinata Auersw. in Rabenh., Mycol. Europ. 
5/6: 27. 1869. </p>

<p>[≡ Sphaeria inclinata Desm., Ann. Sci. Nat. Bot. III, 16: 315. 1851 non 
Schwein. 1832] </p>

<p>Notes: Two isolates of this species were sequenced. This species 
apparently belongs in the Gnomoniaceae but it cannot be placed 
in a genus. </p>

<p>Cultures sequenced: The Netherlands, on dead leaf of Acer 
pseudoplatanus, CBS 209.67. Switzerland, on Acer platanoides, 
M. Monod, CBS 830.79. </p>

<p>Plagiostoma jensenii M.E. Barr, Mycotaxon 41: 298. 1991. </p>

<p>Note: Based on the lack of a perithecial neck and the pulvinate 
appendages on the ascospores, P. jensenii most likely does not 
belong in Plagiostoma. </p>

<p>Plagiostoma lugubre (P. Karst.) Bolay, Ber. Schweiz. Bot. 
Ges. 81: 436. 1972. </p>

<p>Basionym: Gnomonia lugubris P. Karst., Bidr. Känn. Finl. Nat. Folk 
23: 121. 1873. </p>

<p>Note: The disposition of this species was not investigated in this 
study. </p>

<p>Plagiostoma magnoliae (Ellis) M.E. Barr, Mycol. Mem. 7: 
117. 1978. </p>

<p>Basionym: Gnomonia magnoliae Ellis, Amer. Nat. 17: 318. 1883. </p>

<p>Notes: This species has been reported in leaves of Magnolia 
virginiana in North America. The perithecial neck of this species 
is lateral and obliquely upright as drawn by Barr (1978). The 
disposition of this species was not investigated in this study. </p>

<p>Plagiostoma micromegalum (Ellis &amp; Everh.) M.E. Barr, 
Mycol. Mem. 7: 112. 1978. </p>

<p>Basionym: Diaporthe micromegala Ellis &amp; Everh., Proc. Acad. Nat. 
Sci. Philadelphia 1893: 449. 1894. </p>

<p>Notes: This species is now placed in Ophiognomonia as O. 
micromegala (Ellis &amp; Everh.) Sogonov according to Sogonov et al. 
(2008). </p>

<p>Plagiostoma petrakii (E. Müll.) M. Monod, Beihefte Sydowia 
9: 146. 1983. </p>

<p>Basionym: Plagiostigme petrakii E. Müll., Sydowia 18:90. 1965. </p>

<p>Note: No material of this species was located. </p>

<p>Plagiostoma pseudobavaricum M. Monod, Beihefte 
Sydowia 9: 151. 1983. </p>

<p>Notes: ITS sequences of this species were included in a 
phylogenetic analysis. Although closely related to Apiognomonia 
and Plagiostoma, the results suggest that this species may 
represent an undescribed genus within the Gnomoniaceae. </p>

<p>Specimens examined: USA, New York, Adirondack Mts., Cranberry Lake, on 
petioles of Acer sp., 22 Jun. 2002, L. Vasilyeva, BPI 843494, ex culture AR 3819; 
ibid., 23 Jun. 2002, L. Vasilyeva, BPI 843495, ex culture AR 3894; Tennessee, 
Sevier Co., Great Smokey Mountains National Park, on overwintered petioles of 
Acer saccharum, 22 May 2006, M.V. Sogonov MS 0483, BPI 877700. </p>

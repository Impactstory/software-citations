<p>Background/Aims 
There are few reports on the correlation between chewing gum and the gastrointestinal functions. But previous report showed 
use of chewing gum to be an effective method for controlling gastrointestinal symptoms. The aim of this study was to de-
termine the correlation between chewing gum and gastric emptying using the continuous real time 
13 C breath test (BreathID 
system). </p>

<p>Methods 
Ten healthy male volunteers participated in this randomized, 2-way crossover study. The subjects fasted overnight and were 
randomly assigned to chewing gum (Xylish, 2-3/1 tablet) for an hour following intake of a test meal (200 kcal/200 mL) or 
intake of the test meal alone. Gastric emptying was monitored for 4 hours after administration of the test meal by the 
13 C-acetic acid breath test performed continually using the BreathID system. </p>

<p>Results 
No significant differences in the calculated parameters, namely, T1/2 (median, 111.82 vs 109.26 minutes; P = 0.575), Tlag 
(median, 53.28 vs 56.53 minutes; P = 0.333), gastric emptying coefficient (median, 3.58 vs 3.65; P = 0.285), regression-esti-
mated constant β (median, 1.85 vs 1.80; P = 0.575) and regression-estimated constant κ (median, 0.61 vs 0.62; P = 0.959) 
were observed between the test meal alone group and the test meal and chewing gum group. </p>

<p>Conclusions 
This study showed that chewing gum had no effect on the rate of gastric emptying. Therefore, since chewing gum did not 
enhance the speed of gastric emptying, it may ameliorate gastrointestinal symptoms through other mechanisms, such as saliva 
and autonomic nervous system.

<p>In Japan, use of chewing gum has prevailed ever since World 
War II. There are few reports on the correlation between chew-
ing gum and the gastrointestinal functions. 
But, the previous study showed that consistently chewing 
gum increased the esophageal and pharyngeal pH. 
1 According to </p>

<p>another study, chewing gum increased the salivary flow rate and 
controlled acid reflux and the related symptoms. 
2 Gastric empty-</p>

<p>ing may cause retention of solid foods, gastric distention, re-
sultant increase of gastric acid secretion and transient lower 
esophageal sphincter relaxation. 
3,4 We hypothesized that chewing </p>

<p>gum may increase chewing activity, saliva production, gastric 
motility and thereby accelerate the rate of gastric emptying. 
In this study, we investigated the physiologic effect of chew-
ing gum on the rate of gastric emptying using a continuous re-
al-time </p>

<p>Subjects </p>

<p>The subjects were 10 asymptomatic male volunteers, none of 
whom were habitual drinkers. None had a history of gastro-
intestinal disease or abdominal surgery, and all were non-
smokers. None of the subjects were on any routine medication at 
the time of the study. The study was conducted in accordance 
with the declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol using the 
BreathID system was approved by the Ethics Committee of 
Yokohama City University School of Medicine. </p>

<p>13 C-Acetic Acid Breath Test </p>

<p>Ten subjects participated in this randomized, 2-way cross-
over study. They were randomly assigned to receive a test meal 
and a chewing gum (Xylish, Meiji Seika, Tokyo, Japan; 1 pack 
[17 g/12 tablets] include: carbon 13.5 g, xylitol 6.7 g, 36 kcal, 
protein 0 g, lipid 0.1 g, Na 0 mg and sugar 0 g), or only a test 
meal. The 2 tests were conducted as follows; (1) experiment A: 
the subjects chewed gum for an hour just minutes after intake of 
test meal and (2) experiment B: the subjects only took a test meal 
without chewing gum. The 2 tests were conducted separately 
with a washout period of at least 7 days according to previous 
reports. 
6-10 In both the experiments, the tests were started after </p>

<p>the patients had fasted overnight (at least 8 hours), and the breath 
test was performed while the subjects were seated. 
The test meal was a 200 kcal/200 mL liquid meal (Racol with 
milk flavor, Otsuka Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan; 1 pack [200 
mL] include protein 8.76 g, fat 4.46 g and carbon 31.24 g) con-
taining 100 mg of </p>

<p>13 </p>

<p>C-acetic acid (Cambridge Isotope Laborato-
ries, Boston, MA, USA), 
5-16 which the patients were requested to </p>

<p>consume within 5 minutes. This protocol was Japanese stand-
ardized method by Japan society of smooth muscle research. </p>

<p>5-9 </p>

<p>After the meal intake, the subjects, participating in experiment A 
were asked to chew 2-3 chewing gums for an hour. On the other 
hand, the subjects participating in experiment B took the breath 
test without chewing gum after the meal intake. Breath samples 
were continuously collected via a nasal tube using the BreathID 
system (Exalenz Bioscience Ltd) at baseline before the test meal 
and following completion of the test meal ingestion (time 0) for 
up to 4 hours. </p>

<p>After mathematical analysis, the time required for the emptying 
of 50% of the labeled meals (T 1/2 ), the analog to the scintigraphy 
lag time for 10% emptying of the labeled meal (T lag ), the gastric 
emptying coefficient (GEC), and β and κ were calculated. A 
larger (smaller) β indicates slower (faster) emptying in the early 
phase, and a larger (smaller) κ indicates faster (slower) emptying 
in the later phase. </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>These study examined changes in the rate of gastric emptying 
during the first 4 hours after gum chewing for an hour in healthy 
subjects. 
The </p>

<p>13 </p>

<p>C-acetic acid breath test is a noninvasive and well-es-
tablished test for measuring the rate of gastric emptying of liquid 
meals and has been shown to be significantly correlated with the 
results of scintigraphy. 
5-16 The subject ingests </p>

<p>13 </p>

<p>C-labeled acetic 
acid, which passes through the stomach and is absorbed into the </p>

<p>duodenum and upper small bowel. The </p>

<p>13 </p>

<p>C-labeled acetic acid is 
then metabolized in the liver and excreted from the lung as </p>

<p>13 </p>

<p>CO 2 . This pathway enables gastric emptying to be measured in 
a noninvasive manner. </p>

<p>5-21 </p>

<p>The BreathID system allows continuous evaluation of gastric 
emptying. For patients, it can serve as a real-time breath analysis. 
It also decreases the examination time and alleviates patient 
discomfort. Continuous analysis also provides quick, immediate 
results. </p>

<p>5-13 </p>

<p>We hypothesized that chewing of gum increases the chewing 
activity, saliva production, gastric motility, thereby accelerating 
the rate of gastric emptying. However, in this study, chewing 
gum did not affect the rate of gastric emptying. We were not able 
to demonstrate why chewing gum did not affect the rate of gastric 
emptying. Our results could be related to the form of our test 
meals, the volume of meals, the starting time of chewing gum and 
the duration of chewing. 
In this study, we used a 200 kcal/200 mL liquid meal (Racol 
with milk flavor, Otsuka Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan; 1 pack 
[200 mL] include protein 8.76 g, fat 4.46 g and carbon 31.24 g) 
as the test meal. 
5-16 Although this protocol was Japanese stand-</p>

<p>ardized method by Japan society of smooth muscle research, </p>

<p>5-9 </p>

<p>the protocol was not used in major studies for reasons of small 
volume, light calorie and liquid meal. In Japan, we usually chew 
gum before meal or after heavy rich meal. We should research 
during fasting status or after heavy test meal. 
The previous study showed that gum chewing consistently 
increased the esophageal and pharyngeal pH. 
1 According to an-</p>

<p>other study, when gastroesophageal reflux occurs, the refluxate 
volume and acid clearance from the esophagus depend on 2 ma-
jor mechanisms. Peristalsis initiates esophageal clearance, and 
swallowed saliva neutralizes the residual acid. 
2 A common dietary </p>

<p>stimulant for the production of saliva is chewing gum. Chewing 
gum increases the salivary flow rate. 
2 Use of chewing gum has </p>

<p>been shown as a comparatively safe and effective method of con-
trolling acid reflux and the related symptoms. 
2 Various type of </p>

<p>foods has been shown to promote reflux either by decreasing the 
lower esophageal sphincter pressure, stimulating gastric secretion 
or noxiously interacting directly with the oesophageal mucosa. </p>

<p>3 </p>

<p>Over time, gastric emptying may cause retention of solid foods, 
gastric distention, resultant increase of gastric acid secretion and 
transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation. 
3,4 Therefore, the </p>

<p>esophageal and pharyngeal pH values are increased after chew-
ing. 
Sugar content has been suggested to influence the osmotic </p>

<p>detector in the duodenum and delayed gastric emptying. Howev-
er in this study, the chewing gum used as the test food contained 
little sugar. 
The parasympathetic activity is reduced in patients who are 
unable to masticate and swallow food, resulting in adverse effects 
on the gastric motor and excretion functions. Mastication and 
swallowing not only prepare food for passage from the oral cavity 
into the esophagus, but are also important in terms of subsequent 
events that occur in the stomach. It has been proposed that auto-</p>

<p>nomic nervous activity might be involved in mastication and 
swallowing. 
22,23 Therefore, we thought that chewing of gum </p>

<p>might accelerate gastric emptying. We guess that the form of test 
meals, their volume, the starting time of chewing gum, duration 
of chewing, gum volume and the relatively small number of sub-
jects might have influenced the results of our study. 
Lunding suggested that in functional dyspepsia patients, but 
not healthy volunteers, the motility index increased and intra-
gastric volume tended to increase following sham feeding.

rate of gastric emptying. </p>

<p>functional dyspepsia patients, vagal stimulation by sham feeding 
improved the antral motility in response to a soup meal. Similar 
results were obtained in healthy volunteers, such as in our study. 
In conclusion, our study showed that chewing of gum had no 
significant effect on the rate of gastric emptying. The physio-
logical implications of our results remain unclear, and further in-
vestigation is needed. </p>

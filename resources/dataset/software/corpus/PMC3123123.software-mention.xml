<p>The histone H3 variant CENP-A is the most favored candidate 
for an epigenetic mark that specifies the centromere. In fission 
yeast, adjacent heterochromatin can direct CENP-A 
Cnp1 chro-
matin establishment, but the underlying features governing 
where CENP-A 
Cnp1 chromatin assembles are unknown. We 
show that, in addition to centromeric regions, a low level of 
CENP-A 
Cnp1 associates with gene promoters where histone 
H3 is depleted by the activity of the Hrp1 
Chd1 chromatin-
remodeling factor. Moreover, we demonstrate that noncod-
ing RNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) 
from CENP-A 
Cnp1 chromatin at centromeres. These analyses 
reveal a similarity between centromeres and a subset of RNA-
PII genes and suggest a role for remodeling at RNAPII pro-
moters within centromeres that influences the replacement 
of histone H3 with CENP-A 
Cnp1 . </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>Hrp1 
Chd1 has previously been implicated in CENP-A </p>

<p>Cnp1 </p>

<p>deposition but is not essential for cell viability (12). Expression 
of RNAPII-transcribed marker genes such as arg3 
ϩ is repressed 
when placed within the central domain, and silencing of cen1: 
arg3 
ϩ is highly sensitive to defective CENP-A 
Cnp1 deposition 
(17); however, this silencing is only partially impaired in hrp1⌬ 
cells (Fig. 1A). This suggests that redundant mechanisms oper-
ate to ensure CENP-A 
Cnp1 deposition in the absence of 
Hrp1 
Chd1 . In agreement with this and previous analyses (12), 
when hrp1⌬ was combined with the mis6-302 temperature-
sensitive mutation (defective in CENP-A 
Cnp1 deposition), it 
reduced the restrictive temperature of mis6-302. Furthermore, 
hrp1⌬ also reduced the restrictive temperature of cnp1-87, a 
weak temperature-sensitive allele (Fig. 1B) (18). Consistent 
with this, the levels of CENP-A 
Cnp1 associated with the central 
domain were further reduced in hrp1⌬ cnp1-87 double mutants 
compared with either single mutant (Fig. 1C). We conclude that 
Hrp1 facilitates the assembly of CENP-A 
Cnp1 chromatin, and it 
becomes essential when Mis6 or CENP-A 
Cnp1 function is 
impaired. 
Genome-wide analyses of CENP-A 
Cnp1 and histone H3 
localization by ChIP on tiling arrays with anti-CENP-A </p>

<p>Cnp1 </p>

<p>and anti-H3 antibodies confirmed that Hrp1 
Chd1 is required 
to maintain normal levels of CENP-A 
Cnp1 and that, in hrp1⌬ 
cells, H3 levels increase across the central domain (Fig. 1D 
and supplemental Fig. S1). Previously, we have shown that 
Hrp1 
Chd1 acts at a subset of gene promoters to disassemble 
histone H3-containing nucleosomes close to the transcrip-
tion start sites (16). Further examination of the genome-
wide analyses revealed that low but detectable levels of 
CENP-A 
Cnp1 associate with a significant proportion of pro-
moters in wild-type cells at which Hrp1 
Chd1 acts to disassem-
ble H3-containing nucleosomes (Fig. 2A). CENP-A 
Cnp1 asso-
ciation is significantly reduced at some, but not all, of these 
promoters in hrp1⌬ cells, and in agreement with this, we saw 
an increase in H3 (p ϭ 2.7e 
Ϫ4 , hypergeometric probability) 
(Fig. 2, B and C). Some promoters show an increase in CENP-
A 
Cnp1 association and a decrease in H3 in hrp1⌬ cells; how-
ever, this is less significant (Fig. 2D). These analyses imply 
that Hrp1 
Chd1 directly participates in a remodeling process 
that evicts H3 and allows CENP-A 
Cnp1 deposition at the pro-
moters of some genes. However, additional factors, such as 
Scm3, must also contribute to the replacement of H3 with 
CENP-A 
Cnp1 and/or CENP-A 
Cnp1 maintenance at centrom-
eres (19, 20). This bears resemblance to the transcription-
coupled replacement of H3.1 with H3.3 in metazoa (21) and 
suggests that remodeling at some promoters of RNAPII </p>

<p>genes is intimately associated with the destabilization of 
H3-containing nucleosomes to encourage the assembly of 
CENP-A </p>

<p>Cnp1   chromatin. Nucleosome replacement in 
S. cerevisiae is more prominent at promoters than within 
coding regions (22), and the genome-wide effects of 
Hrp1 
Chd1 on H3 eviction in fission yeast are more pro-
nounced at promoters compared with coding regions and 
3Ј-intergenic regions (16), accounting for the preferential 
association of CENP-A 
Cnp1 with the promoters of genes at 
which Hrp1 
Chd1 functions. 
The close correlation between CENP-A 
Cnp1 association 
and Hrp1 
Chd1 function at gene promoters as well as at cen-
tromeres raises the possibility that centromeric DNA may 
contain promoters for hitherto unidentified transcription 
elements. It is well established that transcripts are produced 
from the heterochromatic outer repeats of fission yeast cen-
tromeres and processed by the RNAi pathway (23, 24). To 
determine whether the central kinetochore domain is also 
transcribed, RT-PCR was performed with primer pairs 
(PP1-PP10) complementary to centromere 1 (cen1) (Fig. 
3A). PP1-PP3 detect part of the outer repeat heterochro-
matic transcript. PP4 flanks the tRNA 
Ala /tRNA 
Glu genes, 
whereas PP5-PP10 lie within the central subkinetochore 
domain. In wild-type cells, heterochromatic transcripts were 
detected in a region immediately adjacent to the outer 
repeats (PP1 and PP2), but transcripts were not apparent in 
the central domain (Fig. 3B). Outer repeat transcripts are 
known to accumulate in mutants defective in RNAi or het-
erochromatin integrity (23, 24). Several studies in S. cerevi-
siae indicate that aberrant or cryptic transcripts are 
degraded by 5Ј-3Ј-and/or 3Ј-5Ј-exoribonucleases; 3Ј-end 
processing can contribute to RNA stability (25). Indeed, in 
fission yeast, outer repeat heterochromatin transcript levels 
are also regulated by the exosome (26 -28). We therefore 
tested whether conditional mutations in Pfs2 (pfs2-11 tem-
perature-sensitive; polyadenylation factor I subunit 2) (29), 
Dhp1 (dhp1-1 temperature-sensitive; 5Ј-3Ј-exoribonu-
clease orthologous to Xrn2/Rat1) (30), or Dis3 (dis3-54 cold-
sensitive; 3Ј-5Ј-exoribonuclease component of the exo-
some) (27) allow accumulation of RNA homologous to the 
central domain. Transcripts from the central domain were 
clearly detected with PP5, PP6, PP7, PP9, and PP10 in 
dhp1-1, pfs2-11, and dis3-54 cells, but not in wild-type cells, 
under restrictive conditions (36 or 18°C) (Fig. 3B). We con-
clude that a large proportion of the central domain is tran-
scribed but that the resulting transcripts are normally unde-
tectable due to their rapid turnover. RT-PCR also detected 
transcripts homologous to the central domains of cen2 and 
cen3 in dis3-54 cells (Fig. 3C). Thus, transcription of subkin-
etochore chromatin is a general property of the three cen-
tromeres, and these transcripts from under kinetochores 
(TUKs) are normally degraded by the exosome. 
Northern analyses with an RNA probe specific for the cen1 
central domain confirmed the presence of TUKs; no obvious 
signal was observed in wild-type cells, but a smear of transcripts 
was detected in RNA-processing mutants (pfs2-11, dhp1-1, and 
dis3-54) (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S2). We also examined 
the temperature-sensitive mutants mis6-302 and cnp1-1, </p>

<p>which have reduced levels of CENP-A 
Cnp1 chromatin over 
the central domain (31, 32). Surprisingly, transcripts with 
discrete sizes (ϳ0.5 kb) were identified in both mutants (Fig. 
4A); these discrete transcripts (discrete TUKs) were highly 
enriched in poly(A)-selected RNA (Fig. 4B). A lower level of 
these specific transcripts was also enriched in the poly(A) 
fraction from dis3-54 (Fig. 4B, arrowhead). Dis3 is the key 
catalytic subunit of the exosome required to degrade aber-
rant transcripts, whereas Pfs2 and Dhp1 are required for </p>

<p>normal 3Ј-end formation/termination (27, 29, 30). pfs2-11 
and dhp1-1 may generate transcripts with extended 3Ј-ends 
due to transcriptional read-through into downstream 
regions, resulting in the observed heterogeneous smear of 
transcripts (Fig. 4, A and B). The specific increase in discrete 
TUKs observed in mis6-302 and cnp1-1 cells could be inter-
preted to mean that intact CENP-A 
Cnp1 chromatin prevents 
expression of these transcripts; however, our analyses sug-
gest that TUKs are constitutively produced and turned over </p>

<p>by the exosome in wild-type cells. The chromatin context in 
mis6-302 and cnp1-1 cells is dramatically altered from 
CENP-A 
Cnp1 to H3 chromatin; CENP-A 
Cnp1 chromatin may 
interfere with events required for the formation of specific 
transcripts, such as accurate 3Ј-termination, ensuring their 
turnover. Using RNA probes complementary to either 
reverse or forward strands of the cen1 central core (cc1/tm1) 
(supplemental Fig. S2), we detected other discrete tran-
scripts in distinct central domain regions in poly(A) RNA 
from cnp1-1 cells (Fig. 4, C and D). To identify the 5Ј-ends of 
these central domain noncoding transcripts, we employed 
5Ј-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)/PCR on 
5Ј-capped poly(A) RNA extracted from wild-type and cnp1-1 
cells. This demonstrated that these novel/unusual tran-
scripts are produced from within the central domain and do 
not arise by read-through from outer repeat transcripts (Fig. 
4E and supplemental Fig. S3). The high sensitivity of 
5Ј-RACE/PCR allowed the detection of transcripts in wild-
type cells with some primers (Fig. 4E, black arrows, and sup-
plemental Fig. S3). The transcription start sites for these 
transcripts were identical in wild-type and cnp1-1 cells, sug-
gesting that they are indeed produced from wild-type cen-
tromeres, albeit at a lower level. The fact that these tran-
scripts are 5Ј-capped and polyadenylated indicates that 
TUKs are produced by RNAPII. Consistent with alterations </p>

<p>in central domain chromatin affecting transcription (lower 
CENP-A 
Cnp1 and higher H3 deposition) (Fig. 1D), increased 
levels of the central domain transcript were also detectable 
in hrp1⌬ cells (supplemental Fig. S4). 
On the basis of the 5Ј-RACE analyses above, we designed 
improved probes for Northern analyses to detect the forward 
and reverse strands of the cen1 central core (cc1/tm1) (sup-
plemental Fig. S2) in additional mutants known to affect 
kinetochore integrity (mis12-537, mis16-53, and mis18-262 
in addition to mis6-302 and cnp1-1) (6). At 36°C, transcripts 
were detected in all mutants apart from mis12-537 with this 
TM-forward 
5 probe (Fig. 4F). Some transcripts were even 
detectable in mis6-302, cnp1-1, and mis16-53 at 25°C, the 
permissive temperature. In all mutants, including mis12-
537, this TM-reverse probe allowed detection of other tran-
scripts (Fig. 4G) in addition to those observed with the orig-
inal probe (Fig. 4D). Together, these analyses indicate that 
cryptic transcription is prevalent in the central kinetochore 
domain of fission yeast centromeres and revealed only in 
cells defective in RNA turnover or formation of subkineto-
chore chromatin. In support of this, low levels of H3K4 </p>

<p>methylation, a modification associated with active transcrip-
tion, have been shown to be enriched in the small amount of 
histone H3 that remains within subkinetochore chromatin 
in wild-type cells (33). </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>Centromere-associated DNA has been shown to be tran-
scribed in plants and vertebrates (7, 10). 30 years ago, EM 
studies demonstrated the presence of RNase-sensitive mate-
rial at the base of kinetochore microtubules in newt lung 
cells (34). Since then, centromeric transcripts have been 
found to associate with kinetochore proteins (9, 10). In this 
study, we demonstrated an analogy between the central 
domain-associated CENP-A 
Cnp1 chromatin of centromeres 
and genes whose promoters are associated with Hrp1 
Chd1 in 
fission yeast. The fact that Hrp1 
Chd1 promotes eviction of 
histone H3 at a set of promoters suggests that similar remod-
eling processes may occur at RNAPII promoters within cen-
tromeres and may contribute to exchange of canonical 
H3-containing nucleosomes for CENP-A 
Cnp1 -containing 
nucleosomes (summarized in Fig. 5). 
It is possible that transcription within centromeres occurs 
merely as a consequence of having RNAPII promoters whose 
presence or activation is critical to act as a seed for remod-
eling events that promote CENP-A 
Cnp1 deposition. The 
resulting TUK transcripts are degraded by the exosome and 
thus may represent just nonfunctional by-products of tran-</p>

<p>scription. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that 
these unstable transcripts might also have a dedicated func-
tion in guiding some components of the CENP-A 
Cnp1 depo-
sition machineries and/or kinetochore complex to their cog-
nate DNA sequences (10). Alternatively, the production of 
TUKs might influence chromatin modification within cen-
tromeric chromatin by processes analogous to those associ-
ated with cryptic or antisense noncoding RNA production in 
S. cerevisiae (35, 36). However, we found that the accumula-
tion of TUKs in pfs2-11, dhp1-1, or dis3-54 cells had no 
obvious effect on CENP-A 
Cnp1 chromatin formation.

also conceivable that these transcripts are processed into a

gous to how siRNAs derived from outer repeat transcripts

of small RNAs corresponding to the central domain of 
centromeres. </p>

<p>5   Intriguingly, it has recently been reported that S. cerevi-
siae CENP-A

RNAPII promoters where RNAPII binding is high (37); how-

<p>meres that contribute to CENP-A 
Cse4 deposition. Interest-
ingly, the S. cerevisiae centromeric protein Cbf1, which 
binds centromere DNA element I, functions as a transcrip-
tion factor at the MET16 promoter (38). In this regard, it is 
possible that RNAPII transcription might also occur within 
or close to centromeres of S. cerevisiae. In fact, cryptic tran-
scription was detected close to CEN3 in S. cerevisiae exo-
some mutants (39); it is not known if this is a general feature </p>

<p>of all S. cerevisiae centromeres. Recently, the human chro-
matin-remodeling factor FACT (facilitates chromatin tran-
scription), whose function is implicated in transcription, was 
found to associate with affinity-purified CENP-A chromatin 
(40, 41) Moreover, depletion of FACT was found to impair 
incorporation of newly synthesized CENP-A in chicken cells 
(42). CHD1 was also found at centromeres in chicken cells

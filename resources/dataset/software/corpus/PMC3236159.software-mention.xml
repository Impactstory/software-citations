variability, lowered power, and statistical effect. Additionally, 
there was no consistent gold standard to which volume overload 
was measured, making this study extremely hard to analyze 
quantitatively when compared to VPW values. 
A funnel plot is designed to check the existence of 
publication bias in meta-analysis. Studies with publication bias 
usually obtain an asymmetric funnel plot. 30 We did funnel plots 
on both erect and supine mean VPW (data not shown). Our 
results showed that the supine VPW measurement has less 
publication bias than did the erect VPW measurement. 
However, publication bias is only one of the possible 
explanations for funnel plot asymmetry. Factors that can affect 
the funnel plot asymmetry include but are not limited to 
language bias, citation bias, the size of effect differing 
according to study size, and poor methodological design of 
small studies, etc. 31,32 As a result of the limited data, this meta-
analysis included both prospective and retrospective studies. In 
the erect VPW group, there are only 2 small studies included, 
which could significantly affect the results and cause an 
asymmetric funnel plot. 
Studies that reported only cut-off VPW values chosen from 
receiver operating characteristic curves are not included in this 
meta-analysis as a result of lack of VPW mean and SD 
values. 11,20-24 This could result in eschewed data and poor 
meta-analysis due to incomplete enrollment of all studies. In 
addition, although bigger VPW values correlated with higher 
PAOP, wider inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter, higher LAEF, 
and worsening total circulating blood volume, because of the 
limited numbers of subjects enrolled, no large validation studies 
were performed individually. 33-51 </p>

<p>DISCUSSION 
The data from this meta-analysis report VPW values from 
both erect and supine CR techniques that support the 
correlation between volume overload and increased VPW 
measurements. 11,12,33-35 Prior studies were limited by small 
sample size, varying VPW measurements, and CR technique 
(supine and erect). VPW was initially described using 72-inch 
erect periapical radiographs. However, supine CRs are 
commonly performed in critically ill patients using a portable 
radiograph machine. Thus, it is critical to address the difference 
in VPW values based on the position of the patient for CR. 
VPW measured 11 on supine CRs in normal volunteers 
increased by 17% as a result of gravity. In addition, VPW 
values can be altered by respiratory effects or by subjects' 
previous medical problems, especially cardiovascular 
diseases. 11 For these reasons, the accuracy of VPW 
measurements on supine CR and its correlation with volume 
status has been questioned. 
Four studies included in this meta-analysis used the supine 
CR technique for VPW measurements on subjects in the 
intensive care unit setting. Mean VPW values on supine CRs 
were significantly larger than in erect CRs (62 mm vs 71 mm, Q 
¼ 77.3, P , 0.001). Analysis of statistical heterogeneity is done 
using the Q statistic, which is a measure of the variability 
among studies related to the outcome variable. We chose the 
results from the random effect model on VPW value since the 
heterogeneity is presented (P , 0.001). In contrast, results of 
correlation coefficient from fixed-effects model are used 
because no statistically significant difference was found 
between studies (Q ¼ 0.06, P . 0.05). Our results indicate that 
different VPW cut-off values need to be considered when using </p>

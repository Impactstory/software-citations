<p>Background: The aim of the present study was to identify chromosomal loci that contribute to the pathogenesis of 
aortic dissection (AD) in a Korean population using array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and to confirm 
the results using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Materials and Methods: Eighteen patients with ADs 
were enrolled in this study. Genomic DNA was extracted from individual blood samples, and array CGH analyses 
were performed. Four corresponding genes with obvious genomic changes were analyzed using real-time PCR in 
order to assess the level of genomic imbalance identified by array CGH. Results: Genomic gains were most fre-
quently detected at 8q24.3 (56%), followed by regions 7q35, 11q12.2, and 15q25.2 (50%). Genomic losses were 
most frequently observed at 4q35.2 (56%). Real-time PCR confirmed the results of the array CGH studies of the 
COL6A2, DGCR14, PCSK6, and SDHA genes. Conclusion: This is the first study to identify candidate regions by 
array CGH in patients with ADs. The identification of genes that may predispose an individual to AD may lead to 
a better understanding of the mechanism of AD formation. Further multicenter studies comparing cohorts of patients 
of different ethnicities are warranted. </p>

<p>Aortic dissection (AD) is an uncommon but highly lethal </p>

<p>disease that leads to the gradual deterioration of the mechan-</p>

<p>ical properties of the aortic wall. It is caused by weak aortic </p>

<p>structure, incompetent repair mechanisms and powerful de-</p>

<p>structive forces. Although genetic factors may play an im-</p>

<p>portant role in the pathogenesis of AD [1-3], studies inves-</p>

<p>tigating the genetic determinants of AD have been superficial, </p>

<p>and reports of genetic risk factors for AD in Koreans are ex-</p>

<p>tremely rare. 
Several chromosomal loci with evidence of linkage were </p>

<p>found in studies of thoracic aortic diseases [4-6], but the </p>

<p>mode of genetic transmission for AD remains uncertain. The </p>

<p>identification of genetic markers associated with an increased </p>

<p>risk of AD formation and growth will improve the treatment </p>

<p>outcomes of patients with AD. </p>

<p>powerful technique, allowing the simultaneous quantitative </p>

<p>analysis of entire genomes, including a higher resolution, more </p>

<p>dynamic range, direct mapping of aberrations to genomic se-</p>

<p>quences, and higher throughput [7,8]. Therefore, array CGH </p>

<p>has been used to detect chromosomal aberrations in mental </p>

<p>retardation, epilepsy, and schizophrenia [9-12]. Real-time pol-</p>

<p>ymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used to empirically </p>

<p>confirm the results of array CGH [13,14]. Moreover, quantita-</p>

<p>tive real-time PCR has great advantages in measuring DNA </p>

<p>copy-number changes owing to the economy, simplicity, and </p>

<p>flexibility of the technique [15]. 
The aim of the present study was to identify possible chro-</p>

<p>mosomal loci associated with the pathogenesis of AD in </p>

<p>Koreans using array CGH and to confirm the results with re-</p>

<p>al-time PCR. </p>

<p>MATERIALS AND METHODS </p>

<p>1) Patient population </p>

<p>A total of 18 patients with ADs were recruited from the </p>

<p>single hospital. The mean age of the patients was 54.17 </p>

<p>years, ranging from 41 to 77 years. The demographic data </p>

<p>and range of aortic pathologic disease are summarized in </p>

<p>Table 1. Genomic DNA was extracted from individual blood </p>

<p>samples using the Puregene DNA isolation kit (Qiagen, </p>

<p>Hilden, Germany). Reference DNA was pooled from ten gen-</p>

<p>der-matched (male), normal, healthy control subjects. Approval </p>

<p>was obtained from the institutional review board of the </p>

<p>College of Medicine of our university, and informed consent </p>

<p>was provided according to the Declaration of Helsinki. </p>

<p>2) Array-CGH analysis </p>

<p>Array-CGH analyses were conducted on 18 individual </p>

<p>samples. Array CGH was performed as described previously </p>

<p>[16] using a commercial MACArray TM -Karyo 4K BAC-chip </p>

<p>(Macrogen, Seoul, Korea) with 4,030 bacterial artificial chro-</p>

<p>mosome (BAC) clones duplicating the whole human genome </p>

<p>with a resolution of 1 Mbp. DNA was labeled using the </p>

<p>BioPrime labeling kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Each DNA </p>

<p>(target and reference DNA) sample (500∼700 ng) with ran-</p>

<p>dom primers was boiled at 98∼100 o C for 5 min for denatu-</p>

<p>ration and then cooled on ice for 5 min. The denatured DNA </p>

<p>was differentially labeled with 3μL of 1 mM Cy3-dCTP </p>

<p>(references DNA), Cy5-dCTP (Target DNA), respectively </p>

<p>(PerkinElmer, Boston, MA), and 1μL Klenow fragments </p>

<p>were added to the mixture (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). DNA </p>

<p>was incubated at 37 o C overnight for labeling. Subsequently, </p>

<p>unincorporated nucleotides were removed using MicroSpin </p>

<p>G-50 columns (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, </p>

<p>England). Cy3 and Cy5 labeled DNA (Target DNA and refer-</p>

<p>ence DNA, repectively) was mixed with 50μg of human </p>

<p>Cot-1 DNA for blocking of repeat sequences. After purifica-</p>

<p>tion, the mixture was resolved in hybridization buffer contain-</p>

<p>ing yeast tRNA for blocking binding of non-specific </p>

<p>nucleotides. After the chips were in hybridization buffer with </p>

<p>salmon sperm DNA for 1 h, the chips were hybridized with </p>

<p>the purification mixture. Then they were incubated for 72 h </p>

<p>in the 37 o C hybridization chamber (BioMicro Systems, Salt </p>

<p>Lake City, UT). After hybridization was complete, the array </p>

<p>chips were washed and dried and then the arrays were scan-</p>

<p>ned with a Genepix Ⓡ (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). </p>

<p>(56%). Regions with 44% frequency of losses were 14q32.33 </p>

<p>and 15q11.2. Other regions with 33∼39% frequency of DNA </p>

<p>loss included 7q22.1, 10q26.3, 16p12.3, 16p13.11, and </p>

<p>22q11.21 (Table 2). 
To attempt to correlate a diagnosis with a specific region, </p>

<p>we applied statistics for each potential loci. All aberrant chro-</p>

<p>mosomal locations (＞30%) detected in array CGH (Table 2) </p>

<p>were selected in t test analysis. Although all 48 regions were </p>

<p>calculated, only t test analysis of five regions is shown in </p>

<p>Table 3. Because a high association was detected in all re-</p>

<p>gions, examples which indicated higher p-value (＞50% fre-</p>

<p>quency) are shown in the Tables </p>

<p>2) Real-time PCR </p>

<p>Four genes with obvious genomic changes were analyzed </p>

<p>using real-time PCR in order to assess the level of genomic </p>

<p>imbalance identified by array CGH in this study. Of the more </p>

<p>than 30% frequency clones, those considered to have vascular </p>

<p>related aberrations in the chromosome were selected for re-</p>

<p>al-time PCR. We evaluated the change in fold difference in </p>

<p>samples from normal and AD patients. Fig. 1 shows the re-</p>

<p>gions of chromosomal aberration in the four genes. Gains </p>

<p>were seen in 5p15.33, 15q26.3, and 21q22.3, which contain </p>

<p>the SDHA, PCSK6, and COL6A2 genes (A, B, and C), while </p>

<p>a loss was observed at 22q11.21, which contains the DGCR14 </p>

<p>genes (D). The fold difference obtained from the real-time </p>

<p>PCR was in accordance with the array CGH results and the </p>

<p>p-values of all samples was ＜0.05. The gain regions (A∼C; </p>

<p>COL6A2, PCSK6, and SDHA) in the results from the re-</p>

<p>al-time PCR were equal to all of the gain regions in the ar-</p>

<p>ray CGH. The relative fold decreases in DGCR14 (D) were </p>

<p>reflected similarly. </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>Aortic dissection is a life-threatening disease that develops </p>

<p>without warning. Despite significant advances in diagnostic </p>

<p>and therapeutic techniques, the overall in-hospital mortality </p>

<p>was 27.4% according to the international registry of aortic </p>

<p>dissection [19]. It occurs in 2∼9% of the population over 65 </p>

<p>years old, and the prevalence may be increasing [20]. Modern </p>

<p>diagnostic methods, such as computed or magnetic resonance </p>

<p>tomography, are able to show an aortic wall hematoma at the </p>

<p>acute onset of the disease. This hematoma will develop into </p>

<p>an aortic wall dissection over time [6]. Early recognition and </p>

<p>management are crucial, and it is therefore important to be </p>

<p>able to rapidly identify aortic dissection, initiate supportive </p>

<p>therapy, and refer patients to appropriate specialty care [2]. </p>

<p>Fig. 1. Relative fold differences selected from 4 genes in which the most frequent gains and losses detected were in the 5p, 15q, 21q, 
and 22q regions. Each sample is depicted (x axis), and the fold difference of the N-value was delineated in real-time PCR (y axis). A 
threshold level of 2 indicates significant DNA gain (A∼C), and 0.5 indicates significant DNA loss (D). At the chromosomal 21q22.3 loca-
tion, COL6A2 (A), the fold change of the sample was 2.25-to 3.14-fold (seven samples) versus 1-fold for the reference sample. The fold 
difference for the SDHA (B) was 2.4-to 4.57-fold (six samples). For the PCSK6 (C), in the chromosomal 15q26.3 region, the fold change 
of the sample was 2.11-to 4.76-fold (six samples) with a gain at the location. Finally, DGCR14 (D) had a 0.08∼0.4-fold change (seven 
samples) with a loss at the location (p＜0.05). </p>

<p>Current research is aimed at determining the phenotypic </p>

<p>consequences of specific copy number abnormalities in pa-</p>

<p>tients with ADs [21]. Cytogenetic analyses have revealed that </p>

<p>numerous somatic genetic changes in the pathogenesis of hu-</p>

<p>man diseases are involved in region-specific gains or losses </p>

<p>of DNA copy number; however, such changes have not yet </p>

<p>been reported in most ADs. Including classical cytogenetics, </p>

<p>fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Southern blot analy-</p>

<p>sis, quantitative PCR based assays, and CGH have been used </p>

<p>to detect copy number changes in human diseases, but these </p>

<p>techniques have several limitations [22]. Therefore, we at-</p>

<p>tempted to use array CGH. Unlike chromosomal CGH, array </p>

<p>CGH highly improves resolution and provides quantitative in-</p>

<p>formation of the level of chromosomal gain or loss [16,23]. </p>

<p>BAC array CGH has been used in several diseases but has </p>

<p>not been applied to ADs. 
In this report, the DNA copy number alterations frequently </p>

<p>identified in 18 patients with AD were analyzed using array </p>

<p>based CGH. Many regions throughout the entire genome were </p>

<p>altered. The DNA copy number alterations observed in the </p>

<p>Genomic Aberrations in Aortic Dissections </p>

<p>− 129 − </p>

<p>ADs were not random; they involved particular regions of the </p>

<p>genome and most usually involved parts of or the entire </p>

<p>DNA. DNA gains were found in regions 1p, 1q, 2p, 2q, 3q, </p>

<p>4q, 5p, 6p 7p, 7q, 8p, 8q, 10p, 10q, 11q, 12p, 12q, 13q, 14q, </p>

<p>15q, 17q, 19p, and 21q, and losses were found in 4q, 7q, </p>

<p>10q, 14q, 15q, 16p, and 22q (Table 2). DNA gains were </p>

<p>more frequently observed than DNA losses. 
Real-time PCR can be used to validate and quantify the </p>

<p>genomic changes identified by BAC array CGH [17]. Of the </p>

<p>more than 30% frequency clones in array CGH results, those </p>

<p>considered to have vascular related aberrations in the chromo-</p>

<p>some were selected for real-time PCR. Frequently, gains of </p>

<p>chromosomal DNA at COL6A2 were detected by CGH in pa-</p>

<p>tients with ADs. The collagen, type VI, alpha-2 (COL6A2) </p>

<p>gene encodes 1 of the 3 subunits that comprise the full colla-</p>

<p>gen VI protein. Collagen VI is expressed in developing hu-</p>

<p>man hearts [24]. The finding that collagen VI is a structural </p>

<p>protein supports that collagen VI is a candidate gene involved </p>

<p>in the development of congenital heart disease in Down </p>

<p>syndrome. The most frequent locus alteration was a gain at </p>

<p>the 15q26.3 region containing the PCSK6 gene. PCSK6 </p>

<p>(PACE4) is expressed at high levels in the anterior pituitary, </p>

<p>central nervous system, the developing olfactory bulb, heart, </p>

<p>and liver [25]. Moreover, SDHA is Complex II of the mi-</p>

<p>tochondrial respiratory chain, also known as succinate de-</p>

<p>hydrogenase or succinate ubiquinone oxidoreductase, and it </p>

<p>consists of four nuclear-encoded polypeptides. The specific </p>

<p>function of this gene has not yet been determined. Bourgeron </p>

<p>et al. identified a homozygous mutation in the SDHA gene in </p>

<p>two siblings with a mitochondrial complex II deficiency pre-</p>

<p>senting as Leigh's syndrome. Their study results demonstrated </p>

<p>that the flavoprotein subunit gene is duplicated in the human </p>

<p>genome and located on chromosome 5p15 [26]. Chromosome </p>

<p>arm 22q, which includes the COMT and DGCR14 genes, was </p>

<p>frequently under-represented. Chromosome 22q11.21 includes </p>

<p>the catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, and its dele-</p>

<p>tion syndrome is a common microdeletion syndrome asso-</p>

<p>ciated with a markedly elevated risk of several diseases [27]. </p>

<p>In addition to this region, DiGeorge syndrome critical region </p>

<p>gene 14 (DGCR14) has been associated with an elevated risk </p>

<p>of several diseases. A group of developmental disorders, in-</p>

<p>cluding DiGeorge syndrome (DGS), velocardiofacial syn-</p>

<p>drome (VCFS), conotruncal anomaly face syndrome, and </p>

<p>some familial or sporadic conotruncal cardiac defects have </p>

<p>been associated with microdeletion of 22q11.2 [28]. The four </p>

<p>altered regions (5p15.33, 15q26.3, 21q22.3 and 22q11.21) that </p>

<p>showed frequent genomic alteration were confirmed by re-</p>

<p>al-time PCR. 
In summary, array based CGH analysis of 18 patients with </p>

<p>AD showed that DNA copy number alterations are common </p>

<p>in AD. Real-time PCR confirmed that array CGH properly </p>

<p>detected gains in AD related genes. Aortic dissection is be-</p>

<p>lieved to develop through a chronic degeneration of the aortic </p>

<p>wall associated with aging, atherosclerosis, or hypertension. </p>

<p>But its etiology remains unresolved [20]. In this study, we </p>

<p>were able to delineate discrete regions of DNA copy number </p>

<p>alterations in several regions of the chromosomes that are </p>

<p>likely to harbor some relevant genes. </p>

<p>CONCLUSION </p>

<p>These data support the utility of array CGH for the identi-</p>

<p>fication of genomic alterations in AD. Although our results </p>

<p>suggest a new aspect of genomic alteration in patients with </p>

<p>ADs, our study was limited by a small sample number (n= </p>

<p>18) and the fact that it only included individuals of Korean </p>

<p>descent. Therefore, further studies should be carried out using </p>

<p>CGH techniques to validate our results. Information on chro-</p>

<p>mosomal variability can be generated by comparing the re-</p>

<p>sults of array CGH with information from the Human </p>

<p>Structural Variation Database and increasing patient numbers. 
This study is the first to use array CGH to search for can-</p>

<p>didate regions in Korean aortic dissection patients, these find-</p>

<p>ings might contribute to the understanding of important chro-</p>

<p>mosomal regions and the identification of candidate genes, </p>

<p>and may be used to investigate the pathogenesis of aortic </p>

<p>dissections. </p>

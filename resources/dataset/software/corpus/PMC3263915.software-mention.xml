<p>OBJECTIVEdTo test the safety and efficacy of exenatide once weekly (EQW) compared with 
metformin (MET), pioglitazone (PIO), and sitagliptin (SITA) over 26 weeks, in suboptimally 
treated (diet and exercise) drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdPatients were randomized to subcutaneous 
(SC) EQW 2.0 mg + oral placebo (n = 248), MET 2,000 mg/day + SC placebo (n = 246), PIO 45 
mg/day + SC placebo (n = 163), or SITA 100 mg/day + SC placebo (n = 163) for 26 weeks. 
MET and PIO therapies were increased to maximum-tolerated dosages. Injections with EQW 
or placebo were administered weekly, while oral medication or placebo was administered 
daily. </p>

<p>RESULTSdBaseline characteristics were as follows: 59% men, 67% Caucasian, mean age 54 
years, HbA 1c 8.5%, fasting serum glucose 9.9 mmol/L, body weight 87.0 kg, and diabetes du-
ration 2.7 years. HbA 1c reductions (%) at 26 weeks (least-squares means) with EQW versus MET, 
PIO, and SITA were 21.53 vs. 21.48 (P = 0.620), 21.63 (P = 0.328), and 21.15 (P , 0.001), 
respectively. Weight changes (kg) were 22.0 vs. 22.0 (P = 0.892), +1.5 (P , 0.001), and 20.8 
(P , 0.001), respectively. Common adverse events were as follows: EQW, nausea (11.3%) and 
diarrhea (10.9%); MET, diarrhea (12.6%) and headache (12.2%); PIO, nasopharyngitis (8.6%) 
and headache (8.0%); and SIT, nasopharyngitis (9.8%) and headache (9.2%). Minor (con-
firmed) hypoglycemia was rarely reported. No major hypoglycemia occurred. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONSdEQW was noninferior to MET but not PIO and superior to SITA with 
regard to HbA 1c reduction at 26 weeks. Of the agents studied, EQW and MET provided similar 
improvements in glycemic control along with the benefit of weight reduction and no increased 
risk of hypoglycemia. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND 
METHODS </p>

<p>Outcomes 
The aim of this study was to assess the 
efficacy of EQW compared with MET, PIO, 
and SITA, as measured by change in HbA 1c 
after 26 weeks. Secondary and exploratory 
measures included the proportion of pa-
tients achieving HbA 1c ,7.0 and #6.5%, 
changes in fasting serum glucose, seven-
point self-monitoring of blood glucose 
(SMBG), weight, serum lipids, homeostasis 
model assessment of pancreatic b-cell 
function (HOMA-B) and insulin sensitivity 
(HOMA-S), and safety and tolerability. 
Patient-reported outcomes were collected, 
including Impact of Weight on Quality of 
Life Questionnaire-Lite (IWQOL-Lite), 
Binge Eating Scale (BES), the Diabetes Treat-
ment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ), 
and EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D). 
Safety end points were adverse events, 
clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, 
hypoglycemia, and antibodies to exenatide. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events were 
defined as those occurring or worsening 
after the first dose of study drug. Minor 
hypoglycemia was defined as signs or 
symptoms associated with blood glucose 
,3.0 mmol/L (either self-treated or re-
solved independently). Major hypoglyce-
mia was classified as symptoms resulting 
in loss of consciousness or seizure that 
showed prompt recovery after administra-
tion of glucose, or documented blood glu-
cose ,3.0 mmol/L that required the 
assistance of another person because of 
severe impairment in consciousness or be-
havior. A subset, defined as symptoms of 
hypoglycemia, was not confirmed by 
blood glucose measurement. </p>

<p>Sample size determination 
The protocol specified that 822 patients 
be enrolled, with at least 740 patients 
(10% dropout before first HbA 1c collec-
tion) available for primary analysis. A 
sample of 740 patients (222 EQW and 
MET, 148 PIO and SITA) would provide 
;90% power to detect true differences in 
HbA 1c change of 0.4% (EQW vs. MET), 
0.5% (EQW vs. PIO), and 0.5% (EQW vs. 
SITA), respectively (two-sided t test sig-
nificance of 0.05 and common SD of 
1.2%) (6). A predefined noninferiority 
margin of 0.3% and sample size of 444 
patients would provide 74% power to 
test the noninferiority of EQW versus 
MET, and a sample size of 370 would pro-
vide 65% power to test the noninferiority 
of EQW versus PIO (and SITA). </p>

<p>Patients 
A total of 820 patients in 22 countries 
participated between November 2008 and 
June 2010. Adults with type 2 diabetes met 
the following inclusion criteria: HbA 1c 
7.1-11.0%, BMI 23-45 kg/m </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>, and history 
of stable weight. Patients were excluded if 
treated with any antihyperglycemic drug 
for .7 days within 3 months of screening. 
Antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medi-
cation changes were only made if medically 
required. </p>

<p>Study design 
Randomization was determined by 
computer-generated random sequence 
using an interactive voice response system. 
Treatment assignments were stratified by 
country. MET and PIO dosages were in-
creased in weekly increments up to target 
doses of 2,000 and 45 mg/day, respec-
tively. MET could be increased up to 
2,500 mg/day based on glycemic control. 
Standard diet and exercise counseling was 
provided in each treatment group. Fol-
lowing 26 weeks, patients stopped study 
treatment and were allowed to follow 
diabetes regimens deemed appropriate 
by the investigator, with the exception of 
exenatide BID. Patients returned to the 
study sites 10 weeks after study end for 
collection of additional safety data. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
Data were reported for randomized pa-
tients who received at least one dose of the 
study drug (intent-to-treat population). 
To control family-wise error within 0.05, 
the Bonferroni-Hommel gate-keeping 
procedure was used to test hypotheses. 
Three noninferiority hypotheses (EQW is 
inferior to MET, PIO, and SITA) were 
tested first using the Bonferroni test (non-
inferiority margin 0.3%, Bonferroni-
adjusted significance of 0.0167). If 
any null hypothesis was rejected (i.e., 
noninferiority was established), the corre-
sponding superiority hypothesis was tested 
using the Hommel test (8) and decision ma-
trix algorithm (9). The nominal significance 
level based on Hommel adjustment was be-
tween 0.0167 and 0.05 depending on the 
noninferiority hypotheses rejected. 
The primary end point was tested 
using a maximum likelihood-based 
mixed-model repeated-measures (MMRM) 
ANCOVA with change in HbA 1c as the de-
pendent variable; treatment, baseline 
HbA 1c , country, week of visit, and treat-
ment by week interaction as fixed effects; 
patient and error as random effects; and an 
unstructured variance/covariance matrix. </p>

<p>All scheduled postbaseline measurements 
were included, with no imputation of 
missing data. Least-squares (LS) estimates 
and CIs of the treatment differences be-
tween EQW and the three oral comparators 
were presented. The differences were based 
on the estimate at 26 weeks of EQW minus 
the estimate for each comparator at 26 
weeks. SEs were also presented. Secondary 
end points were tested using similar MMRM 
analyses. Analyses of patient-reported out-
comes were performed without adjustment 
for multiple statistical testing. 
The original primary analysis excluded 
unscheduled postbaseline observations 
for unexpected early discontinuations; 
therefore, a modified analysis was com-
pleted, including all postbaseline observa-
tions. This modified MMRM analysis was 
performed after database lock when it was 
determined that the original analysis ex-
cluded patients who discontinued before 
week 8. All statistical analyses were per-
formed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> Version <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">9.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS In- stitute, Cary, NC</rs>). </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>Patients 
Of 820 intent-to-treat patients, 696 
(84.9%) completed the 26-week treat-
ment period and 736 (89.8%) returned for 
10-week safety follow-up (Fig. 1). Patient 
characteristics at baseline were similar 
among the treatment groups (Supplemen-
tary Table 1). By week 12, 87% of patients 
taking MET and 75% taking PIO had been 
titrated to or above target doses for each 
agent (PIO 45 mg/day, MET 2,000 mg/day, 
respectively). At week 16-26, patients were 
on stable doses: PIO ($45 mg/day) 88% 
and MET ($2,000 mg/day) 76%. </p>

<p>Glycemic control and weight 
Mean baseline HbA 1c values ranged from 
8.4 to 8.6% across treatment groups. 
Figure 2A presents the time course of 
HbA 1c change from modified MMRM 
analysis (intent-to-treat sample; all post-
baseline observations included). This 
modified analysis demonstrated LS mean 
(SE) reductions in HbA 1c at 26 weeks of 
21.53% (0.07%) with EQW; 21.48% 
(0.07%) with MET (P = 0.620 vs. EQW; 
98.3% CI was 20.26 to 0.17); 21.63% 
(0.08%) with PIO (P = 0.328 vs. EQW; 
98.3% CI was 20.15 to 0.35); and 
21.15% (0.08%) with SITA (P , 0.001 
vs. EQW; 98.3% CI was 20.62 to 20.13). 
The LS mean (SE) HbA 1c at end point 
was 6.94 (0.07), 6.99 (0.07), 6.84 (0.08), 
and 7.32 (0.08) for EQW, MET, PIO, and </p>

<p>SITA, respectively. The original primary 
analysis, which excluded post-baseline ob-
servations from patients who discontinued 
before week 8, showed LS mean (SE) reduc-
tions in HbA 1c of 21.56% (0.07%) with 
EQW; 21.52% (0.06%) with MET (P = 
0.609 vs. EQW; 98.3% CI was 20.26 to 
0.17); 21.73% (0.08%) with PIO (P = 
0.107 vs. EQW; 98.3% CI was 20.08 to 
0.41); and 21.17% (0.08%) with SITA 
(P , 0.001 vs. EQW; 98.3% CI was 
20.63 to 20.16). Findings from original 
and modified primary analyses were consis-
tent and demonstrated that EQW was non-
inferior to MET and SITA, but did not reach 
the noninferiority measure with PIO. Sub-
sequent hypothesis testing concluded that 
EQW was superior to SITA, but not to MET. 
Similar percentages of EQW-, MET-, 
and PIO-treated patients reached a target 
HbA 1c ,7.0% (Fig. 2B). Significantly 
more patients treated with EQW versus 
SITA (P , 0.001) achieved HbA 1c 
,7.0% after 26 weeks. Moreover, signif-
icantly more patients treated with EQW 
achieved HbA 1c #6.5% after 26 weeks, 
versus MET-and SITA-treated patients 
(P = 0.004 and P , 0.001, respectively). 
LS mean baseline fasting serum glucose 
values ranged from 9.7 to 9.9 mmol/L 
across treatment groups. Reductions in </p>

<p>fasting serum glucose at 16 and 26 weeks 
were significantly greater in patients treated 
with EQW versus SITA (both P , 0.001). 
LS mean (SE) reductions in fasting serum 
glucose at 26 weeks were 22.3 mmol/L 
(0.1 mmol/L) in patients treated with 
EQW; 22.0 mmol/L (0.1 mmol/L) with 
MET (P = 0.155 vs. EQW); 22.6 mmol/L 
(0.2 mmol/L) with PIO (P = 0.153 vs. 
EQW); and 21.1 mmol/L (0.2 mmol/L) 
with SITA (P , 0.001 vs. EQW). 
Mean seven-point SMBG profiles 
showed similar reductions in blood glu-
cose from baseline to 26 weeks in EQW, 
MET, and PIO treatment groups (Supple-
mentary Figs. 1A-C). There were no sig-
nificant differences between EQW versus 
MET or PIO treatment groups with regard 
to changes from baseline for any of the 
seven time points or for daily mean 
SMBG; however, EQW was associated 
with greater mean reductions at all time 
points compared with SITA. Mean reduc-
tions in SMBG postmeal excursions after 
26 weeks were similar among all treat-
ment groups. 
LS mean baseline weight values 
ranged from 85.9 to 88.6 kg. Weight 
decreased with EQW, MET, and SITA 
treatment, but increased with PIO treat-
ment (Fig. 2C). Weight changes were </p>

<p>significantly different between EQW ver-
sus PIO and SITA starting at 4 and 8 weeks, 
respectively, and continued through 26 
weeks (all P # 0.003). At 26 weeks, LS 
mean (SE) body weight changes were 
22.0 kg (0.2 kg) with EQW; 22.0 kg (0.2 
kg) with MET (P = 0.892 vs. EQW); +1.5 kg 
(0.3 kg) with PIO (P , 0.001 vs. EQW); and 
20.8 kg (0.3 kg) with SITA (P , 0.001 vs. 
EQW). The percentage of patients with re-
ductions in both body weight and HbA 1c 
was similar for EQW and MET; percentages 
were comparably lower with PIO and SITA 
(Supplementary Figs. 2A-D). </p>

<p>Pancreatic b-cell function and 
insulin sensitivity 
b-Cell function, as measured by geomet-
ric mean HOMA-B (C-peptide), at base-
line ranged from 51.0 to 54.4%. Mean 
(SE) HOMA-B (ratio of end point [last ob-
servation carried forward] to baseline) 
was significantly (all P , 0.001) im-
proved in patients treated with EQW 
[+1.8 (0.06)] compared with MET [+1.4 
(0.04)], PIO [+1.3 (0.05)], and SITA [+1.3 
(0.04)]. Insulin sensitivity, as measured by

servation carried forward] to baseline) was </p>

<p>Safety and tolerability 
Serious adverse events were reported in 
1.6% (4/248), 5.3% (13/246), 5.5% (9/163), 
and 1.8% (3/163) of EQW-, MET-, PIO-, 
and SITA-treated patients, respectively, </p>

<p>during the treatment period. No serious 
adverse event was reported by more than 
one patient. One death, due to gastric ad-
enocarcinoma, was reported during the 
10-week follow-up in a patient receiving 
MET and was not considered by the in-
vestigator to be related to the study drug. 
One MET-treated patient experienced an 
adverse event of injection site nodule, con-
sidered serious for other medically sig-
nificant reasons (i.e., psychological). The 
event was of mild severity and resolved 
without treatment. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events re-
ported by $5% of patients in any group 
during the treatment period are shown in 
Table 1. All patients received injection, ei-
ther with active EQW or placebo micro-
sphere injection. Injection site nodules 
were more commonly reported with active 
EQW and placebo injection administered 
in the MET arm compared with placebo in-
jection administered in the PIO and SITA 
arms. Nausea, the most common treat-
ment-emergent adverse event with EQW, 
occurred in 11.3% of patients in this group. 
One EQW-treated patient withdrew be-
cause of nausea. Vomiting was reported in 
,5% of patients in all treatment groups, 
with incidences of 4.8% (12/248), 3.3% 
(8/246), 3.1% (5/163), and 1.8% (3/163) 
in EQW-, MET-, PIO-, and SITA-treated 
patients, respectively. Most treatment-
emergent adverse events had resolved by 
the end of the 10-week follow-up period 
(Supplementary Table 2). 
No patient had a major hypoglycemic 
episode during the treatment period of 
the study. The incidence of hypoglycemia 
unconfirmed by glucose measurement 
was low in all treatment groups: 5.2% 
(13/248), 4.1% (10/246), 3.7% (6/163), 
and 3.1% (5/163) of EQW-, MET-, PIO-, 
and SITA-treated patients, respectively. 
Minor (confirmed) hypoglycemia was lim-
ited to a small group of EQW-treated pa-
tients (5/248, 2.0%). 
No clinically significant changes in 
fasting serum lipids were observed during 
the treatment period. LS mean (SE) sys-
tolic blood pressure reductions of 21.3 
mmHg (0.8 mmHg), 21.7 mmHg (1.0 
mmHg), and 21.8 mmHg (1.0 mmHg) 
were observed with EQW, PIO, and 
SITA treatment, respectively. Additionally, 
a reduction in diastolic blood pressure of 
22.5 mmHg (0.6 mmHg) was observed 
with PIO treatment. Mean (SD) heart rate 
(bpm) increases were observed in the EQW 
[+1.5 (10.0)], MET [+0.3 (9.5)], and SITA 
[+0.5 (9.7)] groups; mean heart rate de-
creased in the PIO group [-1.7 (8.7)]. </p>

<p>No clinically significant changes in 
mean amylase, lipase, or calcitonin were 
observed during the treatment period. One 
SITA-treated patient with elevated lipase at 
screening experienced moderate chronic 
pancreatitis after 8 days of treatment and 
discontinued from study treatment. 
Lower-titer (,1/125) and higher-titer 
($1/625) antibodies to exenatide at end 
point were observed in 43.1% (107/248) 
and 11.3% (28/248) of EQW-treated 
patients, respectively. Mean HbA 1c was 
reduced irrespective of antibody status: 
negative (21.33%), positive lower 
(21.51%), and positive higher (21.02%) 
(Supplementary Table 3). Events with 
higher incidence in antibody-positive pa-
tients included injection site-related 
events (i.e., injection site erythema, injec-
tion site extravasation, injection site hema-
toma, injection site nodule, injection site 
pruritus, and injection site reaction). In-
jection site nodules are expected with mi-
crosphere injection and were not reported 
as an adverse event unless accompanied 
by symptoms such as pain, erythema, or 
pruritus. 
Patients in all treatment groups had 
mean improvements from baseline in 
perceived treatment satisfaction, weight-
related quality of life, and binge-eating 
behavior (Supplementary Tables 4-9). All 
treatments with the exception of PIO 
were associated with significant mean im-
provements in health status. Significant 
improvements in weight-related quality 
of life, binge-eating behavior, and health 
status were reported for patients treated 
with EQW compared with PIO. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONSdHead-to-head com-
parative studies are needed to better inform </p>

<p>treatment decisions for type 2 diabetes 
(1), a disease for which there are numerous 
treatment options. This study evaluated the 
efficacy and safety of EQW monotherapy, 
in comparison with MET, PIO, and SITA 
monotherapy, in drug-naive patients with 
type 2 diabetes. Treatment with EQW, 
MET, and PIO all resulted in improve-
ments in glycemic control, achieving 
mean HbA 1c concentrations at 26 weeks 
of ,7%. EQW demonstrated superiority 
to SITA and noninferiority to MET but 
not to PIO with regard to HbA 1c reduction 
at 26 weeks. The lack of noninferiority of 
EQW monotherapy compared with PIO 
monotherapy was unexpected based on 
DURATION-2 study results, where EQW 
was superior to PIO on a background of 
MET (10), and the fact that the HbA 1c re-
duction with PIO was greater than that re-
ported in other PIO studies with a similar 
baseline HbA 1c (2,3,11-14). Several dispa-
rate factors could have contributed to the 
incongruent outcomes, including differen-
ces in background therapy and mean dura-
tion of type 2 diabetes. 
SITA treatment led to comparatively 
lesser glycemic improvement than the other 
agents, which supports the contention that 
the increase in plasma glucagon-like peptide-
1 associated with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
inhibition is not as effective as pharmaco-
logical concentrations achieved with re-
ceptor agonism (15,16). The similar 
effects obtained with EQW monotherapy 
and MET monotherapy in terms of HbA 1c 
and body weight reductions support the 
appropriateness of considering MET as 
the first-line antihyperglycemic agent in 
type 2 diabetes. For example, the ADA/ 
EASD recommends MET as a first-line 
agent; other antihyperglycemic agents </p>

<p>are added in stepwise fashion with disease 
progression after MET failure (1). Find-
ings from DURATION-4 demonstrate 
that both EQW and PIO offer similar im-
provements in glycemia as MET, with one 
key difference between these agents being 
the effect on body weight. Thus, health 
care practitioners have more treatment 
choices for drug-naive patients. 
Clinicians are advised to consider mul-
tiple factors when treating patients with 
type 2 diabetes. Similar to previous studies 
evaluating PIO as monotherapy (3,13), 
patients treated with PIO in the current 
study gained weight. EQW and MET led 
to similar significant reductions in body 
weight after 26 weeks, whereas SITA led 
to a lesser reduction. Although variability 
based on study design and patient charac-
teristics was expected, weight reduction 
observed in this study with EQW was on 
the lower end of the range (22.0 to 23.7 
kg) observed in previous DURATION 
studies (6,7,10,17). Conversely, reduc-
tions observed with SITA and MET in 
the current study tended to be greater 
than results from meta-analyses and recent 
monotherapy trials of similar duration 
(5,18-20). The potential for improve-
ments in HbA 1c and body weight in stud-
ies with placebo injection therapy has 
been noted in a previous study of exenatide 
therapy (21). These data show that EQW 
and MET provided the best profile in 
terms of improving glycemic control as 
well as reducing weight, without increased 
risk of hypoglycemia, particularly impor-
tant for treatment of overweight or obese 
patients with type 2 diabetes. 
The findings with respect to safety 
and tolerability were consistent with pre-
vious studies, including the observance of 
gastrointestinal adverse events in patients 
treated with EQW and MET, and hyper-
tension and peripheral edema with PIO 
(3,5,6,10,17,20,22-24). Most notably, 
the safety profile of EQW in the current 
trial was consistent with previous DURA-
TION studies (6,10,17), with low rates of 
confirmed minor hypoglycemia and few 
patients discontinuing treatment due to 
nausea (one patient) and vomiting (zero 
patients). Less nausea and vomiting with 
EQW have previously been reported in 
head-to-head studies versus exenatide 
BID. In general, hypoglycemia incidence 
and incidence of serious adverse events 
were low across all treatment groups dur-
ing the current study. The small percent-
age (2%) of patients experiencing minor 
hypoglycemia with EQW monotherapy 
was similar to that observed with EQW </p>

<p>adjunct to MET in previous clinical trials 
(0-3%) (6,7,10,17). Most treatment-
emergent adverse events in this study 
had resolved by the end of the 10-week 
safety follow-up period, with few treatment-
emergent adverse events starting during 
the safety follow-up. 
There were several limitations to this 
study. First, patients were enrolled based 
on specific criteria and were followed 
according to the study schedule, which 
may not reflect real-world use. Second, no 
specific compliance data were collected; 
however, patient-reported outcomes in-
dicated that both oral and injectable 
therapies were associated with increases 
in treatment satisfaction and quality of life 
in these previously drug-naive patients. 
Additionally, 26 weeks is too short a 
study duration to evaluate long-term gly-
cemic control, weight loss, and b-cell 
preservation (25). For example, potential 
implications of the upward shift in HbA 1c , 
observed in the EQW group between 
weeks 16 and 26 (Fig. 2A), cannot be as-
sessed further without additional data 
points. 
In conclusion, in these patients with 
type 2 diabetes who were naive to anti-
hyperglycemic therapy, all four treatments 
resulted in improvements in HbA 1c , and a 
majority of EQW-, MET-, and PIO-treated 
patients achieved a target HbA 1c of 
,7.0%. This study recognizes that guide-
lines typically recommend MET as the first 
agent used, because it is inexpensive and 
supported by long-term data. Of the 
agents studied, EQW and MET provided 
similar improvements in glycemic control 
along with the benefit of weight reduction 
and no increased risk of hypoglycemia. 
There were no unexpected findings with 
regard to safety or tolerability. Based on 
these 26-week data, EQW is a once-
weekly dosing option for initial therapy. 
Longer-term studies will be required to 
assess the durability of the observations 
in this study. </p>

<p>Tissue repair is an essential homeostatic response that entails 
the orchestration of a wealth of cellular and molecular events 
involving resident and inflammatory cell types (Martin, 1997). 
Similarities have been noted between healing wounds and 
tumors (Dvorak, 1986), and key genes expressed during wound 
healing and in cancer share transcriptional regulatory mecha-
nisms (Dauer et al., 2005). Moreover, wounding hastens skin 
carcinogenesis in transgenic mouse models (DePianto et al., 
2010; Kasper et al., 2011; Wong and Reiter, 2011). Defining the 
mechanisms regulating the amplitude and duration of normal 
tissue repair events may shed light on what goes awry in tumors, 
in chronic nonhealing wounds, and related disease settings 
(Djalilian et al., 2006). 
The type II keratins 6a and 6b (K6a and K6b) and their 
partner type I keratins 16 and 17 (K16 and K17) are rapidly 
induced in wound-proximal epidermal keratinocytes after skin 
injury and in chronic disease settings (e.g., psoriasis and can-
cer) in addition to being normally expressed in epithelial 
appendages (Mansbridge and Knapp, 1987; Paladini et al., 
1996; McGowan and Coulombe, 1998; Takahashi et al., 1998). </p>

<p>Mice null for K6a/K6b die within a week after birth, correlating 
with severe oral blistering secondary to fragility in the filiform 
papillae, an epithelial appendage of the dorsal tongue epithe-
lium (Wong et al., 2000). Skin grafting showed that K6 
/ keratino-
cytes, which also exhibit reduced K16 levels owing to enhanced 
turnover (Bernot et al., 2005), are mechanically compromised 
and readily rupture while attempting to migrate into the setting 
of acute skin wounds in situ (Wong and Coulombe, 2003). In 
skin explant culture, a setting in which frictional forces are 
lesser but otherwise very relevant to wound epithelialization 
in situ (Mazzalupo et al., 2002), K6 
/ keratinocytes maintain 
their integrity and actually migrate markedly faster than wild 
type (WT; Wong and Coulombe, 2003). Of note, changes in the 
expression and/or regulation of intermediate filament (IF) pro-
teins is a common occurrence after injury to various tissues 
including muscle and central nervous system, and, otherwise, 
IF proteins have been shown to impact the migration of several 
types of cells (Coulombe and Wong, 2004). 
Select phosphotyrosine epitopes that positively react with 
the widely used mouse monoclonal antibody 4G10 are enriched 
in cell lysates prepared from cultured K6 
/ skin explants </p>

<p>I </p>

<p>njury to the epidermis triggers an elaborate homeo-
static response resulting in tissue repair and recovery 
of the vital barrier function. The type II keratins 6a and 
6b (K6a and K6b) are among the genes induced early on 
in wound-proximal keratinocytes and maintained during 
reepithelialization. Paradoxically, genetic ablation of 
K6a and K6b results in enhanced keratinocyte migration. 
In this paper, we show that this trait results from activa-
tion of Src kinase and key Src substrates that promote cell 
migration. Endogenous Src physically associated with 
keratin proteins in keratinocytes in a K6-dependent fashion. </p>

<p>Purified Src bound K6-containing filaments via its SH2 
domain in a novel phosphorylation-independent manner, 
resulting in kinase inhibition. K6 protein was enriched in 
the detergent-resistant membrane (DRM), a key site of Src 
inhibition, and DRMs from K6-null keratinocytes were de-
pleted of both keratin and Src. We conclude that K6 neg-
atively regulates Src kinase activity and the migratory 
potential of skin keratinocytes during wound repair. Our 
findings may also be important in related contexts such 
as cancer. </p>

<p>of keratin filaments prompted us to assess the role of Src kinase 
in migrating K6 
/ keratinocytes. 
Src family kinase (SFK) hyperactivation in K6 
/ lysates 
was confirmed through reactivity with an antibody directed at 
phospho-Tyr416, which marks an activated state (Fig. 1 B; see 
Fig. S1 E for quantitation). In contrast, SFK activity level was 
normal in lysates prepared from K14 
/ or K17 
/ keratino-
cytes (Figs. 1 B and S1 E), which show WT-like migration (not 
depicted). Key Src substrates with defined roles in cell migra-
tion (e.g., FAK, P130Cas, and paxillin) showed enhanced tyro-
sine phosphorylation on Src-regulated sites in K6 
/ but not in 
K14 
/ or K17 
/ keratinocytes (Fig. 1 B). By immunostaining, 
activated Src/SFK epitopes concentrate at the leading edge of 
K6 
/ keratinocytes compared with WT (Fig. 1 C; quantified in 
Fig. S1 F), a pattern known to favor epithelial cell migration 
during corneal wound closure (Gao et al., 2004). Migration of 
WT and K6 
/ keratinocytes was markedly inhibited by treat-
ment of skin explants with the Src inhibitor PP2 (Hanke et al., 
1996), suggesting a requirement for Src activity in this setting 
(Fig. S1 G). Western blot analysis of protein extracts from 
wound edge tissue in WT mouse skin showed that Src activa-
tion, as well as FAK and Crk-associated substrate (CAS) phos-
phorylation, is robustly enhanced relative to intact skin tissue 
away from the wound (Fig. S2 A). K6 and K17 are induced at 
the total protein level, whereas K5 levels remained fairly con-
stant, in this setting (Fig. S2, A and B; Paladini et al., 1996; </p>

<p>(Wong and Coulombe, 2003), including a protein of 60-kD M r , 
the correct size for Src, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase with an 
established role in cell migration (Altun-Gultekin and Wagner, 
1996; Hall et al., 1996). Src is activated in wound settings as 
well as in psoriatic and neoplastic skin (Ayli et al., 2008). Here, 
we explore the novel hypothesis that K6 normally functions to 
dampen Src signaling in wound-activated keratinocytes and 
that the loss of K6 leads to unimpeded Src activation and 
enhanced keratinocyte migration. </p>

<p>Results and discussion </p>

<p>Building on previous findings involving a skin explant culture 
assay (Wong and Coulombe, 2003), we find that K6 
/ skin ke-
ratinocytes in primary culture show enhanced migration after 
scratch wounding (Fig. 1 A) and in transwell migration assays 
(Fig. S1 A). Therefore, this phenotype is very robust and repre-
sents an intrinsic property of K6 
/ keratinocytes. The intra-
cellular organization of keratin filaments appears normal in 
the absence of K6 (Fig. S1 B). The 4G10 antibody used in our pre-
vious study (Wong and Coulombe, 2003) reacts with in vitro 
activated Src and immunoprecipitates Src and FAK from 
mouse skin keratinocytes (in a complex and/or individually; 
see Fig. S1, C and D). Collectively, the cell-autonomous en-
hancement in migration potential, the increased tyrosine phos-
phorylation of a 60-kD protein, and the largely intact organization </p>

Keratins regulate Src activity • Rotty and Coulombe </p>

<p>Thus, loss of K6 may also lead to a change in focal adhesion 
character that helps stimulate keratinocyte migration. Support 
for this notion comes from a large body of literature implicating 
Src-related focal adhesion turnover as a potent stimulator of cell 
migration (Fincham and Frame, 1998; Frame et al., 2002). 
Next, we assessed whether Src physically associates with 
keratins, as this would provide a potential causal link between 
the loss of K6 and increased Src activity. Keratin proteins in-
deed coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous Src from skin 
keratinocytes in primary culture (Fig. 2 A). This interaction was 
dependent on K6, as conveyed by parallel coimmunoprecipita-
tion assays from K6 
/ keratinocytes (Fig. 2 A). In vitro, purified 
His-tagged human Src protein (full-length [FL] Src protein) effi-
ciently cosedimented with assembled K6/K17 filaments recon-
stituted from pure human recombinant proteins (Fig. 2, B and C). 
Such cosedimentation reflects genuine keratin binding, as the 
C-terminal catalytic domain (CD) of Src (Src CD; Fig. 3 A) pel-
lets poorly in this assay (Fig. 2, B and C). In vitro activated Src 
also readily cosedimented with K6/K17 filaments (Fig. 2 B). Far-
Western assays revealed that purified Src preferentially binds 
type II keratins (K5 and K6) and the type III IF vimentin, rela-
tive to type I keratins (Fig. 2 D). This trend is enhanced when 
using preactivated Src as the ligand, as binding to K6 and vimen-
tin remains strong compared with K5 or type I keratins (Fig. 2 D). </p>

<p>McGowan and Coulombe, 1998; Takahashi et al., 1998). By 
immunostaining, activated Src occurs in K6-expressing epi-
dermal keratinocytes, both in cells actively migrating into the 
wound bed (Fig. S2 B) or located behind the migrating front 
(not depicted), in wounded WT mouse skin. Activated Src 
shows a distinct staining pattern in many infiltrating, actively 
migrating keratinocytes that conveys its membrane proximity 
(Fig. S2 C, arrows). Together, our ex vivo and in vivo findings 
on SFKs and key Src substrates with a defined role in cell motil-
ity strongly suggest that the migratory phenotype occurring in 
K6 
/ keratinocytes involves an increase in Src activity. 
Immunostaining also shows that activated Src is concen-
trated at focal adhesions in keratinocyte cultures from both geno-
types, as inferred from comparing its localization with that of 
vinculin at the outer edge of cells (Fig. S3, arrows). Likewise, 
phosphorylated CAS, FAK, and paxillin all localized to vinculin-
containing structures (Figs. 1 D and Fig. S3 [arrows]) in WT 
and K6 
/ cells. Further, all of these markers were markedly re-
distributed in many K6 
/ keratinocytes, generating a striking 
pattern of closely aligned dots delineating the outer cell mem-
brane (bordering; Figs. 1 D and Fig. S3 [arrowheads]). This 
contrasts with WT cells, in which activated Src staining formed 
a corrugated cellular outline, and its substrates were concen-
trated in physically well-separated protrusions (Figs. 1 D and S3). </p>

et al., 1988), and this could account for its greater affinity for 
type II keratins. 
Src autophosphorylation is significantly hindered when 
it is equilibrated with K6/K17 filaments before activation 
(Fig. 3 D; quantitation is shown in Fig. 3 E). In contrast, auto-
phosphorylation and activation of Src's CD were minimally 
altered by the presence of K6/K17 filaments (Fig. 3, D and E), 
conveying that the degree of kinase inhibition achieved is 
proportional to the affinity of Src for keratin IFs (Fig. 2, B 
and C). These in vitro findings suggest that the binding of 
Src to K6 might negatively regulate its kinase activity in WT 
keratinocytes in vivo. 
Cell migration is a highly spatially organized process 
(Martin, 1997), raising the prospect that the keratin-Src inter-
action may be segregated to a specialized subcellular compart-
ment at or near the membrane. We focused on detergent-resistant 
membranes (DRMs) as a location of interest as a result of its 
established role as a key site of Src regulation (Oneyama et al., 
2008). Upon activation, Src is recruited to cholesterol-rich mem-
brane microdomains (which are resistant to Triton X-100 extrac-
tion), where it phosphorylates C-terminal Src kinase (CSK)-binding 
protein (CBP; Kawabuchi et al., 2000). CSK is then recruited 
and inactivates Src via phosphorylation of its C-terminal tail 
(Oneyama et al., 2008). Keratin (Caruso and Stemmer, 2011) 
and vimentin (Berg et al., 2009) IF proteins have been found in 
DRMs. Likewise, we identified a fraction of the keratin pool, 
including K5, K6 (Fig. 4, A and B), K14, and K17 (not depicted) 
as well as Src itself (Fig. 4 C), in DRM fractions from WT skin 
explant lysates. In contrast, lysates from K6 
/ keratinocytes 
showed reduced levels of keratin and Src in DRMs (Fig. 4, A-C). 
Two phosphorylated forms of Src also localized to DRM fractions 
in both WT and K6 
/ explant lysate (Fig. 4 D). Consistent with </p>

<p>Confocal microscopy was used to relate the distribution of en-
dogenous Src and transfected GFP-tagged keratin in nonmigrat-
ing WT keratinocytes in conventional primary culture. Both 
proteins showed a broad, pan-cytoplasmic distribution and 
partially colocalized (Fig. 2 E). Coimmunoprecipitation of Src 
and keratin from WT skin wounds in situ proved difficult as a 
result of the relatively small amount of activated K6/K17-
expressing keratinocytes compared with other cell types (e.g., 
inflammatory cells and dermal fibroblasts), cellular debris, 
and the protein-rich scab. As an alternative, we used TPA 
(12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) treatment of mouse ear 
to induce both K6 expression and Src activation in epidermis 
(Fig. 2 F; Xian et al., 1997). Keratins coimmunoprecipitated 
with Src in this context (Fig. 2 G). These data establish that Src 
directly binds keratins and that K6, in particular, shows a consis-
tently higher affinity for Src kinase whether it is active or not. 
Next, we set out to map the determinants mediating Src 
binding to keratins. Src comprises three major domains: SH3, 
SH2, and the CD (Fig. 3 A; Xu et al., 1997). Src's CD interacts 
poorly with keratin filaments (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, a 
His-GFP-Src N-terminal fusion comprising the SH3 and SH2 
domains (Fig. 3 A) showed full binding to keratin IFs in cosedi-
mentation assays (Fig. 3 B). Upon further dissection, the SH2 
domain (residues 149-254) mediated strong binding to keratin 
IFs in copelleting assays (Fig. 3 B) and exhibited a higher 
affinity for type II keratins in Far-Western blots (Fig. 3 C). The 
SH3 domain did not bind keratin in either assay (Fig. 3, B and C). 
Direct binding to Src's SH2 domain does not involve phos-
phorylated tyrosine residues on keratins, given their recombi-
nant bacterial source, implying that it is mediated by a novel 
binding determinant. A motif homologous to type I keratins 
has been recognized in this specific region of Src (Tachibana </p>

Keratins regulate Src activity • Rotty and Coulombe </p>

<p>et al., 2006; Todorović et al., 2010). Plakoglobin, in particular, 
is a known Src target (Miravet et al., 2003) and reacts with the 
monoclonal antibody 4G10 (unpublished data). The molecu-
lar mass of plakoglobin (80 kD) corresponds to a tyrosine-
phosphorylated epitope that is elevated in lysates from migrating 
K6 
/ keratinocytes (Wong and Coulombe, 2003). Others have 
recently shown that plakoglobin and other desmosomal proteins 
are enriched in DRM fractions (Delva et al., 2008; Brennan 
et al., 2011), as we observed in WT and K6 
/ mouse keratino-
cytes (unpublished data). These findings raise the distinct pos-
sibility of plakoglobin's contribution, perhaps in conjunction 
with other keratin-binding proteins (e.g., plectin) to the recruit-
ment of keratin proteins to lipid rafts and/or to regulation of Src 
in migrating keratinocytes. 
Cells likely possess mechanisms guarding them against 
the negative consequences of excessive Src activity, which, in 
settings such as tissue repair, is promoted by numerous growth 
factors, activated integrins, and other stimuli (Martin, 1997). 
High Src activity is a powerful inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal 
transitions (Behrens et al., 1993) and also is a recurring charac-
teristic of human cancers (Bild et al., 2006). K6 is also com-
monly induced in carcinomas affecting skin and related complex 
epithelia (Moll et al., 1983); intriguingly, loss of K6 expression 
correlates with a more aggressive behavior in endometrial 
cancers (Stefansson et al., 2006) and squamous cell carci-
noma of the skin (Larcher et al., 1992). Although the role of 
K6 in tumor settings has not been defined, we speculate that </p>

<p>our model, there was no difference in the amount of pY527 
(inhibited) SFK epitopes in DRM fractions from WT and K6 </p>

<p>/ </p>

<p>keratinocytes, whereas there was a clear reduction in p-Y416 
(activated) epitopes in K6 
/ relative to WT (Fig. 4 D). In con-
trast, FAK, phospho-FAK, phospho-CAS, and phospho-paxillin 
do not occur in DRM fractions in either genotype (unpublished 
data). Such findings argue that the localization of Src to DRMs 
may be distinct from its recruitment to focal adhesions. 
In conclusion, our data suggest that in addition to its pre-
viously defined structural support role in wound-proximal kera-
tinocytes (Wong and Coulombe, 2003), K6 (and potentially its 
partner K16) participates in the regulation and optimization of 
epithelial migration by dynamically binding to Src. The canoni-
cal view of Src regulation involves an on/off switch, with inacti-
vation taking place within DRMs (Fig. 4 E; Cooper et al., 1986; 
Oneyama et al., 2008; Guarino, 2010). Based on the findings 
reported here, we propose that a direct interaction between Src 
and K6 and perhaps other proteins results in a prolonged se-
questration of Src in DRMs of wound-activated WT skin keratino-
cytes, thus delaying its reactivation and dampening its overall 
activity at the leading edge (Fig. 4 E). 
Mouse keratinocytes null for the keratin-binding proteins 
epiplakin, plakophilin, or plectin (South et al., 2003; Goto et al., 
2006; Osmanagic-Myers et al., 2006) or the keratin-associated 
plakoglobin (Yin et al., 2005) all exhibit enhanced migration 
phenotypes. Furthermore, ablation of plectin or plakoglobin 
robustly activates SFKs (Goto et al., 2006; Osmanagic-Myers </p>

of the mechanism of Src regulation in wound-
activated keratinocytes without (left) and with

Src is regulated by an on/off switch, with ac-
tivation (asterisks) by exposure to growth fac-
tors (GF) and/or activated integrins followed 
by translocation to DRMs and inhibition via 
interaction with CSK and CBP. Src reactivation 
requires translocation out of DRMs (Guarino, 
2010). We propose that a keratin-binding 
step within DRMs delays Src exit from rafts, 
thereby moderating the pool of Src available 
for reactivation by relevant stimuli. Note that 
the sequence with which Src interacts with 
CBP, CSK, and K6 (and other entities in DRMs) 
is unknown. </p>

into mKER media, and live cells were purified in Lymphoprep solution 
(AXIS-SHIELD) and cultured in mKER media. 308 cells (a mouse keratino-
cyte cell line; Strickland et al., 1988) were cultured in mKER media (Rouabhia 
et al., 1992; Bernot et al., 2004). WT and K6 
/ keratinocytes were har-
vested from newborn mice and seeded on glass coverslips in six-well plates 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) for primary culture in mKER media (Wong and 
Coulombe, 2003). Subconfluent cultures were transfected 24 h after plat-
ing using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's pro-

of K16 (Takahashi et al., 1994; Bernot et al., 2002), K6 (McGowan and 
Coulombe, 1998), and K17 (McGowan and Coulombe, 1998) have been 
previously described. </p>

<p>Microscopy 
All samples were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS before immunostaining. Stained 
coverslips or slides were mounted in Tris-buffered Fluoro-Gel (Electron 
Microscopy Sciences). Src and GFP-K17 colocalization was imaged by con-
focal microscopy (at room temperature with an Axiovert 200 microscope 
equipped with the 510 META module; Carl Zeiss). Images were taken using 
the 63× objective (1.4 NA Plan-Apochromat oil objective), and acquisi-
tion was performed via <rs id="software-2" type="software">LSM</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">510</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Carl Zeiss</rs>). Goat anti-rabbit 
secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen) was used 
to image Src staining, and goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conju-
gated to Alexa Fluor 488 was used to enhance GFP signal (Invitrogen). 
p-Y416 Src and K6 staining in WT mouse wounds were imaged by confo-
cal microscopy (Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with the 510 META 
module at room temperature). Images were taken using the 20× (0.75 NA 
Plan-Apochromat air) and 40× (1.3 NA Plan-NEOFLUAR oil) objectives, 
and acquisition was performed via <rs id="software-3" type="software">LSM</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">510</rs> software. Goat anti-rabbit 
secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 was used in each 
case. Cell stains used to assess Src and focal adhesion protein localization 
were performed from WT and K6 
/ keratinocytes in primary culture 
seeded on fibronectin (EMD)-coated coverslips (final concentration of 
10 µg/ml and diluted in 1× PBS). p-Y416 Src/SFK, vinculin, p-Y925 FAK, 
p-Y410 CAS, and p-Y118 paxillin immunostainings were imaged on a fluor-
escent microscope (Axio Observer.Z1; Carl Zeiss) at room temperature. 
Images were taken using the 63× objective (1.4 NA Plan-Apochromat oil 
objective) and acquired via <rs type="software">AxioVision</rs> software with a camera (AxioCam 
MRm) and saved as raw data files (Carl Zeiss). Secondary antibodies con-
jugated to Alexa Fluor 594 or 488 (Invitrogen) were used to image. Analy-
sis of all images was performed using the <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> freeware. </p>

<p>Immunoprecipitation 
Confluent WT and K6 
/ primary keratinocyte cultures were scraped into 
lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 
and 1× protease cocktails), incubated for 15 min at 4°C, and spun down 
for 10 min at 4°C. Lysates were precleared with Rabbit TrueBlot agarose 
beads (eBioscience), and coimmunoprecipitation was performed overnight 
at 4°C with Src antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) or a suitable nega-
tive control (K17 preimmune serum or normal rabbit IgG). Rabbit TrueBlot </p>

<p>Materials and methods </p>

<p>Mouse lines 
All experiments involving mice were reviewed and approved by the Institu-
tional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mouse lines were maintained under 
specific pathogen-free conditions and fed chow and water ad libitum. K6 
(Wong et al., 2000) and K17 hemizygous-null mice (McGowan et al., 2002) 
were maintained in the inbred C57BL/6 background. K14 hemizygous-null 
mice (Lloyd et al., 1995) were maintained in a mixed strain background. 
Genotyping was performed as previously described (Wong and Coulombe, 
2003; Tong and Coulombe, 2006; Kerns et al., 2007). </p>

<p>In vivo wounding and tissue preparation 
Full-thickness wounds were made using a 4-mm punch biopsy device in WT 
C57BL/6 mice. Wounds were harvested 3 d later and either embedded in 
optimal cutting temperature compound (Tissue-Tek; Sakura) and frozen 
on dry ice or diced and homogenized in 0.5% Triton X-100-containing 
lysis buffer for Western blot analysis. 5-µm sections of fresh frozen mouse 
skin wounds were produced on a cryostat (Microm HM550; Thermo 
Fisher Scientific). </p>

<p>Explant outgrowth 
Culture of newborn mouse skin explants was performed as previously de-
scribed (Mazzalupo et al., 2002; Wong and Coulombe, 2003; Bernot 
et al., 2004). In brief, 4-mm punch biopsies were cultured in mouse kera-
tinocyte (mKER) medium for 8 d. The tissue moiety (original punch) was 
removed, cellular outgrowths were collected into lysis buffer (Wong and 
Coulombe, 2003), and cytosolic and membrane fractions were prepared 
as previously described (Osmanagic-Myers and Wiche, 2004). Cells 
were incubated in the presence of 0.01% digitonin and spun down, and 
pellets were resuspended in 0.5% Triton X-100-containing lysis buffer. 
Quantitative outgrowth assays were performed under the same condi-
tions using 2-mm punch biopsies, except that on day 3, explants were 
treated with mitomycin C (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h to irreversibly inhibit 
DNA replication and mitosis (Wong and Coulombe, 2003; Bernot et al., 
2004) and then with (or without) PP2 (Life Technologies) at various con-
centrations. PP2 treatments continued from day 3 to day 6, at which point 
both punch and outgrowth were fixed and stained with Giemsa dye 
(Sigma-Aldrich). Stained outgrowths were scanned, and the outgrowth 
area was measured using the <rs id="software-4" type="software">ImageJ</rs> freeware (<rs corresp="#software-4" type="creator">National Institutes of Health</rs>), as previously described (Wong and Coulombe, 2003; Bernot 
et al., 2004), by subtracting the area of the punch (square pixels) from 
the total area of punch and outgrowth (square pixels). Student's t test was 
applied to determine probability values. </p>

<p>Scratch wounding 
Newborn mouse skin keratinocytes were seeded for primary culture in two-
or four-well chamber slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and allowed to reach 
confluency as a monolayer (24 h after plating). Cells were then serum 
starved overnight. At 48 h of culture, monolayers were scratched with a 
P200 pipette tip, and the mKER medium was replaced. Keratinocytes were 
allowed to migrate for 24 h and then fixed in 4% PFA for analysis. Both 
WT and K6 
/ primary keratinocytes were imaged via K17 immunostain-
ing (Mazzalupo et al., 2002; Wong and Coulombe, 2003; Bernot et al., 
2004). Area and distance of outgrowth were quantified using the freeware 
<rs type="software">ImageJ</rs>. Area of outgrowth was computed as the area of initial wound minus 
the area of wound remaining at 24 h, whereas distance of outgrowth is the 
straight-line distance from the wound edge to the leading cell periphery 
along the line and was measured multiple times for every wound sample to 
correct for potential local differences in keratinocyte migration. Outgrowth 
was then expressed relative to WT values, and Student's t test analysis was 
used to calculate probability values. </p>

<p>Transwell assays 
WT and K6-null keratinocytes were seeded onto chambers (Transwell; 
Corning) coated with rat tail collagen (BD) and allowed to migrate over-
night. Cells that migrated through the chamber were fixed in methanol for 
5 min. Membranes were then allowed to dry before being stained with 
Giemsa solution (EMD) overnight at room temperature. Membrane was </p>

or p-Y416 SFK antibodies. </p>

<p>Isolation of DRM fractions 
DRMs were prepared according to a previously published protocol 
(Kawabuchi et al., 2000). Explanted WT or K6 
/ keratinocytes were 
lysed in TNE-T buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 
1% Triton X-100 plus sodium vanadate, protease inhibitors, and PMSF) 
and mixed with an equal volume of 85% sucrose in TNE (TNE-T minus Triton 
X-100). Samples were overlayed with 4 ml of 35% sucrose and 0.5 ml of 
5% sucrose and filled with TNE. Discontinuous sucrose gradients were 
spun overnight at 32,500 rpm, and 500-µl fractions were collected and 
analyzed for DRM positivity via dot blot using Cholera toxin B-HRP (Sigma-
Aldrich) to detect GM1 ganglioside. Fractions were then subjected to SDS-
PAGE and Western blotting according to standard protocols. </p>

<p>Generation of Src constructs 
The regions encoding the N terminus, SH3, and SH2 domains in the murine 
Src cDNA (available from GenBank under accession no. AAX90616.1; CD 
protein and construct provided by J. Kuriyan, University of California Berkeley, 
Berkeley, CA) were PCR amplified (see following primer sets) and subcloned 
into a previously described vector (Lee and Coulombe, 2009) derived from 
pEGFP-c3 (Takara Bio Inc.) and a His vector (Geisbrecht et al., 2006) 
for bacterial protein expression and purification. The oligonucleotide primer 
sets used for the PCR-based cloning of Src domains were as follows: 
N terminus (residues 1-254) forward 5-CCCAAGCTTATGGGCAGCAAC-
AAGAGCAAGCCCAAGGAC-3 and reverse 5-CGGGATCCTCAGGG-
ACATACGGTAGTGAGGC-3; SH3 (residues 1-148) forward 5-CCCA-
AGCTTATGGGCAGCAACAAGAGCAAGCCCAAGGAC-3 and reverse 
5-CGGGATCCTCAGGAGGGCGCCACATAGTTGC-3; and SH2 (residues 
149-254) forward 5-CCCAAGCTTGACTCCATCCAGGCTGAG-3 and 
reverse 5-CGGGATCCTCAGGGACATACGGTAGTGAGGC-3. </p>

<p>Data quantitation 
Src activity was quantified from Western blot signals using the <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> free-
ware to measure band intensity and normalize it to caveolin to adjust for 
loading. The final data for K6 
/ samples are reported relative to WT. Src 
activity was also quantified at the leading edge of keratinocytes in immuno-
stained preparations using <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs>. The leading edge of WT or K6 </p>

<p>/ </p>

<p>cells was traced in <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> and quantified for mean pixel intensity and sur-
face area. Values reported are a ratio of mean pixel intensity at the lead-
ing edge per area of leading edge. In cosedimentation assays in vitro 
involving reconstituted keratin filaments, the fraction of bound proteins (Src 
FL or Src CD) was quantified using <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs> in a similar manner, except that 
signal intensity of pelleted Src was divided by total Src signal intensity (total 
found in supernatant and pellet fractions). Similarly, Src's activity status in 
this in vitro setting was quantitated in the same fashion, except that an 
activity ratio was obtained by relating the intensity of the phospho-Src signal 
in presence and absence of keratin filaments. </p>

<p>Statistical analyses 
All error bars reported represent the SEM. Student's two-tailed t test was 
applied for all statistical analyses. Individual p-values are reported for each 
experiment and were considered significant when P ≤ 0.05. </p>

<p>beads were added the next morning for 1 h, and the beads were spun 
down and washed three times in lysis buffer. Immunoblotting was per-
formed using the secondary antibody Rabbit TrueBlot goat anti-rabbit HRP 
system (eBioscience). When mouse monoclonal antibodies were used, pro-
tein A Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) and goat anti-mouse HRP (Sigma-
Aldrich) were used in lieu of the specialized beads and the aforementioned 
secondary antibody (modified from Kim et al. [2007]). </p>

<p>TPA treatment 
WT mouse ears were treated with equal volumes (30 µl) of either 250 ng 
TPA/µl or acetone on days 1 and 3 of the protocol. Ears were harvested 
on day 5 of the protocol, diced, and homogenized into 0.5% Triton X-100 
or 1% NP-40-containing lysis buffer. Samples were collected for Western 
blot or immunoprecipitation using methods described in the previous section. </p>

<p>Protein purification 
Recombinant human keratin and vimentin proteins were purified from bac-
terial inclusion bodies, as previously described (Lee and Coulombe, 2009). 
In brief, proteins were induced in either BL21 DE3 or BL21 pLys cells over-
night at 32°C. Inclusion bodies were prepared and incubated in 6.5 M 
Urea-containing buffer overnight at 4°C. Crude inclusion body prepara-
tions were fractionated using anion-exchange fast protein liquid chroma-
tography and eluted with a linear gradient of guanidinium-HCl (0-500 mM) 
on a HiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare) to resolve monomeric keratins. 
Next, type I and type II keratins were mixed for 1 h at room temperature, 
and heterotypic keratin complexes (1:1 molar ratio) were purified using 
anion-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography and eluted with a lin-
ear gradient of guanidinium-HCl on a Mono Q column (GE Healthcare; 
Lee and Coulombe, 2009). His-GFP-Src fusion proteins were induced over-
night at 16°C after reaching OD 0.6 . Cells were spun down and resus-
pended in lysis buffer (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM imid-
azole, 1 mM PMSF, and PIC1/2; Sigma-Aldrich) and lysed via sonication. 
The lysate was spun down, the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant 
was loaded onto a modified His Column (GE Healthcare) containing cobalt 
instead of nickel. Proteins bound to the column were washed once with lysis 
buffer and eluted in 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mM imidazole, 
1 mM PMSF, and PIC1/2. </p>

<p>In vitro cosedimentation assays 
Keratin filaments were assembled from purified recombinant type I and 
type II keratins (Lee and Coulombe, 2009). In brief, purified heterotypic kera-
tin complexes (1:1 molar ratio) were serially dialyzed from Urea-containing 
to final assembly buffer (Lee and Coulombe, 2009). His-Src (Abcam) was 
diluted in Src kinase buffer (60 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mM MaCl 2 , and 5 mM 
MnCl 2 ) to a 10-ng/µL final concentration. His-Src, Src CD (Seeliger et al., 
2005), active His-Src, or His-GFP-Src domain fusions (total protein of 100 ng) 
were then incubated with 25 µg BSA or 25 µg of keratin filaments in a vol-
ume of 100 µl (final keratin concentration of 0.25 mg/ml). Samples were 
immediately spun at 160,000 g in a table-top airfuge (Beckman Coulter) 
for 30 min at room temperature. Supernatants were collected and diluted 
in an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer, and pellet fractions were 
recovered by incubation with 2× SDS sample buffer. Fractions were 
analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting to detect Src or 
GFP-tagged proteins. </p>

<p>Far-Western assays 
Purified recombinant keratin proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and 
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, as for standard immunoblotting 
assays. Membranes were then incubated with select ligands, as previously de-
scribed (modified from Lee and Coulombe [2009]). Membrane-immobilized 
keratin samples were blocked for 30 min in 5% milk and incubated with 
either His-Src, activated His-Src, His-GFP-SH3 (each at final concentration 
of 0.3 µg/ml), or His-GFP-SH2 (final concentration of 0.03 µg/ml) in 5% 
BSA for 4 h at room temperature. Membranes were then blocked further for 
an additional 30 min, after which primary antibody (in 5% BSA) was 
added overnight at 4°C. Blots were then treated according to standard 
HRP-based immunoblotting protocols. </p>

<p>Sequestration assays 
His-Src or Src CD (Seeliger et al., 2005) was incubated for 30 min at room 
temperature with reconstituted K6/K17 filaments, as described for cosedi-
mentation assays. After initial incubation, ATP was added (final concen-
tration of 20 µM), and activation and autophosphorylation of Src were 
allowed to proceed for 10 min. Phosphorylation was then quenched by 
addition of 2× SDS sample buffer. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE and </p>

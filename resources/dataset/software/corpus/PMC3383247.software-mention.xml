<p>Background: It is important to know and decide when to end regimen for the quality of life of the patients. However, there is 
currently no clear agreement on when to terminate palliative chemotherapy. We investigated the duration between the last 
chemotherapy and death, and associated factors aff ecting patients receiving palliative care after the last chemotherapy. </p>

<p>Methods: We studied 242 patients who were put into palliative care ward after receiving chemotherapy and died during 
hospitalization from 2008 to 2009. Electronic medical records were used to gather information on demographic characteristics, 
types of primary cancer, and palliative chemotherapy. Th en we analyzed the relationship between the clinical characteristics of 
patients and interval between last chemotherapy and death. </p>

<p>Results: The average survival time of patients after referral to palliative care was 17.5 days; survival time after discontinuation 
of chemotherapy was 103 days. Also, 104 (43.0%) patients died within 3 months and 14 (5.8%) patients died within 1 month of 
persistent palliative chemotherapy. Chemotherapy on patients within 3 months from their death was not associated with the 
social characteristics of the population. </p>

<p>Conclusion: Th e patients who were referred to palliative care were found to have continued to receive chemotherapy within 3 
months before death. However, only a small number of patients received chemotherapy within 1 month before death, which 
confirms that futile chemotherapy that extends to the end of life was less frequent. Doctors should be able to recognize the 
implications of excessive and aggressive use of chemotherapy and should actively communicate with patients about therapeutic 
choices. </p>

<p>Th e incidence of cancer in Korea has increased 3% per year </p>

<p>from 1999 to 2007. About 160,000 new cancer cases occur every </p>

<p>year and mortality rate exceeds 140 per 100,000 people. 
1) Due </p>

<p>to ongoing development of new 'less toxic thus well tolerated' </p>

<p>drugs, anti-cancer chemotherapy until the end-of-life is gradually </p>

<p>increasing. 
2) However, an excessive chemotherapy can decrease </p>

<p>the quality of life of patients. Th erefore doctors should consider </p>

<p>gain and loss of chemotherapy administered to terminally ill </p>

<p>patients in the palliative care ward; whether to enforce appropriate </p>

<p>chemotherapy in a purpose of treating patients in palliative care </p>

<p>ward need to be discussed. </p>

<p>3,4)   Thus it is important to know and decide when to end </p>

<p>regimen for the quality of life of the patients. However, there is </p>

<p>currently no clear agreement on when to terminate palliative </p>

<p>chemotherapy. We therefore investigated the duration between </p>

<p>the last chemotherapy and death, and associated factors aff ecting </p>

<p>patients receiving palliative care aft er the last chemotherapy. </p>

<p>METHODS </p>

<p>1. Subjects </p>

<p>Subjects of this study are 309 patients who died during </p>

<p>hospitalization in the palliative care ward in Samsung Medical </p>

<p>Center from January 1, 2008 to May 31, 2009. Among these </p>

<p>patients, 67 patients were excluded due to following reasons: </p>

<p>2 patients were non-cancer terminal illness, 62 patients never </p>

<p>received anti-cancer chemotherapy since diagnosis of cancer and </p>

<p>3 patents has been initially registered in the palliative care ward </p>

<p>then re-treated with anti-cancer chemotherapy. Thus electronic </p>

<p>medical records of 242 patients have been studied in this </p>

<p>investigation. These patients had been treated with anti-cancer </p>

<p>chemotherapy more than once before referral to palliative care </p>

<p>unit. </p>

<p>2. Data Collection </p>

<p>Throughout the retrospective investigation of electronic </p>

<p>medical records, demographic characteristics such as age, sex </p>

<p>and level of education were obtained along with the type of </p>

<p>cancer, metastatic site, date of palliative care registration, Eastern </p>

<p>Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status </p>

<p>upon the last hospitalization, date of death, number of palliative </p>

<p>chemotherapy regimen, and the start and end date of the last </p>

<p>chemotherapy regimen. We defined palliative chemotherapy </p>

<p>as chemotherapy of which purpose is not to cure cancer but to </p>

<p>relieve symptoms or to prolong life. End of chemotherapy is </p>

<p>defi ned as the last administration of anti-cancer drug. Th e period </p>

<p>between the end of chemotherapy and death was calculated as </p>

<p>the number of days. </p>

<p>ECOG performance is a tool to evaluate performance status </p>

<p>of cancer patients. It is appraised in six grades: grade 0 (fully </p>

<p>active), grade 1 (restricted in physically strenuous activity but </p>

<p>ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary </p>

<p>nature), grade 2 (ambulatory and capable of all self-care but </p>

<p>unable to carry out any work activities. Up about more than </p>

<p>50% of waking hours), grade 3 (capable of only limited self-care; </p>

<p>confined to bed or chair 50% or more of waking hours), grade </p>

<p>4 (completely disabled; cannot carry on any self-care; totally </p>

<p>confi ned to bed or chair), grade 5 (death). </p>

<p>3. Statistical Analysis </p>

<p>To find out relationship between survival time since the </p>

<p>last palliative chemotherapy and patient characteristics, t-test </p>

<p>was used for parametric test and Mann-Whitney test was used </p>

<p>for non-parametric test. To validate univariate analysis between </p>

<p>groups according to the length of survival, chi-square test and </p>

<p>Fisher's exact test were used. <rs id="software-0" type="software">PASW</rs> (old: SPSS) ver. <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">18.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to analyze data. Two-tailed test </p>

<p>were done and signifi cance level was set for 0.05. </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>1. Baseline Characteristics of Study Subjects </p>

<p>Mean age of the study subjects was 58.5 (± 12.5) years. </p>

<p>Median days from the end of chemotherapy to registration of </p>

<p>palliative care were 64.5 days. Survival time after registration </p>

<p>in palliative care was 17.5 days and survival time after the </p>

<p>end of chemotherapy was 103 days. There were significant </p>

<p>diff erences between male and female in the number of palliative </p>

<p>chemotherapy regimen, level of education, and religion. </p>

<p>However there were no significant differences between male </p>

<p>and female in length of palliative chemotherapy, period from </p>

<p>the end of chemotherapy to the date of registration in palliative </p>

<p>care, ECOG performance at the time of registration in palliative </p>

<p>care, survival time aft er the end of chemotherapy and length of </p>

<p>survival after registration in palliative care. The highest number </p>

<p>of patients suffered from gastrointestinal cancers including </p>

<p>colorectal and stomach, which were 104 patients (43%), followed </p>

<p>by 37 lung cancer patients (15.3%), 27 hepatobilliary cancer </p>

<p>patients (11.2%) and 26 pancreatic cancer patients (10.7%) </p>

<p>differences between better performance status group (ECOG </p>

<p>2 or under) and poor performance status group (ECOG 3 or </p>

<p>above) in terms of duration of palliative chemotherapy, number of </p>

<p>chemotherapy regimen, duration from the last chemotherapy to </p>

<p>referral to palliative care and survival duration aft er referral (Table </p>

<p>3). </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>We found that 43% of terminally ill patients have received </p>

<p>chemotherapy within three months before death and 23% started </p>

<p>new regimen of chemotherapy within three months before death. </p>

<p>Th ese fi ndings were similar to the other previous studies. Several </p>

<p>studies have discussed chemotherapy near the end of life. Earle </p>

<p>and the colleagues reported that 11.6% of 210,000 patients had </p>

<p>received chemotherapy within two weeks before death 
5) and </p>

<p>Kao et al found that 8% and 18% of 750 terminally ill cancer </p>

<p>patients had received chemotherapy within 2 weeks and 4 weeks </p>

<p>before death, respectively. 
6) In Korea, a retrospective multi-</p>

<p>center study showed that 43.9% and 30.9% of 3,750 patients </p>

<p>had received chemotherapy within three and one month before </p>

<p>death, respectively. 
7) Another study by a tertiary care hospital in </p>

<p>Seoul showed that 50.3% and 5.7% of 298 patients had received </p>

<p>chemotherapy within 2 months and 2 weeks before death, </p>

<p>respectively. 
8) However, our study showed that 1.2 % of patients </p>

<p>received chemotherapy within two weeks before death and 5.8% </p>

<p>within one month before death, compared with the other study </p>

<p>showing up to 20% of patients did so within 2 weeks before </p>

<p>death. 
9) This difference may be explained by the fact that our </p>

<p>patients were referred to palliative care center thus treated less </p>

<p>aggressively, 
7,10) but the patients from other studies might not have </p>

<p>an access to palliative care. We found that the patients referred to </p>

<p>palliative care had few futile chemotherapy near the end of life. </p>

<p>However, it remains to be confirmed whether this finding had </p>

<p>some impact on improved survival or quality of life of patients. </p>

<p>Th e previous studies showed various relationships between </p>

<p>patient's factors and persistent chemotherapy near the end </p>

<p>of life and differed by socio-cultural conditions. Patients who </p>

<p>were older, female, and had an access to palliative care, received </p>

<p>less aggressive chemotherapy. 
2) Married patients received less </p>

<p>aggressive chemotherapy than unmarried patients. 
5) Patients who </p>

<p>were younger and had chemotherapy-sensitive tumors such as </p>

<p>gastrointestinal cancer, received more aggressive chemotherapy. </p>

<p>However, men rather than women received less aggressive </p>

<p>chemotherapy. 
6) Patients, who were symptomatic, under the </p>

<p>age of 45 and were not referred to palliative care, were likely to </p>

<p>continue receiving chemotherapy. 
10) College graduate chose less </p>

<p>aggressive treatment near the end of life in a study carried out in </p>

<p>Korea, 
7) but there were no relationship between educational level </p>

<p>and choice of chemotherapy in terminally ill cancer patients in a </p>

<p>study done in Netherlands. </p>

<p>11) </p>

<p>In this study, we could not find any association between </p>

<p>chemotherapy near the end of life and many patient factors such </p>

<p>as age, sex, religion, level of education, site of cancer and socio-</p>

<p>demographic factors only except performance status at the time </p>

<p>of registration in palliative care. This could be explained by a </p>

<p>small sample size. There were only 14 patients who underwent </p>

<p>chemotherapy during the last month of life and the number </p>

<p>of events was too small to find the related factors. Another </p>

<p>Vol. 33, No. 1 Jan 2012 | 49 </p>

<p>Korean J Fam Med </p>

<p>explanation is that the patients of our study already opted for </p>

<p>palliative care. Selection of palliative care can be a strong factor to </p>

<p>deny chemotherapy near the end of life. It is also consistent with a </p>

<p>previous study on patients with metastatic cancer, which showed </p>

<p>that patients considering a quality of life were likely to receive </p>

<p>fewer chemotherapy and gett ing chemotherapy had no signifi cant </p>

<p>association with gender, age, and level of education. </p>

<p>11) </p>

<p>We could not analyze the effect of physician factors on </p>

<p>chemotherapy near the end of life, but the role of physician is </p>

<p>important in doing aggressive chemotherapy until the end of life </p>

<p>in Korea, considering that referral to palliative care is mostly done </p>

<p>when there are no further chemotherapy options available. </p>

<p>12)   One study reported that doctors felt uncomfortable in offering </p>

<p>palliative care to advanced cancer patients but felt easier in </p>

<p>discussing another chemotherapy options. 
13) Also a study on </p>

<p>95 incurable advanced cancer patients showed that only 39% </p>

<p>of patients were told of their prognosis by their physician even </p>

<p>though they were already getting palliative chemotherapy. 
14) As </p>

<p>physician's lack of eff ort to communicate with patients can cause </p>

<p>futile chemotherapy near the end of life, further study is needed </p>

<p>on the association of physician factors with chemotherapy near </p>

<p>the end of life. </p>

<p>It is difficult to generalize our findings as this was a </p>

<p>retrospective study conducted at a single tertiary hospital. </p>

<p>Another limitation of this study is that impact of chemotherapy </p>

<p>near the end of life on the quality of life cannot be evaluated </p>

<p>directly. However, several studies have already reported that </p>

<p>there was more harm in doing chemotherapy near the end of </p>

<p>life. 
3,4) Also we could not obtain objective data on purpose and </p>

<p>effectiveness of palliative chemotherapy as wells as reason for </p>

<p>starting or continuation of chemotherapy, thus it was impossible </p>

<p>to assess whether the chemotherapy were appropriate or </p>

<p>excessive. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, this study has advantages as it examined </p>

<p>patients receiving palliative care and discussed differences </p>

<p>with other existing studies. The existing studies reported that </p>

<p>availability of palliative care 
2) or providing information on </p>

<p>palliative care 
10) played an important role in patient's decision-</p>

<p>making on treatment and reduced likelihood of receiving </p>

<p>aggressive chemotherapy. Th us it is thought to be meaningful to </p>

<p>find out current situation of chemotherapy near the end of life </p>

<p>among the patients at palliative care unit. </p>

<p>In conclusion, authors found there was no difference </p>

<p>on administration of chemotherapy within 3 months before </p>

<p>death between palliative care group in this study and usual care </p>

<p>group from other studies. However, less chemotherapy were </p>

<p>administered to the patients within one month before death in </p>

<p>this study. It is postulated that earlier referral to palliative care </p>

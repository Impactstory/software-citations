<p>ABSTRACT </p>

<p>5-Aza-2 
0 -deoxycytidine (5azaC-dR) has been em-
ployed as an inhibitor of DNA methylation, a chemo-
therapeutic agent, a clastogen, a mutagen, an 
inducer of fragile sites and a carcinogen. However, 
its effects are difficult to quantify because it rapidly 
breaks down in aqueous solution to the stable 
compound 2 
0 5-Azacytidine (5azaC-R) is a multifaceted drug that has 
been characterized as a mutagen (1-3), clastogen (4), car-
cinogen (5) and epimutagen in mammalian cells (6). It can 
elicit massive chromatin restructuring (7,8), and can elicit </p>

<p>re-expression of silent genes regardless of their promoter 
methylation state (9). These effects are thought to be 
associated with its capacity to produce demethylated 
DNA via in vivo reduction to 5-aza-2 
0 -deoxycytidine 
(5azaC-dR) and incorporation into DNA, where its 
capacity for epigenetic and genetic damage (10) is 
associated with the trapping (11) and subsequent destruc-
tion of DNA methyltransferase 1 (12). 
The lability of both 5azaC-R and 5azaC-dR in aqueous 
media is well known. Both are rapidly hydrolyzed to the 
2 
0 -deoxyriboguanylurea forms (GuaUre-R and GuaUre-
dR) in aqueous media at neutral pH (13) with a half-life 
of about 10 h. Its half-life in DNA is predicted to be 
slightly longer although reliable measurements of its sta-
bility in DNA are unavailable. Direct evidence for the 
presence of 5azaC in DNA isolated from prokaryotic or 
eukaryotic cells exposed to either 5azaC-R or 5azaC-dR 
has not been obtained. Incorporation into DNA has been 
inferred from the more pronounced biological effects of 
5azaC-dR compared with 5azaC-R (14) and the capacity 
of isolated DNA to contain tightly bound proteins (15). 
The genetic evidence is consistent with the predicted 
chemical breakdown since both 5azaC-R and 5azaC-dR 
mutagenesis produces a significant number of C:G ! G:C 
transversion and C:G ! T:A transition mutations in both 
bacteria (1) and mammals (10). Transversions are best 
explained by the capacity of GuaUre-dR in DNA to 
pair with cytosine as proposed by Jackson-Grusby et al. 
(10), while the transition mutations are consistent with 
either bypass synthesis after glycolytic removal of 
GuaUre-dR or mispairing of GuaUre-dR or 5azaC-dR 
with dA. 
In principle, GuaUre-dR could be generated by the 
breakdown of 5azaC-R incorporated as a cytidine 
analog forming a GuaUre-dR:dG mispair. Alternatively, </p>

<p>it could be incorporated directly into DNA as an analog 
of either deoxycytidine or deoxyguanine. Most protocols 
(16) employing 5azaC-R to study bacterial cells require 
exposure to the drug over a short period (1-5 h). Thus, 
5azaC-R incorporated into DNA as a cytidine analog is 
expected to account for the bulk of the incorporation in 
these experiments. In contrast, 5azaC-R protocols for 
studies in eukaryotic cells require prolonged exposure 
(24-72 h) to 1 mM drug in aqueous solution where it is 
rapidly hydrolyzed to GuaUre-dR that may be 
incorporated directly into DNA. 
Here, we report synthetic approaches to the production 
of pure GuaUre-dR, its phosphoramidite, and oligo-
deoxynucleotides containing GuaUre-dR at preselected 
sites. We used these syntheses to show that GuaUre-dR 
in DNA was a potent inhibitor of Human DNA 
Methyltransferase 1 (hDNMT1) and the bacterial 
DNA methyltransferase (M.EcoRII), and that direct 
exposure of human cells to GuaUre-dR can produce 
both demethylation (epimutation) and mutation. Direct 
exposure of human cells to GuaUre-dR was also found 
to mimic the ability of 5azaC-dR in the induction of 
fragile sites FRA1J and FRA9E that were previously 
thought to be uniquely induced by 5azaC-R or 
5azaC-dR. We used PCR mapping to study the 
base-pairing spectrum generated during amplification at 
sites of GuaUre-dR incorporation in the template 
strand. Those results suggest that GuaUre-dR mediated 
mutagenesis mimics 5azaC-R and 5azaC-dR mediated 
mutagenesis in that it produces both C:G ! G:C 
transversions and C:G ! T:A transitions. </p>

<p>MATERIALS AND METHODS </p>

<p>Reagents </p>

<p>Phosphoramidite synthesis (overview) 
We noted that GuaUre oligodeoxynucleotides are not 
stable during standard ammonium deprotection. Thus, 
p-nitrophenylethyl (NPE) and p-nitrophenylethoxy-
carbonyl (NPEOC) protecting groups (17) were used in 
the synthesis of the GuaUre-dR phosphoramidite. The 
NPEOC protected phosphoramidite of GuaUre-dR 
(Figure 1) was prepared by transglycosylation of 5 
0 ,3 
0 -O-
(1,1,3,3-tetraisopropyldisiloxane-1,3-diyl)-2 
0 -deoxyuridine 
(13) with silylated 5-azacytosine in the presence of 
trimethylsilyl trifluoromethansulfonate as the catalyst in 
anhydrous DCM. The -anomer of 5 
0 ,3 
0 -O-(1,1,3,3-
tetraisopropyldisiloxane-1,3-diyl)-5-aza -2 
0 -deoxycytidine, 
was separated from the remaining substrate and from 
the -amoner by silica gel chromatography. Ammonium 
hydroxide treatment of triazine ring gave the required 
GuaUre intermediate. Acylation at the amino positions 
of GuaUre was achieved by reaction with excess of 
2-(4-nitrophenyl)-ethyl chloroformate (17). The removal 
of 5 
0 ,3 
0 -TIPDS-protecting groups, was performed with 
tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride or TAS-F (18). Use of 
more stable TIPDS instead of commonly employed 
trimethylsilyl group helped with a,b-anomer separation 
during silicagel purification (19). Reactions of NPEOC 
protected GuaUre-dR with DMTr-Cl followed by </p>

<p>reaction 
with 
bis-[N,N-diisopropylamino-2-(4-nitro-
phenyl)]ethoxyphosphane (19) gave the required 
phosphoramide. The remaining NPE, NPEOC-phospho-
ramidites were prepared as described in (17,20). Direct

evaporated twice with toluene to remove the reminder of 
pyridine. The residue was dissolved in dichloromethane 
(DCM) (100 ml) and washed with water, dried under 
Na 2 SO 4 . The filtrates were combined and evaporated to 
dryness in vacuum. The residue was purified on a silica gel

for 3 h under an argon atmosphere, until the suspension 
was mostly dissolved. After the reaction mixture was 
cooled to room temperature trimethylsilyl trifluoro-
methanesulfonate (2.72 ml, 15 mmol) was added and the 
reaction was refluxed for additional 6 h under an argon 
atmosphere. It was then diluted with 60 ml of DCM and 
extracted with an ice-cold solution of brine. The organic 
layer was dried (Na 2 SO 4 ) and the solvents were removed 
under reduced pressure. The -anomer was separated 
from remaining substrate and -anomer using a silica gel

<p>Oligodeoxynucleotide synthesis </p>

<p>Oligomers were prepared on the 1 mmol scale with a 
Cyclon Plus DNA Synthesizer using phosphoramidites 
with NPE and NPEOC protecting groups. Nucleosides 
with NPE/NPEOC (17) were attached to controlled-pore 
glass (CPG) through an oxalyl linkage as described in 
(21,22). All phosphoramidites were dissolved in anhyd-
rous DCM to obtain a 0.04 M solution. Standard 
reagents and cycles were used for the synthesis with modi-
fication of coupling time from 30 s to 3 min. DMTr groups 
were removed after synthesis. Deprotection was carried 
out by using the non-nucleophilic base 1,8-
diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene DBU (0.5 M) in anhydrous 
pyridine containing 5 mg thymine for 15 h at room tem-
perature (18). The reaction was neutralized with glacial 
acetic acid and concentrated to dryness. The residues 
were washed with water and purified by HPLC. HPLC 
purification was performed on a PRP-1 column using </p>

<p>the following solutions: A: 10% acetonitrile (AcCN) in 
40 mM tetrabutylammonium acetate (TBAA), pH 6.5; B: 
90% AcCN in 40 mM TBAA, pH 6.5. Flow rate: 
2.5 ml/min, 20 min linear gradient from 0% B to 90%B. 
Purity of collected 1 ml fractions was checked by PAGE. 
Pure fractions were combined and desalted on HPLC 
using the following solvents: A: 2% AcCN in 50 mM 
triethylammonium acetate (TEAA), pH 6.5; B: 90% 
AcCN in 50 mM TEAA, pH 6.5. Flow rate: 2.5 ml/min, 
20 min, linear gradient from 0% B to 90% B followed by 
isopropanol precipitation. Oligodeoxynucleotides, con-
taining GuaUre ran as single 30-mers on 19% denaturing

above. </p>

<p>Human DNMT1 purification </p>

<p>HeLa S3 cells (2.9 Â 10 
9 cells) were purchased from the 
National Cell Culture Center (Biovest International, 
Minneapolis, MN, USA). Nuclear extracts were 
prepared as described in (23) except that Tris buffer was 
used instead of HEPES to give a protein concentration of 
10 mg/ml (total 85 mg of protein). The nuclear extract was 
then applied to Ä KTApurifier 
Õ System (GE Healthcare) 
using a 5 ml Hi-Trap DEAE-FF column (17 mg protein/ 
ml, GE Healthcare) followed by a Hi-Trap SP FF 
(1 ml, GE Healthcare) (24). Protein was eluted with a 
linear gradient from 100 mM to 1 M NaCl. Fractions con-
taining protein were pooled and applied to a hydroxyapa-
tite column (1 Â 1) equilibrated with buffer A: 10 mM KPi, 
50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.8, 0.08 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM bME, 
25% v/v glycerol. The column was washed with 10 ml of 
the same buffer and eluted with buffer B: 500 mM KPi 
50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.8, 0.08 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM bME, 
25% v/v glycerol). Enzyme activity was measured as pre-
viously described (25). The purified enzyme had a specific 
activity of 20.96 fmol/min/mg. </p>

<p>M.EcoRII purification </p>

<p>EcoRII-Trx (BL21 cells) were grown following the proced-
ure described in (26) using Super Broth medium with 
AMP50. After reaching 0.8 OD600 they were induced 
with 1 M IPTG. A total of 100 g of EcoRII-Trx cells 
were suspended in 500 ml of Buffer A (10 mM Potassium </p>

<p>Phosphate pH = 7, 1 mM EDTA, 7 mM bME) containing 
400 mM NaCl, 25 mg/l PMSF. The cells were treated with 
30 mg/l of lysozyme for 15 min at 4 
C, sonicated 5 times 
for 1.5 min and centrifuge with type Ti70 rotor at 
100 000g at 4 
C for 1H. The pooled supernatant was 
dilute 1.5-fold with Buffer A and loaded into 350 ml of 
P-11 cellulose column at 2 ml/min. The column was 
washed with 200 ml of Buffer A with 200 mM NaCl, 
then linear gradient with 65 ml Buffer A with 200 mM 
NaCl and 65 ml Buffer A with 800 mM NaCl followed 
by 500 ml of Buffer A with 800 M NaCl. The fractions 
containing enzyme were dialyzed overnight against 10 
volumes of Buffer A. Dialysate was centrifugated at 
10 000g for 15 min in a JA-17 rotor. The supernatant 
was applied on Ä KTApurifier 
TM System (GE Healthcare) 
using 5 ml Hi-Trap DEAE-FF column (0.4 mg protein/ml, 
GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Buffer A with 50 mM 
NaCl. The enzyme was eluted with 50 ml linear gradient of 
50 mM to 400 mM NaCl in Buffer A. The fractions con-
taining enzyme activity were pooled and applied to a 30 ml 
of DEAE-Sepharose column at 2.5 ml/min. The column 
was washed with 150 ml of Buffer A with 50 mM NaCl 
and the enzyme was eluted within linear gradient of 65 ml 
Buffer A with 50 mM NaCl and 65 ml Buffer A with </p>

<p>400 mM NaCl. The fractions containing enzyme were 
pooled together and applied to a hydroxyapatite column 
(0.12 ml HAP/ml supernatant) equilibrated with buffer A 
with 200 mM NaCl. The column was washed with 25 ml of 
Buffer A with 200 mM and the enzyme was eluted with

and concentrated over a second HAP column. Purified 
enzyme had a specific activity of 92.26 fmol/min/mg. </p>

<p>Microfluidics retardation </p>

<p>The DNA 7500 LabChip (Agilent) was used for the detec-
tion of retardation products as previously described (27). 
Duplex oligodeoxynucleotides, S 0 , S 2 , S 3 (Table 1) 
(c = 2.5 mM) were incubated with EcoRII Methyltrans-
ferase in 50 mM Tris pH = 7.8, 10 mM EDTA, 5 mM 
bME with 80 mM cold SAM at 37 
C for 2.5 h in 10 ml of 
the reaction volume. 
QPCR: Cycle times, reaction conditions and primer and 
probe syntheses were as previously described (28). All 
PCR reactions were carried out on a Rotor Gene 3000 
QPCR system (Corbett Life Sciences, Mortlake, NSW 
Australia). Software provided by the manufacturer was 
used in data collection and C t analyses. 
QPCR Standards: Cloned plasmid standards were used 
as previously described (28). </p>

<p>Cell culture, drug treatment and DNA isolation </p>

<p>PC-3 cells were grown at 37 
C with humidity and 5% 
CO 2 , in RPMI Medium 1640 (Irvine Scientific, Santa 
Ana, CA, USA) containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum 
and standard antibiotics (10 000 U penicillin and 10 ng/ 
ml streptomycin in 0.9% NaCl; Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, 
MO, USA). Cells were passaged using 0.25% trypsin 
EDTA (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), at 1:3 to 1:6. 
The PC-3 cells were exposed to 5azaC-dR or GuaUre-dR 
at a concentration of 1 mM. After 48 h, the cells were re-
plenished with fresh media containing fresh drug at the 
same concentration. Photos of both sets of treated cells 
were taken using an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse 
TS100) 1, 24, 48 and 72 h after the cells were exposed to 
the drugs. At each time point after the photos were taken, 
the cells were counted, trypsinized, and spun at 1000 g for 
5 min. The cell pellet was stored at À80 
C until DNA ex-
traction and bisulfite treatment. A set of plates with un-
treated PC-3 cells were also photographed, counted, 
trypsinized and stored at each time point in order to 
monitor normal growth and behavior under the same con-
ditions. DNA was isolated from cultured cells using </p>

<p>Qiagen's QIAamp DNA Blood mini kit also as previously 
described (28). </p>

<p>Cell culture methods and cytotoxicity measurements </p>

<p>For cytotoxicity associated with Fragile Site production, 
PC-3 cells grown on separate plates were exposed to 
varying concentrations of GuaUre-dR in duplicate. 
Another set of plates was left untreated, in order to 
monitor normal growth and behavior of the PC-3 cells 
under the same conditions. After the addition of 
GuaUre-dR, the plates with varying concentrations of 
GuaUre-dR were incubated for 7 h under the conditions 
above as a control for fragile site induction and with 
varying concentrations of GuaUre-dR for 48 h as a 
control for methylation inhibition. Harvested cells were 
counted using a hemocytometer, and trypan blue (Sigma 
Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri, USA) exclusion was used to 
determine cell viability. </p>

<p>Fragile site induction and cytogenetic analysis </p>

<p>5AzaC-dR or GuaUre-dR was dissolved in nuclease-free 
water to give 9 mg/ml stock solution. For each experiment, 
four cultures of the normal cell line RI-EBV, established 
from lymphocytes from a normal male peripheral blood 
sample (Karyotype 46XY), grown in RPMI supplemented 
with 15% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% Pen/Strep were 
set up and exposed to the drugs at varying concentrations: 
10 
À3 M, 10 
À4 M, 10 
À5 M and 0 M. Freshly prepared 
5azaC-dR or GuaUre-dR was added to separate 10 ml 
cell cultures and incubated at 37 
C for 7 h. They were 
exposed to colcemid for 40 min (during the last 40 min 
of 7 h drug exposure) to inhibit microtubule formation 
and arrests cells in metaphase. Cells were then harvested 
by standard methods and slides were prepared. After over-
night aging at 60 
C, slides were GTG banded and 50 
metaphase cells were scored at each drug concentration 
in each of 2 separate experiments for any evidence of fra-
gility. Each cell was counted and all chromosomes were 
evaluated for elongation or breaks. Metaphases were 
captured using <rs id="software-1" type="software">Bandview</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Applied Spectral Imaging, Carlsbad, CA, USA</rs>). </p>

<p>Bisulfite-mediated PCR </p>

<p>DNA methylation state was determined with the EZ DNA 
Methylation Kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA, USA) that 
was used to treat DNA with bisulfite as previously 
described (28). </p>

<p>Bisulfite sequencing </p>

<p>Methods used for gel isolation, cloning and sequencing 
has been have been previously described (29). Briefly, 
DNA fragments amplified after bisulfite mediated PCR 
were separated by gel electrophoresis (Figure 4B) and ex-
tracted using the QIAquick Gel extraction Kit (Qiagen). 
Isolated DNA was cloned using the PCR 2.1 TOPO 
Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) and plasmid DNA containing 
inserts of the appropriate size were sequenced on an 
ABI sequencer (Applied Biosystems) by the City of 
Hope DNA Sequencing Lab. </p>

45 ml and incubating them for 2 min at 94 
C, 5 min at 70 
C 
and for 5 min at 50 
C, then the duplex was allowed to cool 
to room temperature. The duplex was diluted to a final 
volume of 250 ml for a 1 mM duplex linker. 500 pmol of 
each 30-mer Duplex was phosphorylated with 10 U of 
T4 PNK (NEB) in 1 Â ligation buffer (NEB). Two micro-
liters of each phosphorylated oligo was added to 10 ml of 
TE pH 7.5 and annealed under the same temperature con-
ditions as the linkers. Then, 1ml of phosphorylated 
annealed 30-mer duplex was ligated to 1 ml 1 mM linker 
with 5 U of T4 ligase (NEB), in 1 Â ligation buffer 
(NEB) in a final volume of 15 ml. This was incubated over-
night at 4 
C. The ligated DNA was then treated with the 
Qiagen reaction cleanup kit, and the DNA was eluted in 
15 ml of pure water. The eluted DNA was used for PCR, 
with 0.25 U of Hotstar Taq (Qiagen), 10 ml of 10 Â Taq 
Buffer (Qiagen), 8 ml 25 mM MgCl 2 , 1.6 ml of 10 mM 
dNTPs (Roche), 1 ml 100 mM linker 2 in a final volume 
of 100 mL. The PCR conditions were 55

turer's instructions. Plasmids with inserts of the appropri-
ate size were sequenced at the City of Hope DNA 
Sequencing Lab as previously described (30). </p>

<p>Detection of mutations at the APC locus </p>

APC gene sequences from the untreated PC3 DNA and 
from PC3 DNA treated with 5-azacytidine or deoxy-
guanylurea were amplified through 50 cycles of: 95 
C for 
15 s, 56 
C for 30 s, 72 
C for 30 s. The band corresponding 
to the 318 bp product was gel-extracted using the QIAquick 
gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Once 
isolated, 4 ml of the Eluted Gel extract was used for 
cloning with the TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), as 
described by the manufacturer. The resulting colonies 
were inoculated into liquid cultures and plasmid DNA 
was isolated from each. Plasmids with inserts of the appro-
priate size were sequenced at the City of Hope DNA 
Sequencing Lab as previously described (30). </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>Effects of the breakdown product in DNA </p>

<p>We suspected that GuaUre-dR itself might account for the 
inhibition of DNA methyltransferase. To test this idea, we 
prepared the NPE, NPEOC-GuaUre-dR phosphoramidite 
(Figure 1), high-yield syntheses of single-stranded oligode-
oxynucleotides containing GuaUre-dR were easily 
achieved with the NPE, NPEOC-GuaUre-dR phospho-
ramidite and corresponding NPE, NPEOC-phospho-
ramidites of the other bases. </p>

<p>Inhibition of bacterial DNA methyltransferase 
(M.EcoRII) and human DNA methyltransferase I by 
DNA containing GuaUre-dR </p>

<p>Purified M.EcoRII was dramatically inhibited by 
GuaUre-dR in duplex S 3 at the targeted cytosine in its 
CCWGG recognition site (Figure 2A), while hDNMT1 
was dramatically inhibited by GuaUre-dR at the targeted 
C in a CG recognition site in duplex S 5 (Figure 2B) or at a 
mispair in a non-CG site in duplex S 6 (Figure 2C). The 
inhibition kinetics for each enzyme were best fit by com-
petition between the productive substrate with dC targeted 
by the methyltransferase and the non-productive substrate 
with GuaUre-dR targeted by the enzyme. Figure 2 shows 
the kinetics of the methyltransferase reaction when either 
dC or GuaUre-dR is targeted by a symmetrically placed 
5-methylcytosine residue in hemimethylated DNA. 
Kinetic parameters for the hemimethylated reaction tar-
geting dC are easily determined from the saturation plot 
for that substrate. However, the hemimethylated reaction 
targeting GuaUre-dR is very slow, making exact deter-
mination of the Km for the GuaUre-dR targeted substrate 
uncertain. To obtain kinetic parameters for this substrate, 
reaction rates were determined for a fixed concentration of 
the hemimethylated dC targeted substrate in the presence 
of varying amounts of hemimethylated GuaUre-dR 
targeted substrate. The kinetics are described by the fol-
lowing rate equation (31): </p>

oration (99.58 fmol/min = 100%) was achieved with duplex S 4 alone.

<p>Microfluidics retardation of DNA methyltransferase by 
GuaUre-containing oligodeoxynucleotides </p>

<p>The kinetic data above strongly suggests that DNA 
methyltransferase binds tightly GuaUre containing 
oligodeoxynucleotides. To further support this inference, 
we performed microfluidics retardation experiments with 
GuaUre-dR containing oligodeoxynucleotides (Figure 3). 
In this experiment, the GuaUre-dR targeted duplex S 3 was 
found to be retarded by M.EcoRII to the same extent as 
the control 5FdC targeted duplex S 2 known to tightly bind 
DNA methyltransferases (27). Binding with GuaUre-dR 
appeared somewhat less effective than binding to 5FdC, 
suggesting that the enzyme may select only one of the 
solution conformations adopted by GuaUre-dR. </p>

<p>Demethylation of human DNA by GuaUre-dR </p>

<p>Unlike 5azaC-R (32) and 5azaC-dR, GuaUre-dR did not 
appear to have an effect on bacterial growth (not shown), 
however, we noted that both of 5azaC-dR and 
GuaUre-dR were strong inhibitors of the growth of 
human prostate cancer cells. Moreover, both compounds 
effectively inhibited DNA methylation at genes inspected 
by methylation sensitive PCR. The time course of 
demethylation at a representative promoter is depicted 
in Figure 4. </p>

<p>Induction of 5AzaC-dR type fragile sites by GuaUre-dR </p>

<p>Experiments comparing the pattern of fragile site 
induction by 5azaC-dR (Figure 5B) and GuaUre-dR 
(Figure 5C) with untreated normal cells (Figure 5A) de-
monstrate that the well-known fragile sites FRA1J and 
FRA9F (7) are induced by either compound administered 
at identical concentrations. The results of two independent 
experiments were quantified by determining the number of 
metaphases out of the 50 examined that contained fragile 
sites (Table 2). In terms of the total number of fragile sites 
observed (0 observed in 100 total metaphases with 
GuaUre-dR compared to 4 in 100 metaphases for 
5azaC-dR at 10 
À5 M and 32 observed in 100 total meta-
phases with GuaUre-dR compared to 10 in 100 meta-
phases for 5azaC-dR at 10 
À3 M) the breakdown product 
appears to be less effective at fragile site induction than 
5azaC-dR at low concentration and more effective at 
higher concentration. </p>

<p>Cytotoxicity of a representative prostate cancer cell line </p>

<p>As has been noted for 5azaC-dR, GuaUre-dR exhibits 
minimal toxicity to prostate cancer cells at low concentra-
tion (Figure 6). With GuaUre-dR, cytotoxicity depended 
on time of exposure. Essentially no cytotoxicity was 
observed with the drug over the range zero to 1 mM 
after 7 h of exposure used in detection of fragile sites. 
However, after 48 h of exposure, used in the detection of 
DNA methylation change significant cytotoxicity was 
observed at 0.5 mM with an apparent LD50 of $48 mM. </p>

separation pattern (Top). Lane scans for the lanes containing DNA methyltransferase are presented at the bottom of the figure. The FdC 
Targeted CCWGG duplex S 2 was used as an M.EcoRII binding reference. The GuaUre-dR targeted CCWGG duplex S 3 gave a comparable 
retardation pattern, while the control de novo CCWGG duplex S 0 was not retarded. </p>

<p>Nucleic Acids Research, 2012, Vol. 40, No. 19 9795 </p>

<p>Mutagenesis by GuaUre-dR </p>

<p>GuaUre-dR created by direct incorporation or by the in-
corporation and subsequent breakdown of 5azaC-dR is 
expected to produce transversion mutations based the 
ability of GuaUre-dR to pair with dC (10). Consequently, 
GuaUre-dR incorporated directly into DNA as a dG 
analog would be expected to be essentially non-mutagenic. 
We used PCR amplification of synthetic duplex oligodeox-
ynucleotides containing GuaUre-dR at preselected sites to 
infer probable replication base pairing at template sites 
containing GuaUre-dR (Figure 7). Based on this 
analysis the base pairing frequencies for GuaUre-dR 
were GuaUre-dR:dG ) GuaUre-dR:dA &gt; GuaUre-dR:-
dC, suggesting that Taq polymerase codes GuaUre-dR 
primarily as a dC analog during PCR amplification. It 
should be noted that in this analysis oligodeoxy-
nucleotides are expected to form tandem arrays after 
ligation in the ligation mediated PCR procedure. The 
clones isolated from oligodeoxynucleotides containing 
GuaUre-dR on only one of the two strands in the 
duplex generally contained tandem arrays of 2-5 copies 
of the oligodeoxynucleotide. However, tandem arrays 
were not observed when the input oligodeoxynucleotide 
contained GuaUre-dR on both strands. This clearly 
suggests that GuaUre-dR is a replication block to the 
Taq polymerase. 
Since GuaUre-dR was found to be an effective deme-
thylating agent in human cells, we tested a representative </p>

<p>gene for the presence of mutations after demethylation by 
GuaUre-dR. When a short (318 bp) region of the APC 
gene in PC3 cells was inspected after growth in 
GuaUre-dR containing medium, a significant number of 
transition, transversion, deletion and insertion mutations 
were detected (Figure 8). </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>Many studies have demonstrated that 5azaC-R and 
5azaC-dR are unstable in aqueous solution (13,33,34), 
however, studies on the stability 5azaC-dR in DNA 
have not been reported. The intrinsic stability of 
cytosine in B-DNA can be attributed largely to the 
activation energy associated with the formation of the 
dihydrocytosine intermediate required for hydrolytic 
deamination. In that case two sp3 carbons must be 
introduced into the cytosine ring forcing a dramatic 
disruption of the structure of the DNA double helix that 
is resisted by the stacking energy of the duplex. Low levels 
of cytosine hydrate formed in aqueous solution are 
expected. However, restoration of the cytosine ring by 
ß-elimination is favored by the stacking energy, hence 
cytosine deamination mutations are rare. In contrast, the 
dihydroazacytidine intermediate can form more easily 
than dihydrocytidine intermediate because C6 is more 
electrophilic in the triazine ring and because the deform-
ation of the ring is less pronounced because only one sp3 </p>

<p>carbon is formed as N5 remains essentially planar. 
Further, once formed the dihydroazacytidine intermediate 
is unstable and rapidly breaks down to the guanylurea 
restoring the planar system in duplex DNA. Essentially, 
the electrophilicity of 5azaC-dR in DNA can be viewed as 
driving nucleophilic attack and the stacking energy of the 
duplex can be viewed as driving the breakdown of the 
dihydroazacytidine intermediate. Consequently, 5azaC is 
expected to be intrinsically unstable in DNA. In short, the 
chemistry of the triazine ring in DNA strongly suggests 
that direct incorporation of 5azaC-dR in DNA will 
rapidly result in the production of GuaUre-dR at sites 
of incorporation, and that GuaUre-dR incorporated 
directly into DNA would produce the same end result: 
GuaUre-dR in DNA. 
This hypothesis is supported not only by the data pre-
sented here, but also by the literature on 5azaC action. </p>

<p>For example, the spectrum of mutations produced by 
5azaC-dR in treated mice includes C:G ! T:A transitions, 
C:G ! A:T transversions and an excess of C:G ! G:C 
transversions at the d(CG) site (10). One possible explan-
ation for the excess of C:G ! G:C transversions is that 
DNMT1 attacks 5azaC-dR in DNA followed by hydroly-
sis within the active site of the enzyme to produce 
formylated DNMT1 and GuaUre-dR at the CG site 
(10), allowing GuaUre-dR thus formed to code for dC 
at replication. Several lines of evidence argue against 
this model. First, the active site of DNMT1 is essentially 
impervious to water as demonstrated by the complete 
lack of cytosine deamination during catalytic methylation 
(35). Consequently, anhydrous nucleophilic attack at C6 
by the active site cysteine is expected to produce 
C6-DNMT dihydroazacytidine in equilibrium with a 
ring-open covalent intermediate (see Supplementary 
Figure S1). Second, substitution of the weaker serine nu-
cleophile for the cysteine at the active site of DNMT1 does 
not block its subsequent enzyme degradation (12). Third, 
the model does not account for the significant number of 
C:G ! T:A transitions and C:G ! A:T transversions that 
are detected after mutagenesis by 5azaC-dR (10). Fourth, 
in bacteria C:G ! A:T transversions and C:G ! G:C 
transversions are preferentially selected after 5azaC-R 
mutagenesis in the absence of methytransferase inter-
action (1). 
Given the tight binding of DNMT1 at sites of GuaUre-
dR substitution inferred from the kinetics of DNMT1 
inhibition by GuaUre-dR, the degradation of the 
enzyme is more likely associated with the removal of 
tight complexes formed with GuaUre-dR as has been 
observed with tight complexes formed between the 
DNMT1 and 2-pyrimidinone (36,37). The predominance 
of transversions in vivo would then be associated with 
either the removal of GuaUre-dR by DNA glycosylases 
or the formation of abasic sites followed by the incorpor-
ation of dA by bypass synthesis, or the mispairing of 
GuaUre-dR with dA (Figure 7). 
The mutational spectrum obtained after PCR amplifi-
cation of GuaUre-dR containing oligodeoxynucleotides 
measures base pairing propensities in the absence of 
repair since Taq polymerase lacks both exonuclease and 
glycosylase activities. That evidence clearly shows that 
copying by Taq polymerase favors GuaUre-dR:dG 
paring and not GuaUre-dR:dC paring during amplifica-
tion. Given that the ÁTm for each of these ring-open con-
formations relative to the dC:dG pair is comparable 
(Supplementary Table S1), we infer that the GuaUre-
dR:dG base pair is preferred because it most closely 
approximates the geometry of the dC:dG basepair (38). 
The in vivo mutational spectrum at the APC gene after 
exposure to GuaUre-dR strongly suggests that it is 
highly mutagenic. Transversions and deletions were 
produced at an aggregate frequency of 1.56 Â 10 
À3 /bp 
while transition mutations were detected at a lower aggre-
gate frequency 0.39 Â 10 
À3 /bp, suggesting that mutations 
generated by abasic sites formed after base excision are 
more prevalent than mispairing mutations in human cells. 
Although the base-pairing properties of GuaUre-dR 
provide the best explanation for the observed mutagenesis </p>

<p>by 5azaC-R in both bacteria (1) and mammals (10), as a 
ring-open base, it may not be a particularly good substrate 
for direct incorporation into DNA by mammalian DNA 
polymerases. However, direct incorporation of GuaUre-
dR is again made plausible by the ability of this drug to 
induce the 5-azacytidine-type chromosomal fragile sites: 
FRA1J and FRA9E (Figure 5, Table 2). These fragile 
sites have hitherto been uniquely associated the induction 
by 5azaC-R or 5azaC-dR. The possibility that 
GuaUre-dR is directly incorporated into DNA is sup-
ported by the similarity between fragile sites FRA1J and 
FRA9E and the 1qh and 9qh undercondensations often 
observed in ICF syndrome (39). Since ICF syndrome is 
caused by mutations in human DNMT3b it is reasonable 
to suspect that GuaUre-dR and 5azaC-dR are 
incorporated into DNA where they inhibit DNMT3b 
directly. However, the present data does not directly dem-
onstrate incorporation into DNA. Consequently, it 
remains possible that these drugs merely block a process 
involved in chromosome condensation that requires 
DNMT3b activity. In any event, the data reported here </p>

<p>clearly demonstrates that induction of these fragile sites is 
not unique to 5azaC-dR, and suggests that induction of 
fragile sites by GuaUre-dR, like 5azaC-dR induced muta-
genesis, is the result of its breakdown to GuaUre-dR, 
which can occur rapidly. In general, cell lines are treated 
with 5azaC-R or 5azaC-dR for between 3 and 5 days 
(40,41). During that time the concentration of either 
compound will decrease from 1 mM usually used to 1 nM 
while the concentration of GuaUre-R or GuaUre-dR will 
increase correspondingly to about 1 mM (13,33). 
Earlier work (42) showed no therapeutic benefit for 
GuaUre-R in an L1210 mouse tumor model. Given that 
the mammalian cytidine kinase is quite promiscuous (43) 
phosphorylation of either GuaUre-R or GuaUre-dR 
should be effective in mammalian cells. This suggests 
that the inability of GuaUre-R to kill L1210 cells in a 
mouse model (43) may reside in the inability of 
ribnucleotide reductase to convert the monophosphate 
GuaUre-RMP to GuaUre-dRMP. This is consistent with 
the relatively low LD50 associated with GuaUre-dR in 
PC3 prostate tumor cells, and with more recent studies 
showing that epigenetic therapy with 5azaC-dR alone 
was only moderately effective against solid tumor cells 
(44). Durable responses in solid tumors appear to 
require low doses of methyltransferase inhibitors in com-
bination with histone deacetylase inhibitors followed by a 
course of cytotoxic therapy (45), suggesting that epigenetic 
alterations induced by these drugs may sensitize tumors to 
subsequent cytotoxic thereapy. In any event, for a rapidly 
dividing cell culture, one can expect $10-20% of the input 
5azaC-dR to be incorporated into DNA where it will 
spontaneously hydrolyze to GuaUre-dR. 
Ultimately our results coupled with the results of 
Ghoshal et al. (12) suggest that GuaUre-dR is directly 
incorporated into DNA and/or created by hydrolysis of 
5azaC-dR in DNA. The resulting massive and random 
conversion of dG:dC base pairs to GuaUre-dR:dG or </p>

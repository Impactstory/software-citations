<p>Blocks in genetic programs required for terminal myeloid differentiation and aberrant proliferation characterize acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) cells. 1,25-Dihydroxy-vitamin D3 (VitD3) arrests proliferation of AML cells and induces their differentiation into 
mature monocytes. In a previous study, we showed that miR-26a was induced upon VitD3-mediated monocytic differentiation. 
Here, we identify E2F7 as a novel target of miR-26a. We show that E2F7 significantly promotes cell cycle progression and inhibits 
monocytic differentiation of AML cells. We also demonstrate that E2F7 binds the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 </p>

<p>CIP1/WAF1 </p>

<p>(cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A) promoter repressing its expression. Moreover, interfering with E2F7 expression results in 
inhibition of c-Myc (v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog) transcriptional activity. This leads to the downregulation 
of c-Myc transcriptional target miR-17-92 cluster, whose expression has a well-defined role in contributing to block monocytic 
differentiation and sustain AML cell proliferation. Finally, we show that the expression of E2F7 is upregulated in primary blasts 
from AML patients. Thus, these findings indicate that the newly identified miR-26a target E2F7 might have an important role in 
monocytic differentiation and leukemogenesis. 
essential roles in cell growth and proliferation through their 
ability to both positively and negatively regulate the expres-
sion of coding and noncoding genes. 
13,14 C-Myc (v-myc 
myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog) is frequently 
activated in AML and has an important role in the induction 
of leukemogenesis. </p>

<p>12 </p>

<p>Notably, c-Myc transcriptionally 
represses p21 
CIP1/WAF1 expression, thereby sustaining AML 
cell proliferation. Conversely, p21 
CIP1/WAF1 represses Myc 
transcriptional activity by interfering with its dimerization with 
Max protein. 
15 Repression of tumor-suppressing miRNAs is a 
fundamental component of the Myc tumorigenic program. 
One of the relevant miRNAs repressed by c-Myc in 
hematopoietic malignancies is miR-26a, 
16,17 which was 
shown to act as a tumor suppressor in different types of 
cancer. </p>

<p>18-22 </p>

<p>In a previous study, we showed that miR-26a was induced 
upon VitD3-mediated monocytic differentiation of AML cell 
lines. 
17 In addition, we have shown that miR-26a was 
downregulated in primary AML blasts and, if reconstituted in 
AML cell lines, was able to decrease proliferation and induce 
myeloid differentiation. 
17 However, the mechanism under-
lying this effect was not fully understood. Here, we identify the 
transcriptional repressor E2F7 as a novel target for miR-26a 
function in AML. We show that E2F7 promotes cell cycle 
progression and inhibits monocytic differentiation of AML 
cells. The repression of E2F7 by miR-26a contributes to the 
increased expression of p21 
CIP1/WAF1 observed during VitD3-
induced monocytic differentiation of AML cells. In addition, 
interfering with E2F7 expression results in inhibition of c-Myc 
activity and downregulation of the oncogenic miR-17-92 
cluster. Finally, we further show that, conversely to miR-
26a, the expression of E2F7 is upregulated in AML blasts. 
Therefore, we identified a new regulatory network that might 
have a relevant role in leukemogenesis. </p>

<p>Results </p>

<p>E2F7 is a direct target of miR-26a and is upregulated in 
AML. We previously showed that miR-26a negatively regulates 
cell proliferation and stimulates myeloid differentiation of AML 
cells. 
17 Notably, miR-26a negatively regulates G 1 /S transition 
in different tumors and this has been attributed, at least in 
part, to the direct regulation of EZH2 by miR-26a. </p>

<p>16,17,19,21 </p>

<p>However, we showed that EZH2 is not a direct target of 
miR-26a in AML cells. 
17 Thus, we decided to investigate 
novel relevant targets for miR-26a function in AML. Between 
the putative targets of miR-26a, we noticed the E2F7 trans-
cription factor (data from <rs id="software-0" type="software">TargetScan</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="url">www.targetscan.org</rs>) 
and Pictar (pictar.mdc-berlin.de)), an important regulator 
of the G 1 /S-phase transition. 
23 The 3'-untranslated region 
(3 
0 -UTR) of E2F7 contained two highly conserved putative 
binding sites for miR-26a (Figure 1a). To show the direct 
targeting of E2F7 by miR-26a, we constructed luciferase 
reporters containing the wild type (WT) 3 
0 -UTR of E2F7 (WT), 
the E2F7 3 
0 -UTR mutated at the miR-26a binding site I (Mut1), 
the E2F7 3 
0 -UTR mutated at the miR-26a binding site II (Mut2) 
or the E2F7 3 
0 -UTR mutated at both miR-26a binding sites 
(Mut1-2). Luciferase reporters were individually co-transfected 
in HeLa cells with a plasmid expressing miR-26a or control </p>

<p>(Figure 1b). The expression of WT reporter was significantly 
decreased by miR-26a compared with control. Reporter Mut1 
behaved similarly to WT, while deletion of Mut2 partially 
relieved translational repression. On the other hand, expres-
sion of the reporter construct mutated at both miR-26a 
binding sites of E2F7 3 
0 -UTR (Mut1-2) was not sensitive to 
miR-26a translational repression. This may be explained by 
the fact that the binding of miR-26a on site II increases the 
accessibility to site I or, alternatively, binding of one 
repressive complex on site II may serve as scaffold for 
attracting cofactors necessary for repression on site I. These 
results demonstrated that miR-26a regulated E2F7 expres-
sion through direct binding of the 3 
0 -UTR. 
To further demonstrate that miR-26a represses E2F7 
expression in AML, U937 cells were infected with a lentivirus 
containing an miR-26a expression cassette (Lenti-26a) or 
control (Mock inf.). Enforced expression by lentiviral transduc-
tion significantly increased miR-26a levels with a concomitant 
decrease in E2F7 protein levels (Figure 2a). Similar results 
were obtained with the HL-60 cell line (Supplementary 
Figure 1). Altogether, these data indicated that E2F7 is a 
direct target of miR-26a in AML. 
We also examined the expression levels of E2F7 protein 
and miR-26a during monocytic differentiation of U937 induced 
by VitD3 (Figure 2b). As expected, E2F7 protein levels 
decreased upon monocytic differentiation and are inversely 
correlated to miR-26a levels (Figure 2b). Similar results were 
obtained during monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells 
(Supplementary Figure 1). We previously showed that miR-
26a is downregulated in primary AML samples. 
15 Thus, we 
analyzed E2F7 expression levels in human monocytes 
isolated from healthy donors and diagnostic samples of AML 
patients by real-time RT-PCR (Figure 2c). We have restricted 
the analysis to M2, M4 and M5 FAB subtypes because they 
can respond to monocytic differentiation in vitro. 
3,4 High 
expression levels of E2F7 were detected in all AML samples 
compared with mature monocytes. These data indicated that 
E2F7 is upregulated in primary AML samples and that its 
expression is inversely correlated with miR-26a. </p>

<p>Decreased E2F7 levels stimulate monocytic differentiation 
and inhibit proliferation of AML cells. It has been 
previously demonstrated that miR-26a induced the expres-
sion of p21 
CIP1/WAF1 (Figure 2a) and, concomitantly, mono-
cytic differentiation of AML cell lines. 
17 Thus, we next 
investigated the role of E2F7 in monocytic cell differentiation. 
We selected U937 cells for further experiments because 
they have been extensively used as suitable model systems to 
study monocytic differentiation. These cells differentiate into 
mature monocytes by treatment with VitD3, a process mainly 
mediated by p21 
CIP1/WAF1 expression and subsequent G 0 /G 1 
cell cycle arrest. 
6,7 Cells were infected with lentiviral vectors 
expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against E2F7 
(L-shE2F7) or scramble shRNA (L-shSCR) and differentiation 
was evaluated by analyzing the morphology, immunopheno-
type and induction of specific molecular markers. Cells 
infected with Lenti-shE2F7 exhibited almost a complete 
depletion of E2F7 protein level (Figure 3a). Strikingly, the 
depletion of E2F7 induced drastic changes in the morphology </p>

<p>of transduced cells. A nuclear condensation and more 
abundant cytoplasm were observed, indicating an induction 
of myeloid differentiation (Figure 3b). Notably, cells interfering 
with E2F7 presented a more pronounced differentiation upon 
VitD3 treatment with a feature of matured monocytes/ 
macrophages, such us indented nuclei, increased cytoplas-
mic processes and granules. Immunophenotype was ana-
lyzed to further examine differentiation. A strong increase in 
cells expressing the surface markers, cluster of differentiation 
14 (CD14) and cluster of differentiation 11b (CD11b), which 
are upregulated during myelomonocytic differentiation, was 
observed upon depletion of E2F7 and treatment with VitD3 
(Figures 3c and d). We also measured mRNA expression 
levels for marker of monocytic differentiation such as M-CSF, 
M-CSFr and MafB (Figure 3e). We detected a strong increase 
in monocytic markers upon inhibition of E2F7 expression by 
RNAi, even in the absence of any inducer, indicating that the 
depletion of E2F7 is sufficient to commit U937 toward 
monocytic differentiation. Similar results were obtained with </p>

<p>HL-60 cells (Supplementary Figure 2). Altogether, these 
results indicate that decreased E2F7 levels stimulated 
monocytic/macrophage differentiation of AML cells. 
In AML, the terminal differentiation block is strictly related to 
aberrant proliferation. 
2 Thus, to better understand the activity 
of E2F7 in leukemic cells, we analyzed the effect of E2F7 on 
cellular proliferation and cell cycle. U937 cells infected with 
L-shE2F7 showed lower proliferation rate than control 
L-shSCR cells (Figure 4a). In addition, cell cycle analysis 
showed that silencing of E2F7 expression increased the 
percentage of cells in G 1 arrest and decreased the number of 
cells in the S phase (Figures 4b and c). Expression analysis of 
relevant cell cycle regulators by real-time PCR (qPCR) 
indicated that E2F7 silencing reduced the levels of several 
positive regulators of the G1 phase, including CDK2, CDK4 
and CDK6 (Figure 4d). Similar results were obtained with HL-
60 cells (Supplementary Figure 3). These data indicated that 
endogenous E2F7 could be essential for maintaining cellular 
proliferation of AML cells. </p>

<p>Increased E2F7 levels counteract monocytic differentia-
tion and stimulate proliferation of AML cells. We next 
evaluated whether enforced expression of E2F7 affected the </p>

<p>differentiation status and proliferation of AML cells. Thus, we 
cloned an E2F7 derivative with a 3 
0 -UTR devoid of miRNA 
target sites in a stable and Tet-on inducible system derived 
from the enhanced PiggyBac (ePiggyBac) transposon (EBP-
PURO) giving rise to the EBP-PURO-E2F7 construct. 
Doxycycline (Dox) treatment of U937 cells transformed with 
EBP-PURO-E2F7 increased the levels of E2F7 as compared 
with those transformed with the empty vector EBP-PURO 
(Figure 5a). Moreover, E2F7 overexpression is retained after 
VitD3 treatment, when endogenous E2F7 protein levels 
decreased (Figure 5a). High levels of E2F7 resulted in a 
reduction of VitD3-induced monocytic differentiation 
assessed by morphological changes and percentage of 
CD11-and CD14-positive cells compared to cells transfected 
with the empty vector (Figures 5c-e). Moreover, enforced 
E2F7 expression resulted in increased proliferation rate and 
percentage of cells in the S phase, while decreased the 
number of cells arrested in the G1 phase (Figures 5b, f and g). 
Notably, this effect is maintained even after VitD3 treatment 
(Figures 5f and g). Altogether, these data indicated that 
increased levels of E2F7 stimulated proliferation and 
counteracted monocytic differentiation of AML cells; there-
fore, suggesting that one of the pathways by which miR-26a </p>

A specific enrichment of the p21

reduced after VitD3 treatment or RNAi for E2F7, in

<p>miRNAs were significantly downregulated, and miR-17 and 
miR-20 levels are shown (Figure 7a). Interestingly, a 
decrease in miR-17 and miR-20 levels was also obtained 
upon enforced expression of miR-26a (Figure 7b). ChIP 
experiments showed that the binding of c-Myc on miR-17-92 
promoter region is strongly reduced after VitD3 treatment 
and downregulation of E2F7 levels (Figure 7c). These results 
suggested that E2F7 could contribute to maintain c-Myc 
activity and high level of the miR-17-92 cluster, therein 
sustaining the differentiation block and aberrant proliferation 
of AML cells. </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>AML cells are characterized by increased proliferation, block 
of differentiation programs and enhanced self-renewal. 
Insights into the molecular networks that control all these 
processes are critical to fully understand the leukemogenic 
process and develop effective therapies. 
MiRNAs are critical regulators of gene programs that 
control blood cell homeostasis. 
9 For this reason, it is not 
surprising that hematological malignancies are characterized 
by miRNA misregulation. 
9 A critical aspect for understanding 
miRNA function is to link specific miRNAs to their relevant 
targets. A preliminary study showed that miR-26a was </p>

<p>downregulated in AML by the oncogene c-Myc and that 
reconstitution of miR-26a in AML cell lines induced prolifera-
tion arrest and stimulated monocytic differentiation. 
17 This 
study identified as a novel target for miR-26a function in AML 
the transcriptional repressor E2F7. E2F7 belongs to the 
atypical E2F members, which were initially identified as a 
negative regulator of cell cycle progression. 
27 However, 
different studies revealed that atypical E2Fs might also act 
as a positive regulator of cellular proliferation. 
28-31 Here, for 
the first time, we showed that E2F7 expression was 
upregulated in AML primary blasts. Recently, E2F7 was 
found upregulated in rhabdomyosarcoma, indicating that 
E2F7 misregulation might have significant role in tumorigen-
esis. 
32 Herein, we demonstrated that E2F7 silencing in AML 
cell lines inhibited the cellular growth and induced monocytic 
differentiation. Conversely, enforced E2F7 expression stimu-
lated proliferation and counteracted monocytic differentiation. 
The E2F7 knockdown in AML cells delayed cell cycle 
progression and in particular G1/S transition, which was not 
consistent with previous data obtained in fibroblast. 
33 Notably, 
similar results have been described for the other atypical E2F 
factor E2F8 in hepatocellular carcinoma. 
28,34 This suggests 
that E2F7, like E2F8, could act as a positive or negative 
regulator of cell cycle progression in a cellular context-
dependent manner. Therefore, much more work will be </p>

<p>necessary to identify E2F7 interacting proteins and assign 
specific functions to E2F7 in different cell lineages. 
Importantly, both miR-26a overexpression and E2F7 
inhibition produces p21 
CIP1/WAF1 accumulation, a factor that 
has a crucial role in the proliferation arrest and monocytic 
differentiation of AML cells. 
6,8 We showed that the transcrip-
tional repressor E2F7 is able to bind to p21 
CIP1/WAF1 promoter 
region in proliferating AML cells; thus, sustaining the 
differentiation block of AML cells by inhibiting p21 </p>

<p>CIP1/WAF1 </p>

<p>expression. In summary, we propose a model in which the 
translational repression of E2F7 by miR-26a could contribute 
to a detachment of E2F7 from p21 
CIP1/WAF1 promoter and, in 
turn, to the induction of p21 
CIP1/WAF1 expression during VitD3-
mediated differentiation of AML cell lines. It is worth noting that 
just as E2F7 is just one of the hundreds of potential targets of 
miR-26a, p21 
CIP1/WAF1 is just one of the downstream effectors </p>

<p>of E2F7. Further studies will be needed to understand the 
relevance of this model in normal monocytopoiesis and AML. 
Previous studies have shown that the transcriptional activity 
of c-Myc is inhibited by p21 
CIP1/WAF1 protein. 
15 c-Myc 
transcriptionally activates the oncogenic miR-17-92 cluster, </p>

<p>33 </p>

<p>containing miRNAs known to inhibit monocytic/macrophage 
differentiation of both normal myeloid progenitors and AML 
cells. 
25,26 Moreover, increased expression of miR-17-92 has 
been reported in AML patients where it helps to maintain self-
renewal of leukemic cells. 
26,35 Our studies showed that, in our 
cellular system, E2F7 contributed to control miR-17-92 
expression. Indeed, E2F7 inhibition is sufficient to produce a 
decrease of miR-17-92. This suggests a model in which E2F7 
could control miR-17-92 expression through the inhibition of 
c-Myc activity by p21 </p>

<p>CIP1/WAF1 </p>

<p>. However, further experiments 
will be needed to clarify the relation between p21 
CIP1/WAF1 , 
c-Myc and miR-17-92 expression. Notably, the p21 </p>

<p>CIP1/WAF1 </p>

<p>mRNA is also a target of the miR-17 family. 
26,35,36 Conse-
quently, the decreased expression of miR-17-92 might 
contribute to enforce p21 
CIP1/WAF1 expression during AML 
cell differentiation. This indicates that upregulation of E2F7 
could contribute to oncogenesis in AML by maintaining high 
levels of miR-17-92. 
In conclusion, this study identified a novel aspect of VitD3 
action in regulating proliferation and differentiation of AML 
cells through the miR-26a/E2F7/p21 
CIP1/WAF1 network. How-
ever, it should be considered that the level of complexity of 
gene regulation during these processes is such that no single 
circuitry operates in isolation and they are very likely part of 
fully integrated networks within the cells. Therein, the 
biological effect of a specific miRNA strongly depends on 
the cellular context. In particular, miR-26a has been shown to 
induce proliferation arrest in different tumor model systems, 
such as lymphomas and liver, breast and nasopharyngeal 
carcinomas. 
16,17,21,22,37 Conversely, it has been shown to act 
as an oncogene in glioblastoma. 
38 An important aspect to 
consider in using miR-26a as an antitumor molecule in AML is 
that p21 
CIP1/WAF1 not only has a relevant role in the 
proliferation arrest during differentiation of normal and 
pathological hematopoietic progenitors 
6-8 but also prevents 
excess DNA-damage accumulation and exhaustion of cancer 
stem cells. 
39 Thus, consideration should be given to the 
design of antitumor therapies based on miR-26a. </p>

<p>Materials and Methods 
Cell cultures and reagents. HL-60 and U937 cell lines were maintained in 
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1 Ã penicillin/streptomycin solution, 1 Ã 
L-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. VitD3 and Dox were purchased from 
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and utilized at a concentration of 250 and 
200 ng/ml, respectively, unless differently specified. 
Mononuclear cells (MCs) were isolated from the peripheral blood (PB) of 
informed healthy donors as reported.

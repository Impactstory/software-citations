<p>Results 
Acute pRb loss in the absence of p107 leads to spontaneous tumors 
development. Compared with control or p107 
2/2 mice (Supp Fig. 
S1a), the inducible loss of pRb in adult mice epidermis by tamoxi-
fen treatment (Rb 
F/F ;K14creER 
TM mice) produces skin hyperplasia 
(Supp. Fig. S1b), characterized by expansion of basal keratin 5 
(K5)-positive keratinocytes (Supp. Fig. S1e), interfollicular induc-
tion of K6 (Supp. Fig. S1h) and increased proliferation (Supp Fig. 
S1k, m, n), which is undistinguishable from that observed in mice 
bearing constitutive pRb loss in epidermis (Rb </p>

<p>F/F </p>

<p>;K14cre mice) </p>

<p>6 </p>

<p>. 
However, it is insufficient to allow spontaneous tumor develop-
ment over one year and half after pRb loss (n525) (Fig. 1n). On 
the contrary, p107 loss has no phenotypic consequences in epidermis 
(Fig. 1a; Supp. Fig. S1a) </p>

2/2 keratino-

cases corresponded to increased expression of the corresponding 
posttranscriptional effectors Tip60, SetD8 and Smyd2, without sig-
nificant variations in others such as Sirt1, Pcaf and CBP (Fig. 2a). In 
spite of the increased levels of p53 and its active forms, luciferase 
experiments revealed that the p53-depending response was not 
induced in these double deficient cells (Fig. 2b), but rather decreased 
when compared to Rb

luciferase experiments using Pten gene promoter (Fig. 2e), but not 
due to promoter methylation dependent events (Supp Fig. S4). The 
reduction of Pten levels was in parallel with the increased c-jun 
expression, which represses Pten gene expression independently of 
p53 </p>

<p>, and a concomitant increased phosphorylation of Akt at 
Thr308 and Ser473 (Fig. 2a). Of note, DNp63, which is also specif-

In contrast, underexpressed genes were involved in muscle devel-
opment, which may be explained by the partial absence of dermal 
muscle layers in tumor samples, signaling, negative regulation of 
transcription and in cell adhesion (Fig. 4b), which is broadly asso-
ciated with carcinogenesis processes. 
To explore whether the mouse tumors resemble human squamous 
cell carcinoma samples, an exhaustive comparison of the mouse 
tumor 2256-gene signature with gene datasets of human SCC cancer 
samples arising in different organs (skin, head and neck, lung or

novel similarities between overexpressed and underexpressed genes 
in mouse tumors and specific signal transduction pathways, and 
human tumors (Table I). 
One of the studies observed in our GSEA analysis indicated the 
similarity between overexpressed genes in mouse tumors and human 
head and neck tumors associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) 
infection 
27 (24 out of 59 genes in the signature, FDR q value5 
0.000033). The HPV are present in human carcinomas of the cervix 
and head and neck with a prevalence of 90% and 30%, respectively.

To further substantiate the above commented observations, we 
performed a chemopreventive study. Mice were treated with tamox-

was administered (10 mg/kg, thrice/week). After two months, we 
observed that Rapamicyn treatment produced an evident alleviation 
of the phenotype in snout, lips and eyelids (Fig. 6a-b'). Further, the 
histology study of these areas in the mouse cohorts (rapamycin treated 
n58, untreated n511) showed a reduced incidence of tumor develop-
ment in all the cases (Fig. 6c). As expected, rapamycin-treated mice </p>

phorylation (Fig. 6e, e', f). Of note, in spite of the reduction in the 
tumor susceptibility, the overall frail appearance and alopecia were not 
affected by the preventive rapamycin treatment (data not shown). 
Similarly, rapamycin-treated mice displayed evident signs of hyper-
plasia and hyperkeratosis (Fig. 6g', h') compared to control mice 
(rapamycin-treated, tamoxifen-untreated; Fig. 6g, h), and no signifi-
cant reduction in epithelial proliferation compared with untreated 
mice (Fig. 6i, i', j). These results indicate that not all the physiological 
consequences of pRb and p107 loss in epithelia are attributable to the 
increased Akt/mTOR axis. However, mTOR inhibition significantly 
prevents tumor development. </p>

<p>Discussion 
The Rb1 gene product is functionally inactivated in most human 
tumors </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>. However, Rb1 gene mutations are only found in small sub-
sets of human tumors. This indicates that, as the functional inactiva-
tion of pRb probably also affects the other Rb family members p107 
and p130, the specific inactivation of Rb1 gene is only able to induce 
tumorigenesis in restricted tissues </p>

<p>35,36 </p>

<p>. In epidermis, although Rb1 
loss promotes alterations in proliferation and differentiation, indi-
cating the existence of unique functions for this protein in this tissue, 
it is insufficient to allow tumor development </p>

<p>6 </p>

<p>. Overlapping func-
tions between pRb and p107 in epidermis have been previously </p>

<p>demonstrated in epidermis 
6 . Interestingly, although there are dra-
matic changes in gene expression, the phenotype of Rb 
F/F ;K14cre is 
not aggravated by p130 loss </p>

<p>14 </p>

<p>. These overlapping functions between 
pRb and p107 have been also described in other tissues </p>

<p>37,38 </p>

<p>, but are 
particularly highlighted in stratified epithelia where the complete loss 
of pRb and p107 led to death by pnd 10 </p>

<p>6 </p>

<p>. Moreover, double deficient 
epidermis leads to spontaneous tumor development in transplanted 
new born skin, indicating putative tumor suppressor functions of 
p107 in the absence of pRb </p>

<p>13 </p>

<p>. Accordingly, double deficient kerati-
nocytes are highly susceptible to Ha-ras transformation and resistant 
to oncogene-induced premature senescence </p>

<p>13 </p>

<p>. Here, using an indu-
cible mouse model for pRb loss in stratified epithelia to overcome the 
early lethality, we confirm such tumor suppressor functions of p107. 
Previous microarray data using newborn epidermis samples, also 
revealed that the absence of pRb and p107 promoted overexpression 
of multiple E2F-dependent genes </p>

<p>13 </p>

<p>. In contrast, in spite of p53 induc-
tion, multiple p53-dependent genes, predominantly associated to 
apoptosis induction, were actually downregulated 
13 . Our present 
data also reinforce these findings, as we observe that the DNA 
damage-induced p53-activated genes are underexpressed in the

<p>. In addi-

<p>32 </p>

<p>, we may also suggest that somatic deletion of pRb and p107 
efficiently affect direct binding of p53 to the promoter regions of 
activated genes rather than distal enhancer binding. However, when 
we monitored possible defective signaling that may account for the 
decreased transcriptional activity of p53 observed over apoptotic

<p>;K14cre;

2/2 skin, we found Pten gene. The expression of this gene is 
modulated by various transcription factors including p53, which 
enhances Pten transcription </p>

<p>17 </p>

<p>. Our data showing decreased p53 tran-
scriptional activity and reduced Pten expression might support this 
observation. The specific upregulation of DNp63 and c-jun in double 
deficient keratinocytes can also contribute to the Pten gene down-
regulation, as these two transcription factors have been recently 
involved in Pten gene repression </p>

<p>25,26 </p>

<p>. Nonetheless, the molecular </p>

<p>mechanisms by which pRb and p107 loss lead to such increased 
expression of p63 and and c-jun is presently unknown. 
The finding of tumor development specifically in the oral area 
concurs with the observed reduced expression of Pten. The express-
ion of a constitutive active Akt in stratified epithelia of transgenic 
mice led to preneoplasic lesions in the oral cavity and perioral 
regions </p>

<p>22,42 </p>

<p>. Importantly, these lesions did not progress to overt 
squamous tumors due to the induction of premature senescence, 
which is overcome by specific ablation of p53, but not pRb </p>

<p>42 </p>

<p>. 
Comparable incidence of tumors showing similar characteristics 
was found in mice bearing the specific elimination of Pten and p53 
genes in stratified epithelia </p>

<p>42 </p>

<p>. The present data are in agreement and 
also reinforce these observations, as the absence of p107 can bypass 
the oncogene-induced senescence in pRb-deficient keratinocytes </p>

<p>13 </p>

<p>. 
Our data are also in agreement with the recent report showing that 
the loss of pRb and p107 can predispose to oral tumors in mice </p>

<p>43 </p>

<p>, 
although the authors do not report any spontaneous tumor develop-
ment </p>

<p>. This might be due to different experimental procedures and/ 
or to the different genetic background of the transgenic mice </p>

ples provide information about genes that could display impor-

and non-essential roles in the normal tissue. The therapeutic inhibi-
tion of these genes would not affect normal tissue homeostasis but 
may affect tumor growth or invasive properties, thus becoming 
potential molecular targets for therapy. In addition, interspecies

mine which genes display similar expression patterns so they can be

2/2 mice could represent a 
possible model for human squamous malignancies. This is of a par-
ticular relevance in the case of human cancers bearing HPV infec-
tion, which display a very significant gene expression overlap with 
mouse tumors. This observation, which is in agreement with the 
reported role of HPV E7 oncogene mediating the degradation of 
the retinoblastoma family members </p>

<p>28-30 </p>

<p>, also reinforces the proposed 
role of HPV E7 oncogene in the genesis of this type of tumors </p>

<p>43 </p>

<p>. Also 
in line with our observations, it has been reported that the expression 
of E7 oncogene is able to induce Akt activity in vitro in a manner 
dependent on pRb binding and inactivation, and similar increase was 
also reported in HPV-positive cervical high-grade squamous intrae-

The HNSCC represents the sixth most common human cancer

<p>. Despite 
progress in surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, the 5-year survival 
rate for oral cancer has not improved significantly over the past 
decades and remains at about 50-55% 
46 . Numerous new targeted 
therapies have been proposed for this disease, in particular affecting 
Akt pathway (discussed in </p>

<p>47 </p>

<p>). Our present data showing that rapa-
mycin treatment significantly prevent the tumor development also 
reinforce these hypotheses and are in agreement with previous stud-
ies indicating that mTOR inhibition could be beneficial for the treat-
ment of this type of cancer </p>

<p>48-51 </p>

<p>. Also in agreement, we observed that 
the deregulated genes in mouse tumors are differentially expressed in 
cell lines sensitive to Akt or mTOR inhibition. 
Collectively, our present data revealed a novel, previously unre-
ported, functional connection between the three major tumor sup-
pressor genes p53, Pten and pRb. Our results also highlight the 
relevance of these tumor suppressors in specific human malignancies 
and open new possible therapeutic avenues for the treatment of these 
diseases, and in particular those associated with HPV infection. </p>

backskin of the animals (2x2 cm) at 20 mg/per day dissolved in DMSO/acetone for 5 
consecutive days. Primary keratinocytes were cultured as described </p>

<p>6 </p>

<p>. 1 mM 4-
hydroxitamoxifen (4OHTX) diluted in ethanol was added to primary keratinocytes 
for 72 hours in the culture medium. Rapamycin (LC Laboratories, R-5000) treatment 
was intraperitoneally administered three days per week for two months (10 mg/Kg) 
to mice treated previously with tamoxifen. Newborn skin transplants were performed 
as previously reported 
8 . </p>

<p>Immunohistochemical methods. Immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence 
analyses were performed in formalin or ethanol fixed paraffin embedded samples as 
previously reported 
8,22 . Antibodies used were anti K5, anti K6 (Covance), anti K10 
(Dako), mouse monoclonal anti K15 (Neomarkers), anti Pten (Sta Cruz Biotech.), 
anti laminin (Sigma), anti Akt phospho-Ser473 (IHC Specific) and anti phospho-
Ser235/236 S6 ribosomal protein (Cell Signaling). Fluorochrome or Biotin-
conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. 
For immunohistochemistry, signal was amplified using avidin-peroxidase (ABC elite 
kit Vector) and peroxidase was visualized using diaminobenzidine as a substrate 
(DAB kit Vector). Control slides were obtained by replacing primary antibodies with 
PBS (data not shown). Mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with 
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; 0.1 mg/g weight in 0.9% NaCl; Roche) 1 hour before 
sacrifice. BrdUrd incorporation was monitored by immunofluorescence in ethanol-
fixed or in formalin-fixed sections using an anti BrdU antibody (Roche) as 
described </p>

<p>Western blot. Western blot was performed as described previously 
6,8,22 . Secondary 
antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Super Signal West Pico 
Chemiluminscence Substrate (Pierce) was used according to the manufacturer's 
recommendations to visualize the bands. Antibodies used are anti pRb (Pharmigen), 
anti p107, anti p130, anti Pten, anti p63, anti CBP, anti c-jun, anti Akt (Sta. Cruz 
Biotechnology), anti Tip60, anti Pcaf, anti p21, anti p73, anti phospho-Ser392 p53, 
methyl K372 p53, acetyl K3731K382 p53, anti SetD8, anti smyd2 (AbCam), anti Sirt1 
(Sigma), anti DNp73 (Imgenex), anti Akt phosho S473 and phospho T308, anti 
phospho-Ser235/236 S6 ribosomal protein (Cell Signaling) and anti p53 
(Novocastra). Loading was controlled by using an anti Actin antibody (Sta.Cruz 
Biotechnology). 
The panel of phosphorylation profiles of kinases were analyzed following manu-
facter recomendations (Human Phospho-Kinase Array, ARY003, R&amp;D Systems, 
Minneapolis, MN). Membranes were incubated with 500 mg of protein extract from 
skin and tumor samples. This array screens for relative levels of phosphorylation of 39 
proteins. Quantification of the relative expression of specific phosphorylated protein 
was determined by <rs id="software-8" type="software">QuantityOne</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-8" type="creator">BioRad</rs>). </p>

<p>Methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Genomic DNA samples (1 mg) were modified by 
sodium bisulphite using the CpGenome DNA modification kit (Intergen) following 
the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA methylation status of the promoter region 
of Pten and cdkn1a genes was analyzed by methylation specific PCR (MSP) after 
sodium bisulphite modification of DNA. Mouse genomic DNA universally 
methylated for all genes (Zymo Research) was used as a positive control for 
methylated alleles. Water blanks were included with each assay. Following 
amplification, PCR products were subjected to gel electrophoresis through a 2.5% 
agarose gel and were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and UV transil-
lumination. For Pten-MSP, Pten-MD (59-TTTTCGGAGTATCGATTAAGGC-39) 
and Pten-MR (59-GAAAAAAACAAAAACGAAAAACG-39) primers were used in 
the methylated reactions, which amplify a 205bp product. For cdkn1a-MSP, cdkn1a-
MD (59-GTTAGCGAGTTTTCGGGATC-39) and cdkn1a-MR (59-
CTCGACTACTACAATTAACGTCGAA-39) primers were used for the methylated 
reaction, which amplify a 111bp product. The cdkn1a-UD (59-
GGTTAGTGAGTTTTTGGGATTG-39) and cdkn1a-UR (59-
TCAACTACTACAATTAACATCAAA-39) primers were used for the unmethylated 
reaction, which amplify a 111bp product. </p>

<p>. Hybridization was done to Affymetrix Mouse GE MOE430 
2.0 array. Raw and processed data were deposited in the GEO database with the 
accession identifier GSE38257. Supervised analysis of differential expression between 
tumors and normal tissue was done using <rs type="software">SAM test</rs> 
53 available in the open source 
software <rs type="software">Multiexperiment Viewer (MeV</rs>) </p>

<p>54 </p>

<p>, using 200 random permutations. For 
further analyses, a number of 1128 probesets (representing 2.5% of the array) were 
selected by fold change as overexpressed in the carcinomas or underexpressed (giving 
rise to 2256 deregulated probesets). Using this approach, all selected probesets display 
highly significant q-values (q-val50) and fold change values from 4.38 to 4.16 (for 
overexpressed) or from 24.38 to 24.10 (for underexpressed). MOE430 2.0 
Affymetrix chip probeset IDs were mapped to human using Ailun web utility </p>

<p>55 </p>

<p>. 
Enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) terms was done upon uploading 
selected probesets identifiers into <rs type="software">DAVID Functional Annotation web tool</rs>, which

with other gene signatures. In Table 1, we analyze the enrichment with a collection of 
2392 different gene sets (available at http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/ 
collections.jsp) that represents gene expression signatures of genetic and chemical 
perturbations (subgroup c2.cgp). A selection of some relevant and highly statistically 
significant enriched gene sets was done. We permutated the gene set for 1000 times 
rather than permutating the phenotype because the sample number is small. In Table 
2, we analyze the enrichment of p53-activated and p53-repressed DNA damage 
response genes in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells within the mouse tumors when 
compared to normal skin. Gene sets were downloaded from </p>

<p>. Association of the mapped signatures 
with the database signatures was tested using Fisher's exact test, and was considered 
significant for Odds Ratio.1.5, and p-val,0.006. Genes overexpressed or 
underexpressed in the mouse carcinomas were mapped to human gene symbols and 
loaded into the Oncomine database. We have searched for overlaps using different 
filtering criteria, based on the type of human cancer comparison performed. These 
criteria were: i) ''Cancer vs. Normal'', to search for similarities with human squamous 
cell carcinomas of different tissue of origin; ii) ''Drug sensitivity'', to search for 
similarities with human cancer cell lines with differential sensitivities to specific </p>

infected tumors. </p>

<p>RT-PCR. For the qPCR analyses, total RNA was isolated from mice skins using 
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacture's instructions. Genomic 
DNA was eliminated from the samples by a DNase treatment (Rnase-Free Dnase Set 
Qiagen). RNA from each sample (800 ng) was reverse transcribed in a final volume of 
40 ml using the Omniscript RT Kit (Qiagen) and an oligo (dT) 18 primer. Real time 
PCR was performed in a 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) with 
10 ml reactions containing 5 ml of Power SYBR GREEN PCR master mix (Applied 
Biosystems), 3 ml or RNase free water, 0.5 ml of each primer (500 nM), and 1 ml of 
cDNA as PCR template. Cycling parameters were 50uC for 2 minutes, 95uC for 
10 min to activate DNA polymerase followed by 40 cycles of 95uC for 15 s, and 60uC 
for 1 min. Detection of fluorescence was carried out at the end of each amplification 
step. Moreover, after each amplification, melting curves were performed to verify 
specificity of the target and absence of primer dimerization. Reaction efficiency was 
calculated for each primer combination and GUS B gene was used as reference gene. 
The sequences of the specific oligonucleotides used are as follows: 
Pten Forward 59… AGG CCA ACC GAT ACT TCT CTC…39 
Pten Reverse 59… CAT CTG GAG TCA CAG AAG TTG AA…39 
GUSB Forward 59… GAGGATCAACAGTGCCCATT…39 
GUSB Reverse 59… CAGCCTCAAAGGGGAGGT…39 </p>

<p>Luciferase assays. Primary keratinocytes were incubated for forty-eight hours with 4-
hydroxytamoxifen to induce pRb deletion. Transient transfections were performed 
with the Superfect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol after 4-
hydroxytamoxifen treatment. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were harvested 
for luciferase assays (Promega Dual-Luciferase Kit). Firefly luciferase values were 
standardized to Renilla luciferase values (pRL-SV40; Promega) to account for 
differences in transfection efficiency between samples. Expression plasmids coding 
for pGL3-p53 responding elements (kindly provided by Dr. I. Palmero, IIB, Spain) 
and pGL3-E2F responding elements (kindly provided by Dra. X Lu, Ludwig Institute, 
London) were used. Pten promoter cloning was performed by PCR amplification of 
21 and 21365 region with specific primers (Forward 
59…GGTGTGTTATCTAGGTAAAGACTGTCGCCG…39 and Reverse 
59…GGCGGTGTCATAATGTCTCTCAGCACATAG…39) using DNA from skin 
mouse as a matrix. Amplified fragment was inserted in HindIII-NheI of pGL3 vector 
(Promega). Cloning fragment was verified by automatic sequencing. </p>

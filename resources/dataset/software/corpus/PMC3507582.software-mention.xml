<p>OBJECTIVEdAn elevated insulin resistance index (homeostasis model assessment of insulin 
resistance [HOMA-IR]) is more commonly seen in the Mexican American population than in 
European populations. We report quantitative ancestral effects within a Mexican American 
population, and we correlate ancestral components with HOMA-IR. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdWe performed ancestral analysis in 1,551 par-
ticipants of the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort by genotyping 103 ancestry-informative 
markers (AIMs). These AIMs allow determination of the percentage (0-100%) ancestry from 
three major continental populations, i.e., European, African, and Amerindian. </p>

<p>RESULTSdWe observed that predominantly Amerindian ancestral components were associated 
with increased HOMA-IR (b = 0.124, P = 1.64 3 10 </p>

<p>27 </p>

<p>). The correlation was more significant in 
males (Amerindian b = 0.165, P = 5.08 3 10 </p>

<p>27 </p>

<p>) than in females (Amerindian b = 0.079, P = 0.019). </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONSdThis unique study design demonstrates how genomic markers for quan-
titative ancestral information can be used in admixed populations to predict phenotypic traits 
such as insulin resistance. </p>

tile of 55.1%; the median African ancestry 
was 11.0%, with 5% percentile of 6.6% 
and 95% percentile of 15.3%; and the me-
dian Amerindian ancestry was 42.9%, 
with 5% percentile of 33.1% and 95% per-
centile of 53.0%. The coefficient of varia-
tion (CV) of European ancestries was 
32.5%, the CV of African ancestries was 
59.5%, and the CV of Amerindian ances-
tries was 37.0%. 
To explain high levels of HOMA-IR in 
this population, we tested the correlation be-
tween ancestral components and HOMA-IR 
levels (Supplementary Table 1). Aging and 
obesity are known risk factors for insulin 
resistance (9). Socioeconomic status has 
also been highlighted as an important fac-
tor for the development of insulin resis-
tance (10). After adjusting for age, BMI, 
household annual income, educational 
levels, and ancestral components, we found 
that the Amerindian ancestral component 
is positively associated with elevated 
HOMA-IR levels (b = 0.124, P = 1.64 3 
10 </p>

<p>27 </p>

<p>), and the European ancestral compo-
nent (also expressed as a percentage) is neg-
atively associated with HOMA-IR levels 
(b = 20.111, P = 3.18 3 10 </p>

<p>26 </p>

<p>). The cor-
relation is more significant in males 
(Amerindian b = 0.165, P = 5.08 3 10 </p>

<p>27 </p>

<p>) </p>

<p>than in females (Amerindian b = 0.079, P = 
0.019). The adjusted sex effect on HOMA-
IR levels has b = 0.062 and P = 5.26 3 10 </p>

<p>23 </p>

<p>. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONSdIn this study, we 
demonstrated that higher HOMA-IR 
levels are correlated with Amerindian an-
cestry in a Mexican American population. 
Amerindian and European populations 
have different susceptibilities to many met-
abolic diseases (2). The considerable vari-
ability of European and Amerindian 
ancestries between Mexican American indi-
viduals that we show in this study suggests 
that individuals may have different genetic 
susceptibility to diseases. The incomplete 
understanding of the genetic susceptibility 
to complex diseases increases the impor-
tance of examining ethnicity information 
to identify people at high risk of a disease. 
We estimated the proportion of an-
cestry from each contributing population 
(European, African, and Amerindian) us-
ing AIMs developed specifically for the 
Mexican American population by Kosoy 
et al. (5). Kosoy et al. have shown that a 
subset of as few as 24 AIMs is sufficient for 
ancestral analysis in Mexican Americans (5). 
Considerable variation of ancestral compo-
nents found in CCHC participants allows us 
to more precisely assess ancestral effects </p>

<p>within one single population with limited 
environmental confounding factors. The 
decreased insulin sensitivity that we have 
shown to be associated with Amerindian 
ancestry may thus contribute substantially 
to high rates of insulin resistance syndrome 
in Mexican Americans (4). We also ob-
served an interesting sex effect from ances-
try in the degree of insulin sensitivity, 
possibly related to the protective effect of 
estrogen in females (11). Compared with 
the Mexican American reference population 
in the HapMap project, the CCHC partici-
pants of our study have similar distributions 
of ancestral components. Therefore, the re-
sults of this study are representative of the 
broader population of Mexican origin. 
A number of genetic variants with 
key roles in insulin sensitivity have been 
identified (12,13), including the glucoki-
nase regulatory protein gene (GCKR) var-
iant rs780094, which tags the strongest 
genetic effect among identified genetic 
loci of insulin sensitivity (13,14). The 
GCKR gene variant partially explains 
lower insulin sensitivity in Amerindians 
(6.14% of the ancestral effect) (H.-Q.Q., 
unpublished data). However, a limitation 
of our current study is the limited number 
of AIMs genotyped. Admixture mapping 
using AIMs at high density in this cohort is 
warranted to further investigate genetic 
variants contributing to the ancestral ef-
fect. Additional study efficiency may be 
acquired by the combined usage of asso-
ciation mapping (15). </p>

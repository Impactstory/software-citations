<p>ABSTRACT </p>

<p>Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the trabecular bone changes after alveolar bone grafting in unilateral cleft lip 
and palate (UCLP) patients using a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. 
Materials and Methods: The occlusal radiographs taken from 50 UCLP patients were surveyed retrospectively. The 
images were categorized as: 50 images in group 0 (before bone grafting), 33 images in group 1 (one month after bone 
grafting), 24 images in group 2 (2-4 months after bone grafting), 15 images in group 3 (5-7 months after bone grafting), 
and 21 images in group 4 (8 or more months after bone grafting). Each image was grouped as either "non-cleft side" 
or "cleft side". The CAD system was used five times for each side to calculate the pixel area based on the mathematical 
morphology. Significant differences were found using a Wilcoxon signed ranks test or paired samples t test. 
Results: The pixel area showed a significant difference between the "non-cleft side" and "cleft side" in group 0 
(404.27±103.72/117.73±92.25; p= =0.00), group 1 (434.29±86.70/388.31±109.51; p= =0.01), and group 4 (430.98 
±98.11/366.71±154.59; p= =0.02). No significant differences were found in group 2 (423.57±98.12/383.47± 
135.88; p= =0.06) or group 3 (433.02±116.07/384.16±146.55; p= =0.19). 
Conclusion: Based on the design of this study, alveolar bone grafting was similar to normal bone within 2-7 months 
postoperatively. (Imaging Sci Dent 2012; 42 : 225-9) </p>

<p>bone analysis using a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)

The purpose of this study was to use a CAD system on 
digital images as a tool to quantitatively measure the pixel 
area of trabecular bone changes after alveolar bone grafting 
in unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) patients. </p>

<p>Materials and Methods </p>

<p>The occlusal radiographs taken from 70 UCLP patients 
at the Radiologic Clinic, Faculty of Dentistry, Khon Kaen </p>

<p>University from 1999 to 2010 were surveyed retrospec-
tively. The exclusion criteria for the radiographs were 
images that had poor diagnostic quality including scratches 
on the radiograph or too much distortion, and patients who 
did not undergo follow-up. Therefore, 20 patients' data 
were excluded and 50 UCLP patients' images were included 
in this study. The images were classified as follows: group 
0: before bone grafting, 50 images, group 1: one month 
after bone grafting, 33 images, group 2: 2-4 months after 
bone grafting, 24 images, group 3: 5-7 months after bone 
grafting, 15 images, and group 4: 8 or more months after </p>

<p>bone grafting, 21 images. The 50 patients included 20 
males and 30 females. Patient age at the time of the alve-
olar bone grafting ranged from 8 to 29 years (mean; 12.3 
±4.6). There were 16 sites of right UCLP and 34 sites of 
left UCLP. All of the images were digitized on a flatbed 
image scanner with a resolution of 600 dots per inch (dpi) 
spatial resolution and 8-bit depth contrast resolution (256 
gray levels) (Epson expression 10000XL, Long Beach, 
CA, USA). 
The CAD system 
11 was used to select two regions of </p>

<p>interest (ROIs), the 'non-cleft side' and 'cleft side'. The 
CAD algorithm was implemented by a technical comput-</p>

<p>ing language (<rs id="software-0" type="software">MATLAB</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">R2010a</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">MathWorks Inc</rs>., Natick, 
MA, USA). The ROI, a square portion of 64×64 pixels, 
was extracted by dragging the mouse from a randomly 
selected single point to 64 pixels left and 64 pixels down-
ward. The tooth structure, periodontal ligament, and lamina 
dura were excluded from each ROI. Next, the noise was 
removed by median filtering. Morphological skeletoniza-
tion was then used to extract the medial axis of the trabe-
cular bone, which was regarded as the prominent region 
that was brighter than the surrounding structures, and sub-
sequently, the images were enlarged 64-fold. The 'strel' 
function was selected from the computing language to </p>

<p>create a flat, rectangle-shaped structuring element (strel 
('rectangle',[2 3])) where [2 3] is the size. In the matrix 
[2 3], the first element was the number of rows in the str-
ucturing element neighbourhood; the second element was 
the number of columns. Then, the most basic morpholog-
ical operations, which were 'erosion' and 'dilation,' were 
performed. The 'erosion' function removed pixels on the 
object boundaries, while dilation added pixels to the bound-
aries of objects in an image. The number of pixels added 
or removed from the objects in an image depends on the 
size and the shape of the structuring element used to pro-
cess the image. Finally, the pixel area calculation was used 
to estimate the area of the trabecular bone in the binary 
image, that is, the digital image that had only two possible 
values for each pixel, namely 0 and 1 (Figs. 1 and 2). The 
pixel area of the "non-cleft side" and "cleft side" from 
group 0 to group 4 were calculated and compared. The 
measurements were made five times, once a week, on each 
side by an oral radiologist. Five positions were randomly 
selected at the "non-cleft side" and "cleft side" on the same 
image. All of the pixel areas of the image were then cal-
culated. Statistical tests were performed using <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">10.1</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">SPSS Inc</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics were 
applied. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to evaluate a nor-
mally distributed pixel area. Wilcoxon signed ranks test 
was used when the data did not show normal distribution 
and the paired samples t test was used when the data show-
ed normal distribution. The study design was approved by 
the Khon Kaen University Ethics Committee for Human 
Research. </p>

<p>significant differences found in group 2 (423.57±98.12/

384.16±146.55; p= =0.192) (Table 1). </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>Alveolar bone grafting in patients with cleft lip and pal-
ate is now a common practice owing to several advantages. 
It can help to prevent the collapse and constriction of the 
dental arch, to close the oronasal fistula, and to allow erup-
tion of teeth into the cleft. The bone grafting is fully revas-
cularized between 14 and 21 days, and new bone is form-
ed in approximately six weeks and has matured after six 
months. 
12 It is generally thought that osseous healing of </p>

<p>transplants is completed six months after the operation. 
Nightingale et al compared three methods of radiographic 
assessment, the Bergland, Kindelan, and Chelsea scales, 
which produced great reproducibility rather than validity. </p>

<p>9 </p>

<p>Over-and under-estimation of the success rate of the alve-
olar bone grafting has also been reported in some cases. </p>

<p>13   The CAD system, therefore, has been developed to deter-
mine the bone quantity in the alveolar cleft after bone 
grafting. This CAD system uses mathematical morpholo-
gy and calculates the area on the binary images that can 
be produced by <rs type="software">MathWorks</rs>. Our results showed that the 
pixel areas from the binary images in the "cleft side" were 
significantly smaller than those on the "non-cleft side" in 
group 0 (before bone grafting) and group 1 (one month 
after bone grafting). This means that the trabecular bone 
increased but was still less than the normal side. In addi-
tion, there was no significant difference found in group 2 
(2-4 months after bone grafting) and group 3 (5-7 months 
after bone grafting), which means the trabecular bone grad-
ually increased in the 2-4 months and was similar to the 
normal bone within 5-7 months. It should be noted that the 
new bone formation with osteoid deposition indicated 
remodeling of 25-55% at 3 months postoperatively and 
the grafted bone had a denser structure than the control </p>

14 The histomophometric </p>

<p>analysis has shown that major bone remodeling can already 
be seen after 4-5 months. 
15 However, the pixel area pre-</p>

<p>sented a significant difference again in group 4 (8 or more 
months after bone grafting), which means the quantity of 
bone had decreased after eight months. Honma et al also 
reported that the grafted bone volumes one year after alveo-
lar bone grafting were significantly reduced compared 
with 3 months after grafting using CT. 
16 Therefore, long-</p>

<p>term follow-up is suggested to evaluate the trabecular bone 
at the bone grafting area in comparison to the side with 
normal bone. Dental radiographs may be used with the 
CAD system to evaluate the bone grafting area more easily 
than CT images and show cost-effectiveness. 
The CAD system was developed based on mathematical 
morphology using <rs type="software">MathWorks</rs>. The ROI can be controlled 
by using the same size and can be changed into binary 
images for calculating the pixel area that corresponds to 
the total number of pixels in the image. The CAD system 
could be useful for evaluating grafting failure, which 
would permit re-grafting before the eruption of the teeth 
and improve the prognosis of cleft lip and palate patients. 
Trindade et al 
8 and Jia et al 
17 showed 86% and 88% success </p>

<p>rates, respectively, for the long term outcome of alveolar 
bone grafting in a UCLP group using the Bergland scale. 
However, their studies did not evaluate the success rate. 
A further prospective study would be required using this 
CAD system to support surgeons to determine the appro-
priate period for re-grafting or to explain the success of 
bone grafting compared with normal bone on the same 
image. The quantity of the pixel area might be useful for 
further and better treatment planning for artificial eruption 
in the cleft area. 
In conclusion, based on the design of this study, alveolar 
bone grafting was similar to normal bone within 2-7 months 
postoperatively and our results suggest that the CAD sys-
tem might be used to calculate the bone grafting quantity 
in UCLP patients. </p>

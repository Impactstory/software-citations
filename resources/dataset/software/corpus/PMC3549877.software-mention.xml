<p>Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome (HGP; OMIM:176670) 
and Werner Syndrome (WS; OMIM:277700) are two distinct 
premature aging diseases defined by aging related phenotypes 
occurring early in life. 
1 As naturally aged individuals, HGP and 
WS patients present hair graying, skin thinning, atherosclerosis 
and osteopenia, but also show unique features such as subcutane-
ous tissue loss or laryngeal atrophy (high voice). Genetically, the 
disease could be traced back to mutations in lamin A (LMNA) </p>

<p>2,3   and the Werner syndrome RecQ helicase like (WRN) 
4 genes. 
However, the downstream causal events still remain elusive. In 
addition, a number of patients presenting a HGP or WS pheno-
type do not present any known genetic aberrations. 
Herein, epigenetics could provide additional information by 
adding a level of gene regulation independent from genetic alter-
ations. Epigenetics, understood in general terms as the inheri-
tance of genome activity that does not depend on the strict DNA 
sequence, is known to be dynamic and to adapt to the surround-
ing circumstances. 
5 In addition, epigenetics provides an explana-
tion for the phenotypic differences of genetically identical beings, 
such as the examples of monozygotic twins, 
6,7 cloned animals 
8 or 
the Agouti mice. 
9,10 To address the issue of whether epigenetic 
variants can be associated with the disease phenotypes of pre-
mature aged patients, we analyzed the DNA methylation (the 
most recognized and studied epigenetic mark) profiles of HGP </p>

<p>DNa methylation gradiently changes with age and is likely to be involved in aging-related processes with subsequent 
phenotype changes and increased susceptibility to certain diseases. The hutchinson-Gilford progeria (hGp) and Werner 
syndrome (Ws) are two premature aging diseases showing features of common natural aging early in life. Mutations in 
the LMNA and WRN genes were associated to disease onset; however, for a subset of patients the underlying causative 
mechanisms remain elusive. We aimed to evaluate the role of epigenetic alteration on premature aging diseases by 
performing comprehensive DNa methylation profiling of hGp and Ws patients. We observed profound changes in the 
DNa methylation landscapes of WRN and LMNA mutant patients, which were narrowed down to a set of aging related 
genes and processes. although of low overall variance, non-mutant patients revealed differential DNa methylation at 
distinct loci. hence, we propose DNa methylation to have an impact on premature aging diseases. </p>

<p>Results and Discussion </p>

<p>We performed the Infinium DNA methylation BeadChip 
platform (Illumina), analyzing more than 450,000 CpG sites 
genome-wide. DNA was extracted from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) 
immortalized B-cells (lymphoblastoid cell lines; LCLs) obtained 
from two WRN (AG07896, AG11385) and one LMNA (AG19911) 
mutant WS patient (Table 1). 
11 In addition, we analyzed one 
non-mutant WS patient (AG03364) and three non-mutant HGP 
patients. It is of note that the non-mutant HGP samples consist 
of direct relatives, represented by a father (AG15693) and its two 
daughters (AG15694, AG15695). The DNA methylation data are 
freely available at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data-
base: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=xlcjfiewe 
oacwna&amp;acc=GSE42865. 
Noticing an effect of the EBV immortalization on the epig-
enome of the analyzed control LCL samples, as illustrated by 
absolute DNA methylation levels of naive CD19 
+ B-cells and a 
LCL, Fig. 1A, we initially filtered for CpG sites without vari-
ability between healthy LCLs (n = 3) and healthy naive B-cells 
(n = 3) (δ average β-value &lt; 0.05). To further exclude an impact 
of blood cell composition of the analyzed LCL samples, especially </p>

HGP phenotype, the father was 28 y older at sample acquisition. 
Differentially methylated sites in mutant patients. In order 
to extract particular disease-related differences between controls 
and samples obtained from premature aging patients, we deter-
mined differentially methylated CpG sites (dmCpGs) between 
the controls (n = 3) and diseased samples (δ average β-value &gt; 
0.2). 
Initially, we were interested in epigenetic alteration associ-
ated to the disease-related gene mutations of LMNA or WRN. 
As mutations in LMNA are causing both HGP and WS, whereas 
WRN mutations are exclusively related to the latter, we ana-
lyzed both mutations separately. We observed that the mutant 
samples presented a number of overlapping alterations; how-
ever, there was a high proportion of sample-specific alteration 
(Fig. 2C-E) and inter-sample variation (Fig. 2B). Using the 
aforementioned selection criteria, we determined 3,544 consis-
tent differentially methylated CpG sites associated to mutation in 
the WRN gene (13,501 for AG11385 and 17,506 for AG07896). 
Although affected by the same genetic defect the WRN mutant 
samples revealed a high variability, which might be explained 
by the nature of the genetic defect. The Werner syndrome RecQ 
helicase gene is involved in DNA replication, recombination and 
DNA repair (3' to 5' exonuclease activity). Impaired function of 
WRN eventually results in double strand breaks and accumula-
tion of mutations. The here observed epimutations could be a 
direct consequence of mutant CpG sites or CpG methylation-
associated sequences in their proximity (methylation quantita-
tive trait loci 
13 ). Considering the stochastic distribution of such 
events, which is supported by the equal genome-wide distribu-
tion (Fig. 2A), we expected a few driver events masked by a mass 
of passenger events on genetic and epigenetic level. To address </p>

<p>important when comparing LCLs and peripheral blood mono-
nuclear cells (PBMC) data from a previous aging study, 
12 we 
additionally excluded CpG sites revealing variability between 
naive B-cells (n = 3) and samples obtained from PBMC (n = 3; 
δ average β-value &lt; 0.05). After further exclusion of CpG sites 
on gender chromosomes and those containing single nucleotide 
polymorphisms in their detection probe or interrogated CpG site 
(Caucasian population, 1000 Genome Project, &gt; 1% frequency) 
and poor detection quality (detection p value &gt; 0.01), we analyzed 
272,290 CpG sites in the here presented study. Following filter-
ing for probes detecting here unmodelled sources, we observed 
a very high correlation (R 
2 &gt; 0.99) among all analyzed healthy 
control samples, as exemplary illustrated in Figure 1B. 
Mutant patients exhibit global DNA methylation differ-
ences. Genome-wide DNA methylation variation (Fig. 2A) and 
unsupervised clustering analysis (Fig. 2B) of the DNA methyla-
tion profiles of HGP and WS patient DNA revealed profound 
differences between mutant and non-mutant samples. The WRN 
and LMNA mutant samples clearly clustered separately from the 
controls, suggesting mutation-specific DNA methylation profiles 
with possible causality on disease onset. Single samples compari-
sons revealed globally similar DNA methylation profiles with a 
fraction of CpG sites gaining methylation (in a healthy unmeth-
ylated context) and loosing methylation in previous hypermeth-
ylated regions (Fig. 2C-E). Importantly, we noticed an overlap 
of differentially methylated CpG sites. However, each sample 
revealed additional unique alterations (Fig. 2C-E). 
The non-mutant WS and HGP samples presented DNA 
methylation profiles that were poorly distinguishable between 
healthy and diseased samples (Fig. 2A and B). Interestingly, the 
non-mutant sample of the father (AG15693) revealed an increase 
of variability compared with the two daughters (AG15694, </p>

<p>Epigenetics

<p>the mutation driven phenotypes, Fig. 3B), we suggest the differ-
ential promoter hypomethylation to be a common downstream 
event with crucial function in disease onset. We further propose 
the inappropriate promoter hypomethylation of LOC149837 and 
subsequent piRNA activation as causative epigenetic event for the 
development of HGP and WS. 
In order to determine yet unidentified disease-related genetic 
alteration in addition to the previously identified (WRN and 
LMNA), we screened differentially methylated gene promoters of 
the non-mutated samples for common regulatory mechanisms. 
Here, the 25 transcripts associated to disease-specific CpG sites 
were enriched for transcription factor binding sites for MYB 
(z-test; TRANSFAC: FDR &lt; 0.05), a transcription factor associ-
ated to aging, 
15 including the response to oxidative stress of aged 
cells. 
16 It is of note that the DNA polymerase POLD3 is among 
the MYB targets, whose deregulation, due to its DNA repair 
activity, might have a direct impact on the disease phenotypes 
as it was observed for the DNA repair gene WRN (Fig. 3C). The 
significant enrichment of MYB binding sites in differentially 
methylated gene promoters led us to hypothesize if the transcrip-
tion factor itself is targeted by genetic alterations, eventually gene 
mutation, causing the HGP phenotype. Although speculative at </p>

<p>this critical point, we assumed that, due to the phenotype simi-
larities to normal aging, the disease causing driver events were 
also detectable in natural aged samples. Consequently, we inte-
grated DNA methylation data obtained from a set of newborn 
and centenarian samples previously analyzed in our laboratory 
for aging specific changes. 
12 Here, 144 CpG showed differential 
methylation in the natural aged and in the WRN mutant sample 
sets and thus represent potential driver candidates for the pre-
mature aging phenotype of the WS patients (Table S1). These 
sites include gene promoters involved and significantly enriched 
in I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling (CASP8, IL1RL1 and 
LGALS1) and the proteinaceous extracellular matrix formation 
(ADAMTS4, LGALS1, PODNL1 and ZP3) (Fisher's exact test: 
p &lt; 0.01). All of these candidates are likely to be involved in phe-
notypic changes observed during aging. 
While patients with WRN mutation have to cope with an 
accumulation of DNA damage, LMNA mutant cells are asso-
ciated to severe structural alterations in the nucleus, leading to 
chromatin reorganization and subsequent epigenetic alterations. 
Therefore, most of the detected variation in DNA methylation 
will be passenger events, not directly related to disease onset. 
Consequently, we applied the aforementioned selection criteria 
and comparisons to define dmCpGs for the WS patient harbor-
ing a LMNA mutation. Here, we identified 18,480 dmCpGs, of 
which 485 also revealed differential methylation in the natural 
aging data set (Table S2). Interestingly, the NF-kappaB nucleus 
import mechanism was a significantly enriched ontology term 
among the differentially methylated genes (Fisher's exact test: 
p &lt; 0.01; PRKCG, NLRP12), suggesting this inflammation-
related process plays a crucial role in the aging process of healthy 
and diseased individuals. 
Non-mutant patients revealed consistent changes in DNA 
methylation. Analyzing non-mutant premature aging samples, 
we took advantage of the unique properties of the three HGP 
family members. Assuming a similar genetic background of the 
samples, we aimed to extract common dmCpGs and suggested 
those to present a particular association to the premature aging 
disease. Here, we observed 78 sites with consistent changes in 
DNA methylation (Table S3). Most strikingly, the promoter 
of the non-coding RNA LOC149837 harbored four dmCpGs 
in the close proximity of the transcription start site (-51 bp), 
forming a differential methylated region with high potential as 
an important factor for gene regulation (Fig. 3A). LOC149837, 
also annotated as LINC00654, is defined as long intergenic non-
protein coding RNA (lincRNA) with to date unknown biologi-
cal function. Interestingly, the transcript is located in a cluster 
of PIWI-associated RNAs (piRNAs) (piRNA bank ID: 103; 
chr20:5461000-5500000), suggesting the region is a so far poorly 
recognized piRNA host transcript with association to premature 
aging. The approximately 30 nt-sized small RNAs participate 
in germline-specific regulatory processes, including silencing of 
transposable elements by direct interaction or epigenetic repres-
sion. 
14 As a subset of piRNAs, including the here identified, do 
not overlap transposable sequences, an additional function of the 
small RNAs is suspected. As the epimutation of LOC149837 is 
present in all seven analyzed premature aged samples (including </p>

<p>this stage, these results might inspire further studies involving 
targeted sequencing of the MYB gene locus. 
In summary, detecting differentially methylated CpG sites 
in potential disease-related genes and pathways, we hypothesize 
DNA methylation and epigenetic regulation to play an important 
role in disease onset of premature aging diseases, such as HGP 
and WS. With the transcription factor MYB and NF-kappaB 
associated pathways, we do not only suggest potentially novel 
susceptibility genes and signaling cascades, but we also present a 
yet poorly acknowledged way to approach the disease. </p>

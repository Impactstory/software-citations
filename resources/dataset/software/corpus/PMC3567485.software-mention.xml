<p>Pseudogenes are genomic DNA sequences homologous to 
functional genes yet are not translated into proteins (1). 
Although pseudogenes are often considered the structur-
ally defective non-functional copies of protein-coding 
genes, the human genome comprises more numbers of 
pseudogenes than corresponding functional genes (2). 
Despite the previous assumption of pseudogenes as </p>

<p>genomic fossils, the genome-wide investigations have 
demonstrated actively transcribed pseudogenes (TPGs) 
with functional potential (3-12). For instant, TPG of nitric 
oxide synthase ( NOS) acts as an antisense regulator of 
neuronal NOS protein synthesis in snails (13, 14). Another 
study has established that binding of transcriptional repres-
sor to receptor of makorin1-p1 could activate the hom-
ologous parental gene Mkrn1 (15), despite contradictory </p>

<p>result was also reported (16). In addition, the TPG of 
PTENP1 ( PTEN), a highly conserved processed pseudogene 
of tumour suppressor PTEN, acts as a miRNA-decoy by bind-
ing to PTEN-targeting miRNAs (17). Moreover, human 
pseudogene myosin light chain kinase pseudogene 1 is par-
tially duplicated from the original MYLK gene and pro-
motes cancer cell proliferation (18). Above findings clearly 
suggest that the non-coding RNA products of TPGs may 
play an important role in biogenesis pathway and func-
tional processes. 
The RNA interference (RNAi) is an important component 
of the RNA modulation pathway and is incorporated into 
the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) with a 
sequence-specific manner (19). In mice and fruit flies, 
double-stranded RNAs arising from the antisense/sense 
transcripts of processed pseudogene, and its cognate 
gene, or hairpin structures from inversion and duplication, 
are cut by Dicer into 21 nt endogenous short interfering 
RNAs (esiRNAs) with the ability to bind RISC and regulate 
the expression of parental gene (20-25). Such regulatory 
mechanism in human remains unclear. 
To demonstrate that in human, as in animal models, TPGs 
may generate naturally occurring siRNAs and Piwi interact-
ing RNAs (piRNAs) to regulate the expression of 
protein-coding genes, we have developed a computational 
pipeline and constructed a database-pseudoMap, the map 
for studying pseudogenes. pseudoMap pre-processes the 
raw data of public microarray and deep sequencing data 
into gene expression profiles for both TPG and its cognate 
gene and small RNA (sRNA) profiles for TPG-derived esiRNAs. 
pseudoMap further combined the gene expression profiles 
to construct the TPG-derived esiRNA-target interactions 
(eSTIs). In addition, according to the previous study of 
pseudogene, PTENP1 exerts a miRNA decoy by binding to </p>

<p>cognate-targeting miRNAs (17), and pseudoMap also pro-
vided the 'miRNA regulator' to elucidate the relationship 
of TPG and its cognate gene with miRNA target regulation. </p>

<p>Data generation </p>

<p>In total, more than 20 000 human pseudogenes and their 
cognate genes were obtained from the <rs id="software-0" type="software">Ensembl</rs> Genome

<p>Human Genome U133A/U133Plus2 is a microarray com-
posed of oligonucleotide probes to measure the level of 
transcription of each sequence represented, which included 
transcribed pseudogenes. 1404 pseudogenes have been de-
tectable by this chip, thus considered being transcribed and 
referred as TPGs. Functional sRNAs (fsRNAs) with sequence 
length between 18 to 40 nt were collected from the 
Functional RNA Database (27), which hosts a large collec-
tion of known/predicted non-coding RNA sequences from 
public databases: H-invDB v5.0 (6), FANTOM3 (28), miRBase 
17.0 (29, 30), NONCODE v1.0 (31), Rfam v8.1 (32), RNAdb 
v2.0 (33) and snoRNA-LBME-db rel. 3 (34). The public deep 
sequencing data from sRNA libraries (35-38) were experi-
mented with on human embryo stem cells, liver tissues or 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. Supplementary 
Table 1 summarizes the statistics of the deep sequencing 
data from various sRNA libraries. The genomic sequences

<p>genes, fsRNAs, sRNA deep sequencing data, expression pro-
files, integration of various tools and identification of func-
tions and regulations of TPGs. Based on a genome-wide 
computational pipeline of sequence-alignment approaches, 
this work constructed pseudoMap database for elucidation 
of two major discoveries: TPG-derived eSTI and 
miRNA-decoy mechanism of TPGs. The detailed analyses 
are described below. </p>

<p>Identification of TPG-derived 
esiRNAs by public next-generation 
sequencing data </p>

<p>A computational pipeline was developed to verify the 
hypotheses that human TPGs may generate esiRNAs to regu-
late protein-coding genes (Figure 2). An attempt was made 
to identify the candidates of TPG-derived esiRNAs, by align-
ing the sequences of TPGs and fsRNAs. These candidates 
were verified using the deep sequencing data from various </p>

<p>sRNA libraries (35-38) experimented with on human embryo 
stem cells, liver tissues or HCC tissues. The hairpin structure 
by Mfold (40) was then determined by using the extended 
sequences of these candidates of esiRNAs. In pseudoMap, a 
total of 1232 TPGs may produce esiRNAs, which were profil-
ing by deep sequencing data, within 1404 human TPGs were 
characterized. The information of these TPGs is shown in 
Supplementary File 1. The results showed that 4 miRNAs 
and 326 piRNAs may derive from TPGs. We also found that 
miRNA has-miR-622 was identified, which was derived from 
keratin 18 pseudogene 27, located on nt 858-879, as similar 
as miRBase database. Table 2 summarizes the entire statis-
tical analysis of pseudoMap. </p>

<p>sites within the conserved regions of coding, 5'-UTR and 
3'-UTR of genes were identified in 12 metazoan genomes 
by using three computational approaches, TargetScan (42-
44), miRanda (45) and RNAhybrid (46). The minima free 
energy (MFE) threshold was À20 kcal/mol with a score 
more than or equal to 150 for miRanda and default param-
eters for TargetScan and RNAhybrid. The targets were iden-
tified using the following criteria: (i) the potential target 
sites were determined by at least two approaches; (ii) mul-
tiple target sites were prioritized and (iii) target sites must 
be located in accessible regions. Finally, we provided the 
gene expression profiles of TPG and its cognate gene to 
construct the eSTIs. </p>

<p>Gene expression analysis </p>

<p>The mRNA abundances of TPGs and protein-coding genes 
were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (47), such as 
GDS596 examined from 79 human physiologically normal 
tissues (48), GSE2109 examined from 2158 samples with 61 
tumour tissues, GSE3526 examined from 353 samples with 
65 normal tissues (49) and GSE5364 examined from primary 
human tumours and adjacent non-tumour tissues, which 
include 270 tumours and 71 normal-cancer pairs from pa-
tients with breast, colon, liver, lung, oesophagal and thy-
roid cancers (50). Moreover, the Pearson correlation 
coefficient was computed from TPGs and protein-coding 
genes. </p>

<p>miRNAs, therefore resulting their cognate genes to escape 
miRNA-mediated repression. In this study, we analyse the 
relationships between TPG and its cognate gene with 
miRNA decoys mechanism to examine miRNA-target inter-
actions (MTIs) by performing a pipeline. First, the parental 
genes were obtained by mapping the TPGs and genomic 
sequences with the BLAST (51) program. The MTIs with 
TPGs and parental genes were then investigated using 
our previous approach (41). The MFE threshold was 
À20 kcal/mol with a score more than or equal to 150 for 
miRanda and default parameters for TargetScan and 
RNAhybrid. Finally, the TPGs and their cognates 
co-regulated by miRNAs were obtained. The miRNA and 
3'UTR sequences were obtained from miRBase R18 </p>

<p>(29, 30) and <rs type="software">Ensembl</rs> Genome Browser release 63 (26), re-
spectively. Analysis results indicated that 874 miRNAs with 
MFE À20 and Score ! 150 interact with many possible 
target sites in 248 TPGs and their cognate genes and 
might potentially co-regulate this pair of TPG and parental 
gene (Supplementary File 2). </p>

<p>As a web-based system, pseudoMap can thoroughly iden-
tify TPGs, including TPGs act as a miRNA regulators and 
TPGs-derived eSTIs in humans. There are two ways to

by searching for a particular TPG. Figure 3A displays the </p>

tionships of TPG and its cognate gene with miRNA-
mediated repression termed as 'miRNA Regulator', 
TPG-derived eSTIs named as 'esiRNA', and 'Expression' 
showed the gene expression profiles. Figure 3B provides a 
detailed view of miRNA regulator, which displays more 
fine-grained information. Above results indicated the rela-
tionships between TPGs and cognate genes by a miRNA 
decoy mechanism such as that observed by Poliseno et al. 
(17). The 'Expression' presents the gene expression profiles 
of not only distinct TPG and corresponding parental gene 
but also TPG referenced by cognate in various experimental 
conditions (Figure 3C). Moreover, the view of esiRNA indi-
cates the TPG-derived esiRNAs and graphical display of

mate the eSTIs (Figure 3E) and the RNA folding structure of 
TPG-derived esiRNA (Figure 3F). All the results and se-
quences can be downloaded for further experimental 
tests. In pseudoMap, we also incorporate the external 
sources, such as UCSC genome browser (39) for a genomic 
view, GeneCards (52) for gene annotation and miRBase (29) 
for miRNA annotation (Figure 3G). In addition, pseudoMap 
also consists of a tutorial and knowledge of pseudogenes.

<p>Construction and content </p>

<p>In pseudoMap, various databases are integrated and main-
tained with <rs id="software-5" type="software">MySQL</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-5" type="url">http://www.mysql.com</rs>/) relational 
database management system. While operating on an 
<rs id="software-6" type="software">Apache HTTP server</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-6" type="url">http://www.apache.org</rs>/) and PHP 
(http://www.php.net/) on a <rs id="software-7" type="software">Linux operation system</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-7" type="url">http:// www.linux.com</rs>), pseudoMap was constructed using the 
Smarty template engine (http://www.smarty.net). Based 
on PHP, JavaScript (http://www.javascriptsource.com/), CSS 
(http://www.w3schools.com/css/) and HTML (http://www. 
w3schools.com/html/) languages, the web interface enables 
dynamic <rs type="software">MySQL</rs> queries with user-friendly graphics. Above 
software are open source technologies. </p>

<p>Discussion and conclusions </p>

<p>Comparison with other previous databases related to 
pseudogenes </p>

<p>A few databases have been constructed to explore pseudo-
genes. In particular, PseudoGene database (53) identifies 
pseudogenes using various computational methods in 
genomes; HOPPSIGEN (54) represents the homologous pro-
cessed pseudogenes shared between the mouse and human 
genomes that contains location information and potential 
function; as a web-based system, <rs type="software">PseudoGeneQuest</rs> (55) 
identifies novel human pseudogenes based on a user-
provided protein sequence; in addition, the University of 
Iowa's UI Pseudogenes website contains human pseudo-
genes and the candidates for gene conversion (56). 
However, these databases focus on automatic detection 
of pseudogenes by using a variety of homology-based 
approaches. Our database, pseudoMap, aims at providing 
comprehensive resource for genome-wide identifying the 
functions and regulators of human TPGs. In briefly, there 
are three major differentiating features from currently 
public databases of pseudogenes. First, pseudoMap eluci-
dates the relationships of TPG and its cognate gene with 
miRNA decoys mechanism. Second, to explore the inter-
action of TPG and its parental gene, pseudoMap provides 
the gene expression profiles of TPG and its cognate gene in 
various experimental conditions. Third, pseudoMap curates 
the TPG-derived esiRNAs, which supported by deep sequen-
cing data, as well as their interacting gene targets in the 
human genome. Table 3 lists the detailed comparisons of 
pseudoMap with other previous databases related to 
pseudogenes. </p>

<p>Applications </p>

<p>PseudoMap provides two major applications. One is the 
non-coding RNA products of TPGs, as like animal models, 
that may generate esiRNAs to regulate protein-coding 
genes in humans. In this process, pseudoMap supplies 
next-generation sequencing data from sRNA libraries to </p>

<p>support the candidates of TPG-derived esiRNAs and 
gene expression profiles to verify the target interactions, 
respectively. Another application is that both the gene 
and pseudogene contain miRNA target sites, if the 
pseudogene competes for the freely available repressor 
molecules that would be free the gene to reduce the 
miRNA-mediated repression. Another words, the 
pseudogene may act as a 'miRNA decoy' to release the re-
pression of its cognate gene. pseudoMap provides another 
insight into the pathway of MTIs with TPG-mediated 
mechanism. </p>

<p>Conclusion </p>

<p>In this study, we performed a computational pipeline to 
identify TPG-derived esiRNAs-target interactions and con-
structed a comprehensive database to represent the poten-
tial functions and regulators of TPGs in human. To our 
knowledge, the pseudoMap is the first database to identify 
TPGs to enable biologists and bioinformaticians to eluci-
date two major discoveries, the relationships between 
TPG and its cognate gene with miRNA decoyed mechanisms 
and TPG-derived eSTIs. Efforts are underway in our labora-
tory to expand the methods used in pseudoMap to other 
species such as mice, fruit flies and plants. The pseudoMap 
will be updated frequently by continuingly surveying ex-
perimentally validated sRNAs and will be maintained with 
a long-term support from National Chiao Tung University 
and National Science Council at Taiwan. This novel and cre-
ative resource is now freely available at http://pseudomap.

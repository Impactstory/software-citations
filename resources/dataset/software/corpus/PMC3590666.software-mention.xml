<p>Background: To examine the association between level and patterns of baseline intra-tumoural BRAF 
V600E protein expression and </p>

<p>clinical outcome of BRAF 
V600E melanoma patients treated with selective BRAF inhibitors. </p>

<p>Methods: Fifty-eight BRAF 
V600E metastatic melanoma patients treated with dabrafenib or vemurafenib on clinical trials had pre-</p>

<p>treatment tumour BRAF 
V600E protein expression immunohistochemically (IHC) assessed using the BRAF V600E mutant-specific </p>

<p>antibody VE1. Sections were examined for staining intensity (score 1-3) and percentage of immunoreactive tumour cells, and from 
this an immunoreactive score (IRS) was derived (intensity Ã‚ per cent positive/10). The presence of intra-tumoural heterogeneity for 
BRAF 
V600E protein expression was also assessed. BRAF 
V600E expression was correlated with RECIST response, time to best </p>

<p>response (TTBR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). </p>

<p>Results: Expression was generally high (median IRS 28 (range 5-30)) and homogeneous (78%). Expression of mutated protein 
BRAF 
V600E as measured by intensity, per cent immunoreactive cells, or IRS did not correlate with RECIST response, TTBR, PFS or </p>

<p>OS, including on multivariate analysis. Heterogeneity of staining was seen in 22% of cases and did not correlate with outcome. </p>

<p>Conclusion: In the current study population, IHC-measured pre-treatment BRAF 
V600E protein expression does not predict </p>

<p>response or outcome to BRAF inhibitor therapy in BRAF 
V600E metastatic melanoma patients. </p>

<p>Constitutive activating mutations in the BRAF gene occur in 
B50% of melanomas, of which 70-90% result in a single-amino 
acid substitution of valine for glutamic acid at residue 600 (V600E) 
(Thomas et al, 2007; Long et al, 2011; Jakob et al, 2012; Moreau </p>

<p>et al, 2012). The selective BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and 
dabrafenib have proved to be highly effective in targeting the 
oncogenic BRAF protein in metastatic melanoma patients, with a 
rapid mode of action, high response rates of B50%, and an </p>

<p>improvement in progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) 
compared with dacarbazine (Flaherty et al, 2010; Chapman et al, 
2011; Falchook et al, 2012; Hauschild et al, 2012; Sosman et al, 
2012). 
There is a wide spectrum of response to BRAF inhibitors. The 
minority of BRAF 
V600E melanoma patients (3-5%) have no 
response, while a few have a complete response (3-5%) 
(Chapman et al, 2011, 2012; Hauschild et al, 2012). The majority 
of patients have a rapid early response but subsequently progress 
with a median progression-free interval of 6-7 months (Chapman 
et al, 2011; Hauschild et al, 2012). No biomarker assessed to date is 
able to predict the clinical outcome (response, PFS and OS) of 
patients treated with BRAF inhibitors. Such a marker would not 
only be of use to guide expectations of outcomes from treatment, 
but may also assist in the selection of patients who may be more 
appropriately managed with other therapies (e.g., combined BRAF 
inhibition with other targeted/immunological drugs) at initial 
diagnosis, rather than after initial treatment failure. 
Mutated BRAF protein is an attractive biomarker to examine for 
several reasons; First, it is the protein product of the driver 
oncogene in this melanoma subgroup, and is the specific drug 
target of BRAF inhibitors. Second, BRAF 
V600E copy number gain 
has been shown to result in BRAF 
V600E protein overexpression 
which can confer aquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors (Shi et al, 
2012). Direct assessment of mutant BRAF protein expression 
therefore, may be predictive of clinical outcome after BRAF 
inhibitor therapy. 
We have previously shown that immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
with the BRAF 
V600E VE1 antibody is highly sensitive (97%) and 
specific (98%) for the detection of genomic BRAF 
V600E mutation 
status (Long et al, 2013). Detection of the target protein of the 
BRAF inhibitor using IHC has a number of advantages over other 
molecular mutation testing techniques. Not only can it provide a 
result very quickly utilising a technique readily available in most 
pathology laboratories, but it also allows accurate determination of 
BRAF mutation status in specimens containing a very low number 
of tumour cells and has the advantage of quantification and cellular 
localisation of the mutated BRAF 
V600E protein within a lesion. 
Additionally, we have observed heterogeneity of mutated 
BRAF 
V600E protein expression in BRAF 
V600E mutant melanoma 
biopsies from patients (Long et al, 2013). 
Therefore, we sought to examine whether the level and patterns 
of expression of BRAF 
V600E mutant protein could predict the 
outcome in BRAF 
V600E melanoma patients treated with a BRAF 
inhibitor. We hypothesised that patients with low or heterogeneous 
expression of mutant BRAF 
V600E protein would have a poor 
response to treatment with BRAF inhibitors and reduced survival, 
compared with patients with high and homogeneous expression. </p>

<p>PATIENTS AND METHODS </p>

<p>Patient selection and study design. This study comprised a 
cohort of metastatic melanoma patients who received a BRAF 
inhibitor as part of clinical trials at Melanoma Institute Australia 
between 2009-2011. Patients eligible for these clinical trials had 
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage IV BRAF-
mutant melanoma and were treated on the Phase 1/2, 2 and 3 trials 
with dabrafenib (Trefzer et al, 2011; Falchook et al, 2012; 
Hauschild et al, 2012), the phase 2 brain metastasis trial with 
dabrafenib (Long et al, 2012), or the Phase 2 and 3 and expanded 
access trials with vemurafenib (Chapman et al, 2011; Larkin et al, 
2012; Sosman et al, 2012). The selection criteria for the current 
study included all patients diagnosed with a BRAF 
V600E mutation 
via somatic mutation testing, who received a BRAF inhibitor on the 
abovementioned clinical trials, and had sufficient archival tissue to </p>

<p>perform IHC. Patients who did not receive the recommended 
phase 2 doses (RP2D) of vemurafenib (960 mg BD) or dabrafenib 
(total daily dose of 300 mg) were excluded. Patients who 
discontinued therapy before best response were also excluded. 
Seven non-BRAF 
V600E patients were selected to serve as controls. 
Clinical and follow-up details were collected and analysed on all 
patients as approved by the Westmead and Royal Prince Alfred 
Hospital Research Ethics Committees. </p>

<p>Drug treatment. All patients treated with vemurafenib received 
960 mg twice daily. All patients treated with dabrafenib received 
150 mg twice daily from study commencement, or received Xdaily 
RP2D of 300 mg after first tumour assessment as per the respective 
clinical trial protocols (Trefzer et al, 2011; Falchook et al, 2012; 
Hauschild et al, 2012; Long et al, 2012). </p>

<p>Response to treatment and clinical outcome. Objective response 
to BRAF inhibitor treatment was assessed with computed 
tomography (CT) imaging 6-9 weekly as part of the aforemen-
tioned trials, using RECIST 1.0 (Therasse et al, 2000) for those 
enroled in the phase 1/2 dabrafenib trial, and RECIST 1.1 
(Eisenhauer et al, 2009) for the other trials. Clinical outcome was 
assessed using time to best response (TTBR), PFS and OS from 
commencement of BRAF inhibitor. Upon disease progression, 
patients were allowed to continue BRAF inhibitor therapy at the 
discretion of the treating physician if it was determined they were 
receiving ongoing clinical benefit. </p>

<p>Immunohistochemistry (IHC). Anti-BRAF 
V600E immunostaining 
was performed on the same tissue block used for mutation testing, 
using the monoclonal mouse antibody VE1 (Heidelberg, Germany) 
as described previously on 4 mm-thick tissue sections of formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour tissue blocks (Capper 
et al, 2011, 2012; Long et al, 2013). Briefly, sections were stained 
with undiluted hybridoma supernatant of BRAF 
V600E -specific 
clone VE1 (provided by Andreas von Deimling, now commercially 
available at Spring Bioscience, Pleasanton, CA, USA) on a Ventana 
BenchMark XT immunostainer (Ventana Medical Systems, 
Tucson, AZ, USA). The Ventana staining procedure included 
pre-treatment with cell conditioner 1 (pH 8) for 60 min, followed 
by incubation with the VE1 antibody at 37 1C for 32 min. Antibody 
incubation was followed by standard signal amplification with the 
Ventana amplifier kit, ultra-Wash, counterstaining with one drop 
of haematoxylin for 4 min and one drop of bluing reagent for 
4 min. For chromogenic detection, ultraView Universal DAB 
detection kit (Ventana Medical Systems) was used. Subsequently, 
slides were removed from the immunostainer, washed in water 
with a drop of dishwashing detergent and mounted. No 
chromogen was detected when the primary antibody BRAF 
V600E clone VE1 was omitted. Cases with BRAF wild-type 
(n Â¼ 2) and non-V600E BRAF mutations (n Â¼ 5) were included as 
quality controls. </p>

<p>Immunohistochemical staining evaluation. All immunostained 
slides were evaluated twice by two independent observers (JSW 
and RAS) blinded to all clinical, histopathological and mutation 
data. The BRAF 
V600E VE1 antibody staining was scored for the 
percentage of immunoreactive cells. Intensity of staining was 
judged on a semi-quantitative scale of 0-3 Ã¾ : no staining (0), 
weakly positive staining (1 Ã¾ ), moderately positive staining (2 Ã¾ ) 
and strongly positive staining (3 Ã¾ ) (Figure 1A-D). An immunor-
eactive score (IRS) was derived by multiplying the percentage 
of positive cells with staining intensity divided by 10 (i.e., 
IRS potenital range: 0-30). Slides that differed by an IRS of 
45 between the two observers were then viewed by both observers 
together to reach agreement on any discordant scores. Addition-
ally, sections were assessed for homogenous or heterogeneous 
expression of BRAF 
V600E protein. Heterogeneous expression was 
defined as the presence of distinct subpopulations of cells that had </p>

<p>
an immunoreactive intensity score that differed by greater than one 
scoring level (e.g., one population of cells with 3 Ã¾ and another 
with 1 Ã¾ Figure 3A). Cases not fullfilling the above definition of 
heterogeneous were classified as homogenous expression. Cases 
with only isolated single interspersed cells with different intensity 
scores from the majority of the tumour were scored as 
homogenous. The slides were assesed for cytoplasmic staining 
only. Any type of isolated nuclear staining, weak staining of single 
interspersed cells, or staining of monocytes/macrophages was 
scored negative. Heavily pigmented areas were avoided. Melanoma 
cells undergoing early necrosis were excluded, as this has 
previously been shown to affect the antigenicity of the VE1 
epitope (Capper et al, 2011, 2012; Long et al, 2013). </p>

<p>Statistical methods. Statistical analyses were carried out using 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">IBM</rs> <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS Statistic</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">v19.0</rs>. Immunohistochemical results tested for 
association with survival outcomes using Cox regression or 
Kaplan-Meier (log-rank test) included; continuous IRS, contin-
uous percentage of stained cells, categorical staining intensity and 
categorical heterogeneity (also classified as 100% staining vs 
o100% staining). Three survival outcomes were tested; TTBR, 
PFS and OS. All time intervals were measured in relation to the 
commencement of BRAF inhibitor. Follow-up for patients who 
subsequently received dabrafenib and trametinib combination 
(CombiDT) therapy (n Â¼ 5) was censored at date of cross-over to 
CombiDT therapy, as response rates of 19% and a median PFS of 
3.6 months have been reported in this patient population (Flaherty 
et al, 2011). Follow-up for one patient who discontinued therapy 
after best response but before progressive disease was censored at 
date of BRAF inhibitor cessation. Multivariate survival models 
were also tested for PFS and OS in the overall cohort adjusting for 
age, sex, presence of active (untreated, or previously treated but 
relapsed) brain metastases (BM), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
level, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance 
status and ongoing treatment with BRAF inhibitor after RECIST-
defined disease progression. Pearson's correlation and Mann-
Whitney U-methods were used to test all staining parameters for 
association with best CT response in terms of best per cent change 
(sum of diameters target lesions baseline to best response) and also 
coded categorically as a partial response; no patient experienced a 
complete response. A subgroup response and survival correlate 
analysis was conducted excluding patients who had BM at trial 
commencement. </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>Comparison of BRAF 
V600E IHC and genomic mutation testing. 
Immunohistochemistry was performed on a total of 66 patient 
biopsies for this study. All cases with wild-type or non-V600E 
BRAF on mutation testing (n Â¼ 7) did not show immunoreactivity 
to the BRAF 
V600E antibody. One of 59 BRAF 
V600E patient biopsies 
displayed no immunoreactivity, and subsequent repeat genomic 
retesting of this tumour confirmed a BRAF 
V600D mutation 
(Figure 1D). This patient was excluded from all subsequent 
analyses. </p>

<p>patients were included in the analysis (Table 1), of whom 47 (81%) 
received dabrafenib, and 11 (19%) received vemurafenib. Eighteen 
(31%) patients had active (untreated, or previously treated but 
progressive) BM at trial entry. Fifty-two (90%) patients had AJCC 
Stage M1c disease, 41 (71%) achieved a partial response to therapy 
and 5 (8%) patients received subsequent CombiDT as part of the 
phase 1/2 clinical trial (Flaherty et al, 2011). Mutation testing and 
IHC was performed on 50 metastatic melanoma tissues and in 
eight patients the primary melanoma tissue was used. </p>

<p>VE1 immunoreactivity characteristics. The IRS score from each 
observer differed by a score of 45 in five of the 58 cases. These 
discordent cases were assessed by both obersvers together to reach 
an agreement on the score. In general, most BRAF 
V600E melanomas 
stained intensely and homogeneously. Mean and median IRS were 
24 and 28, respectively (range 5-30, out of a maximum score of 30) 
(Figure 2). Staining intensity was strong in 36 cases (62.0%), 
moderate in 20 (34.5%) and weak in two cases (3.5%). Forty one 
cases (71%) displayed 100% of tumour cells staining, 10 cases 
(17%) had 80-99% staining, and 7 (12%) had o80% staining (the 
lowest staining was 40%) (Table 2). The IRS score of primary and 
metastatic melanoma cases was similar, with a median IRS of 29 
and 28, respectively. Tumour cell subpopulations with hetero-
geneous immunoreaction were noted in 13 cases (25% of primary 
and 22% of metastatic melanomas) (Figure 3A-C). </p>

<p>Association of VE1 immunoreactivity and patient outcome. No 
immunoreactivity variable correlated with TTBR, PFS or OS, and 
no trends were seen on Kaplan-Meier analysis (Table 3). 
Immunoreactive score, staining intensity, percentage of stained 
cells and heterogeneity did not correlate with PFS or OS, including 
on multivariate analysis adjusting for age, sex, ECOG, LDH, M 
stage, the presence of BM and ongoing BRAF inhibitor treatment 
after disease progression Figure 4. No immunoreactivity variable 
correlated with RECIST response, when examined either categori-
cally or continuously (Table 3). </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>This study suggests that IHC BRAF 
V600E protein expression does 
not predict the response or survival of patients receiving BRAF 
inhibitors. It was found that BRAF 
V600E protein is usually highly 
expressed in BRAF 
V600E mutant melanomas but occasionally in a 
heterogeneous fashion. These results strongly imply that there are 
more important modifiers of patient response and outcome than 
BRAF 
V600E protein expression. 
Strengths of the current study include the performance and 
scoring of IHC staining blinded to clinical data, the independent 
determination of protein expression by two separate investigators, 
the various measures of expression used, and detailed clinical data 
in a large patient cohort recruited from contemporary prospective 
therapy trials. In addition, the analysis accounted for subsequent </p>

active therapies received that may have confounded survival 
analysis. Furthermore, the IHC technique was standardised and 
utilised archival paraffin pre-treatment samples. 
Although we demonstrated that protein expression varied 
between patients, there was no correlation between the level of 
mutant BRAF protein expression and response to BRAF inhibitors 
or survival in treated patients. One possible explanation for this 
relates to the method of detecting BRAF expression. The 
concentration of the VE1 antibody used in this study was 
optimised to maximise the sensitivity and specificity for BRAF </p>

<p>V600E </p>

<p>protein detection. As a consequence, the vast majority of cases 
produced a strong degree of staining intensity, which resulted in 
reduced variation of the staining intensity between the cases. It is 
unlikely that the use of an alternate scoring systems would produce 
significant results, as none of the individual scoring parameters 
(percentage positive and staining intensity) were correlative with 
any response or outcomes data. An increased dilution of the VE1 
antibody may provide a greater separation of those cases with very 
high expression (albeit at the risk of not detecting any expression 
in the lower expressing tumours) and requires further assessment 
as a tool for predicting responses to treatment with BRAF 
inhibitors. Another explanation could be that the heterogeneity 
in staining signal intensity seen between individual cases is 
influenced by pre-analytical parameters, for example, tissue 
handling during and after resection, length of tissue fixation in 
formaldehyde or tissue storage conditions. Previous studies using 
the VE1 antibody have shown loss of BRAF 
V600E expression in 
pre(semi)-necrotic tissue (Capper et al, 2012). Other techniques to 
quantify BRAF expression levels, such as RNA expression 
microarray analysis, RT-PCR or proteomics, may provide 
improved predictive power. 
A more likely explanation for the lack of correlation of 
BRAF 
V600E protein expression and clinical outcome is that 
melanoma proliferation and survival is determined by a complex 
array of molecular events, and the effect of BRAF inhibition is 
similarly complex, so that examination of the level of expression of 
a single biomarker (even though it is thought to be the main driver 
of tumour growth and survival) at a single time point, in only one 
tumour manifestation, cannot account for differences in overall 
tumour response and survival seen in patients. Analysis of activity 
of multiple aspects of cell signalling pathways and processes (e.g., 
MAPK, PI3K, Wnt, NFKB, apoptotic, cell cycling, tumour 
microenvironment, immune regulation) may be required to predict 
the clinical effect of subsequent BRAF inhibition. 
Heterogeneity of BRAF 
V600E staining intensity was seen within 
tumours in a subgroup of patients in this study, often 
corresponding to areas of morphological heterogeneity. Previous 
studies of heterogeneity focused on the BRAF genotype, comparing 
various mutation testing techniques in whole tumours, </p>

<p>microdissection of tumours, or single-cell analyses (Lin et al, 
2009; Wilmott et al, 2012; Yancovitz et al, 2012). The latter 
techniques are time consuming, costly and cannot be readily 
performed on a large number of tumour samples, as was done in

tumoural heterogeneity, allowing subsequent intra-tumoural 
sampling to occur, such as microdissection, followed by detailed 
molecular testing. 
One case in this study highlighted the importance of IHC 
assessment of genomic BRAF 
V600E mutation status. In this case, a 
tumour initially thought to be BRAF 
V600E on allele-specific PCR 
testing displayed no immunoreactivity with the BRAF 
V600E anti-
body and was found to carry the BRAF 
V600D mutation on 
subsequent exon 15 DNA sequencing. This patient had a poor 
response to BRAF inhibition and short survival, worse than that 
expected in BRAF 
V600E melanoma, and more in keeping with non-
V600E BRAF 
V600 mutations (such as V600K/R/D) (Trefzer et al, 
2011; Long et al, 2012). IHC assessment may therefore be a useful 
tool in combination with genomic testing to accurately predict 
tumour BRAF 
V600E status. 
The results of this study require confirmation in subsequent 
studies. The issue of inter-tumoral heterogeneity was not assesed in 
the current study. Multiple tumours within a patient have been 
shown to respond heterogenously to BRAF inhibitor treatment 
(Carlino et al, 2013), therefore future studies that account for inter-
tumoral heterogeneity by assesing multiple patient tumours should 
be conducted. If a lack of predictive power of the BRAF </p>

<p>V600E </p>

<p>antibody or additional measures of BRAF protein expression is 
confirmed, it suggests there may be other strong modulators of 
BRAF inhibitor response, over and above BRAF 
V600E protein 
expression, and these may be readily targeted with drugs. Further 
research into mutant BRAF protein expression at baseline, during 
treatment, and upon development of disease progression, as well as 
a search for other modulators of response to BRAF inhibitors, is 
therefore likely to be important. </p>

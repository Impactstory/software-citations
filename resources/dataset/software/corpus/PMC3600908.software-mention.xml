<p>CCR9 and 47 are the major trafficking receptors for lymphocyte migration to the gut, 
and their expression is induced during lymphocyte activation under the influence of reti-
noic acid (RA). We report here that BATF (basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-
like), an AP-1 protein family factor, is required for optimal expression of CCR9 and 47 
by T helper cells. BATF-deficient (knockout [KO]) mice had reduced numbers of effector T 
and regulatory T cells in the intestine. The intestinal T cells in BATF KO mice expressed 
CCR9 and 47 at abnormally low levels compared with their wild-type (WT) counterparts, 
and BATF KO CD4 + T cells failed to up-regulate the expression of CCR9 and 47 to WT 
levels in response to RA. Defective binding of RAR and histone acetylation at the regula-
tory regions of the CCR9 and Itg-4 genes were observed in BATF KO T cells. As a result, 
BATF KO effector and FoxP3 + T cells failed to populate the intestine, and neither popula-
tion functioned normally in the induction and regulation of colitis. Our results establish 
BATF as a cellular factor required for normal expression of CCR9 and 47 and for the 
homeostasis and effector functions of T cell populations in the intestine. </p>

<p>for 47 were reduced in the small intestinal LP of BATF 
KO mice (Fig. 2, A and B). A considerable decrease in CCR9 
and 47 expression was also detected in CD8 + T cells in the 
small intestine but not in other organs (Fig. 2 C). </p>

<p>Naive BATF KO CD4 + T cells are ineffective 
in up-regulating CCR9 and 47 in response to RA 
Expression of CCR9 and 47 by T cells is induced by RA 
(Iwata et al., 2004). We next examined whether BATF KO 
naive T cells are defective in upregulating trafficking recep 
tors in response to T cell activation in the presence of RA 
in vitro. Compared with WT CD4 + T cells, BATF KO naive 
T cells showed less upregulation of CCR9 in response to 
RA (Fig. 3 A). Similarly, BATF KO naive T cells were unable 
to upregulate 47 to WT levels. Similar results were ob 
tained with concanavalin A (Fig. 3 A) or with OVA 323-339 when 
OTII BATF KO T cells were used (not depicted). At the 
mRNA level, expression of both CCR9 and Itg-4 in re 
sponse to RA was defective in BATF KO T cells (Fig. 3 B). 
However, expression of Itg-7 mRNA by BATF KO T cells 
was comparable with WT T cells. We examined other chemo 
kine receptors such as CCR4, CCR6, CCR7, and CXCR4 
(Fig. 3 C) and did not detect any significant differences in 
expression of these receptors between WT and BATF KO 
T cells cultured with or without RA. RA enhances the induc 
tion of FoxP3 + T cells by TGF1 (Kang et al., 2007; Mucida 
et al., 2007), and this response was intact in BATF KO T cells 
(Fig. 3 D). However, BATF KO T regulatory cells (iT reg cells) 
induced with RA and TGF1 were deficient in expression 
of CCR9 and 47 (Fig. 3 E). These results indicate that 
expression of guthoming receptors in BATF KO T helper 
cells to RA is defective, whereas differentiation of T reg cells 
was normal. </p>

<p>BATF KO T cells regain the ability to express 47 
and CCR9 upon gene complementation 
It is possible that BATF KO T cells are defective in ex 
pression of CCR9 and 47 as the result of a block in cell 
development rather than the absence of functional BATF. 
This was addressed using retroviral gene complementation 
in BATF KO T cells. We constructed retroviral vectors 
expressing the fulllength and two truncated versions of 
BATF and used these to complement the BATF deficiency 
in T cells (Fig. 4 A). Enforced BATF expression induced a 
low level of 47 but did not induce CCR9 in the absence 
of exogenous RA (Fig. 4, B and C). This modest induc 
tion of 47 is likely caused by residual RA that is present 
in the culture medium. BATF KO CD4 + T cells were able 
to normally express CCR9 and 47 in response to RA 
when the fulllength BATF protein was expressed (Fig. 4, 
B and C). A low but detectable activity was observed for 
a BATF mutant deleted for the first exon (BATF2), and this 
was predicted because the protein retains the Jun dimeriza 
tion and DNAbinding domains of BATF (Fig. 4, B and C). 
In contrast, a nonfunctional BATF protein deleted for the 
first and second exons (BATF1) did not have such activities. </p>

<p>BATF (basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATFlike) 
is a basic leucine zipper (bZip) transcription factor of the AP1 
protein family (Dorsey et al., 1995). BATF is widely expressed 
in the immune system, including T and B cells. It hetero 
dimerizes with Jun proteins for transcriptional regulatory activity 
(Dorsey et al., 1995; Echlin et al., 2000; Williams et al., 2001). 
BATF is required for the generation of Th17 cells and TFh 
cells but is dispensable for development of Th1 cells and FoxP3 + 
T cells (Schraml et al., 2009; Betz et al., 2010; Ise et al., 2011). 
It has been reported that BATF can suppress Sirt1 expression 
and control the ATP level and effector function of CD8 + 
T cells (Kuroda et al., 2011). Additionally, BATF deficiency is 
associated with the loss of activationinduced cytidine deami 
nase (AID) expression and class switch recombination in B cells 
(Betz et al., 2010; Ise et al., 2011), and BATF recently has been 
shown to regulate a DNA damage-induced differentiation 
checkpoint important for the maintenance of hematopoietic 
stem cells (Wang et al., 2012). 
We report here that BATF is required for optimal ex 
pression of CCR9 and 47 by guthoming CD4 + T cells 
in response to the RA signal. BATF KO mice are numeri 
cally deficient for T cells in the intestine. BATFdeficient 
effector T helper cells and FoxP3 + T cells are ineffective in 
migration into the intestine and fail to function as effector 
cells and suppressor cells, respectively. BATF is required for 
CD4 + T cells to upregulate the guthoming receptors in 
response to RA upon antigen priming and to migrate into 
and populate the intestine. </p>

<p>RESULTS 
T helper cells are numerically deficient 
in the intestine of BATF KO mice 
BATF KO mice generated by targeted deletion of either 
exons one and two or exon three of the Batf gene have been 
previously described to have relatively normal numbers of 
T cells in secondary lymphoid tissues (Schraml et al., 2009; 
Betz et al., 2010). When we examined the intestine by immuno 
histochemistry, CD4 + T cells were numerically deficient in 
the LP compartment of the small intestinal villi (Fig. 1 A). 
CD8 + T cells were present but also decreased in numbers in 
the small intestinal villi of the BATF KO mice. Flow cytome 
try analysis revealed that the frequency of CD4 + T cells was 
decreased significantly in the colon and the small intestinal LP 
(Fig. 1 B). CD4 + T cells were decreased also in PPs but not in 
the mesenteric LN (MLN). When FoxP3 + CD4 + T cells were 
examined, they were more decreased in the colon and the 
small intestine than in MLN or PPs (Fig. 1, B and C). CD8 + 
T cells were significantly decreased in PPs and the small intes 
tine (Fig. 1, A-C). 
In an effort to provide an explanation for the deficiency 
of CD4 + T cells in the intestine, we examined the expression 
of CCR9 and 47 (Fig. 2 A). Both FoxP3 + and FoxP3  
CD4 + T cells in the small intestine of BATF KO mice ex 
pressed CCR9 at reduced levels compared with WT mice 
(Fig. 2, A and B). Numbers of CD4 + FoxP3 + T cells positive </p>

BATF KO T cells cultured in the presence and absence of 
RA (Fig. 5 A). We examined the sequence structure of the

several RAR and BATF binding sites in the 5 upstream 
regions of the mouse CCR9 and Itg4 genes (Fig. S1 and

<p>BATF KO T cells fail to migrate to various compartments 
of the intestine 
Defective expression of CCR9 and 47 is expected to 
negatively influence the homing of BATF KO T cells to 
the gut. We determined the shortterm homing ability of 
BATF KO T cells in vivo. Naive CD4 + T cells from WT 
and BATF KO mice were activated in the presence of RA 
for 6 d and examined for chemotaxis to the CCR9 ligand 
CCL25 in vitro (Fig. 6 A). Chemotaxis by RAtreated 
BATF KO CD4 + T cells was inefficient compared with 
WT T cells (Fig. 6 A), which is explained by the CCR9 
deficiency. When introduced via a tail vein injection and 
examined 20 h later by flow cytometry, RAtreated BATF 
KO CD4 + T cells were poorly represented in the small 
intestine compared with WT T cells (Fig. 6 B). The flow 
cytometry technique is useful for assessing cell migration 
into an organ but cannot accurately evaluate cell migration </p>

<p>presence of RA revealed the binding of RAR and BATF 
to 18 regions in the 44kbp 5 upstream region of the CCR9 
gene as well as to the 5 upstream region of the Itg4 gene 
(Fig. 5, B and C). The binding of RAR to the CCR9 and 
Itg4 genes was abnormally low in BATF KO T cells (Fig. 5, 
B and C). Moreover, the level of acetylated histone 4 pro 
tein was very low in the regulatory regions of CCR9 and 
Itg4 genes. In line with this, the promoter activity of a 
1.3kbp region spanning the 5 upstream regulatory region of 
Itg-4 gene was significantly lower in BATF KO than WT 
T cells (Fig. 5 D). 
Nuclear hormone receptor function involves a series of 
enzymatic modifications of proteins including the acetyla 
tion of histone proteins for gene expression (Rosenfeld et al., 
2006). It has been reported that expression of Sirt1, a histone 
deacetylase (HDAC) class III enzyme, is induced in BATF 
deficiency to decrease acetylation of histones in CD8 + T cells 
(Kuroda et al., 2011). To determine the role of histone acety 
lation in expression of CCR9 and 47 in BATF deficiency, 
we used inhibitors of HDACs (trichostatin A and BML210 
for class I/II; Ex527 for Sirt1). Increased acetylation through </p>

<p>BATF KO CD4 + T cells fail to induce inflammation 
in the intestine 
BATF KO CD4 + T cells may not effectively induce inflam 
mation in the intestine because of their poor migration to 
the tissue. We tested this possibility using the colitis model 
in Rag1 / mice. Rag1 / mice were injected with T reg cell-
depleted naive CD4 + T cells isolated from WT or BATF KO 
mice. Naive BATF KO CD4 + T cells did not decrease the 
weight of Rag1 / mice as effectively as WT T cells (Fig. 8 A). 
Histological examination revealed only mild inflammation 
in the Rag1 / mice injected with naive BATF KO CD4 + 
T cells (Fig. 8 B). This is in contrast to the severe inflamma 
tion seen in both the proximal and distal colon of the Rag1 / 
mice injected with naive WT T cells. The numbers of Th1 
cells, which are the major effector T cells to induce inflamma 
tion in this model, were decreased in the colon of Rag1 / 
mice injected with naive BATF KO CD4 + T cells (Fig. 8 C). 
The specific decrease of Th1 cells in the colon indicates that 
BATF is required for Th1 effector T cell population in the in 
flamed gut tissue. Also decreased were the numbers of Th17 
and T reg cells in the colon and the small intestine (Fig. 8 C). 
This decrease in Th17 cell numbers in all tissues, including the 
spleen, is in line with the previous reports demonstrating that 
BATF KO T cells are impaired in their ability to differentiate 
into Th17 cells (Schraml et al., 2009; Betz et al., 2010). Over 
all, these results demonstrate the defective population and in 
flammatory function of BATF KO T cells in the intestine. </p>

<p>often difficult to locate tissue sites such as small lymphoid 
patches in the intestine. To overcome this issue, we used 
multiphoton microscopy to image wholemounted tis 
sues (Fig. 6 D). Using this technique, we confirmed that 
the migration of BATF KO T cells into the small intestine 
and colon was severely compromised. Additionally, we 
found that migration of RAconditioned BATF KO T cells 
to both colonic patches and PPs was defective as well. 
Threedimensional (3D) images of the differential migration 
into the indicated wholemounted tissues are shown in 
Videos 1-3. </p>

<p>BATF KO mice are defective in forming intestinal FoxP3 +

Oral immunization increases antigenspecific T cells, par 
ticularly FoxP3 + T cells, in the intestine. We examined 
whether antigenspecific (OTII) BATF KO T cells can 
populate the small intestine after mucosal immunization 
with OVA. OVAspecific BATF KO FoxP3 + CD4 + T cells 
failed to populate the small intestine (Fig. 7, A and B). 
However, there was no significant difference in the num 
bers of these cells populating other organs such as PPs, MLN, 
spleen, and peripheral LN (PLN). OVAspecific BATF 
KO FoxP3  nonT reg cells also failed to populate the small 
intestine after immunization, whereas their population in 
other organs except PPs were not affected significantly 
(Fig. 7, A and B). </p>

<p>BATF KO iT reg cells fail to suppress 
inflammation in the intestine 
As shown in Fig. 3 E, iT reg cells derived from naive BATF 
KO CD4 + T cells were deficient in the expression of CCR9 
and 47. We examined whether this deficiency would af 
fect the in vivo suppressive function of BATF KO iT reg cells. 
RAtreated BATF KO iT reg cells were as effective as WT 
iT reg cells in suppressing responder T cells in vitro (Fig. 10 A). 
Thus, function of the BATF KO iT reg cells is intact in vitro. 
We next compared the suppressive functions of CD45.2 + 
iT reg cells generated from naive WT and BATF KO CD4 + 
T cells in vivo in the T cell-induced colitis model. RAtreated

of OTII CD4 + T cells after parenteral immunization was also 
largely intact (Fig. 9 C). Similarly, homeostatic CD4 + T cell 
expansion in lymphopenic Rag1 / mice was slightly de 
creased but was not defective (Fig. 9 D). Absolute numbers 
of BATF KO CD4 + T cells in the spleen and PLN were 
comparable with WT, but the numbers in the intestinal LP 
and the intestinedraining LN (MLN) were decreased as 
expected (Fig. 9 E). These results indicate that general cell 
processes such as cell activation, death, and proliferation ap 
pear largely intact in BATF KO T cells. </p>

<p>important not only for effector T cells in inducing intestinal 
inflammation but also for T reg cells in controlling inflammation. 
The findings implicate BATF as a key regulator of T cell-
mediated immune responses and inflammation in the intestine. 
Our results indicate that BATF deficiency makes CD4 + 
T cells less responsive to the RA signal in upregulating the 
guthoming receptors. RA, produced by gut epithelial cells 
and dendritic cells, is the major inducer of CCR9 and 47. 
In this process, RAR plays an important role as the receptor 
for RA and works together with the TCR activation signal to 
upregulate CCR9 (Iwata et al., 2004). RA also plays an im 
portant role in upregulating the Itg4 subunit of the 47 
integrin (Kang et al., 2011). The Itg7 subunit of 47 is 
expressed constitutively and increased further by TGF1 (Kang 
et al., 2011). Our results indicate that expression of Itg-4, but 
not Itg-7, is defective at the mRNA level in BATF deficiency. 
Defective expression of the guthoming receptors by BATF 
KO CD4 + T cells can result in inefficient migration of these 
T cells into the intestine. The CCR9 ligand, CCL25 (also called 
TECK), is highly expressed in the epithelial cells of the small 
intestine (Kunkel et al., 2000). CCR9 deficiency leads to de 
fective homing of memory T cells into the small intestinal LP 
(Stenstad et al., 2006). 47 is required for migration into the 
whole intestine because its adhesion receptor, MAdCAM1, 
is expressed on intestinal endothelial cells (Sigmundsdottir 
and Butcher, 2008). MAdCAM1 is expressed also on the </p>

<p>activity of WT T cells (Fig. 10 B). Histological examination 
revealed that only WT iT reg cells, but not BATF KO iT reg cells, 
effectively suppressed colitis (Fig. 10 C). BATF KO iT reg cells 
were also less effective than WT iT reg cells in decreasing the 
number of CD45.1 + (WT naive T cell derived) Th1 effector 
cells in the MLN and colon (Fig. 10 D). Th17 cells, which are 
generally suppressed by Th1 cells, were reciprocally increased 
with injection of WT iT reg cells but not with BATF KO 
iT reg cells. Fewer CD45.2 + BATF KO iT reg cells than WT 
iT reg cells were found in the colon but not in the MLN of the 
Rag1 / mice (Fig. 10 E), indicating defective population of 
the transferred BATF KO iT reg cells in the colon but not in 
the MLN in the inflammatory condition. Overall, these results 
demonstrate that BATF is required for the in vivo population 
of T reg cells in the gut and their regulatory activity on the 
Th1 cell activity and tissue inflammation. </p>

<p>DISCUSSION 
Our study identified BATF as a cellular factor required for 
the optimal expression of CCR9 and 47 by T cells, partic 
ularly CD4 + T cells, in response to RA. We provided evidence 
that naive CD4 + T cells require BATF to upregulate the gut 
homing receptors during T cell activation and differentiation. 
BATF is important for the expression of guthoming recep 
tors by both effector cells and FoxP3 + T reg cells. Moreover, this 
role of BATF in regulating guthoming receptor expression is </p>

normally induced population of T cells in PPs and other lym 
phoid tissues such as spleen and PLN. This is perhaps because 
T cell migration to secondary lymphoid tissues involves traf 
ficking receptors that are not regulated by BATF. In this re 
gard, it has been shown that T cell migration into PPs can be 
mediated also by an 47independent mechanism mediated 
by Lselectin (Bargatze et al., 1995; Warnock et al., 2000). 
Our results indicate that BATF deficiency has a signifi 
cant functional consequence on the induction and regulation 
of tissue inflammation in the intestine. BATF KO T cells fail 
to induce colitis in Rag1 / mice. Also, BATF KO FoxP3 + 
T cells fail to suppress colitis induced by inflammatory T cells. </p>

<p>endothelial cells in PPs (Streeter et al., 1988), and therefore, 
BATF KO T cells with low 47 expression are inefficient 
for migration into PPs. Additionally, migration of BATF KO 
T cells to colonic patches was defective, indicating that BATF 
expression is important for T cell migration into the gut 
associated lymphoid tissues and nonlymphoid tissue areas. 
Oral or intragastric immunization induces immune toler 
ance in the intestine in part by generating guthoming T reg cells 
in the intestine (Thorstenson and Khoruts, 2001; Nagatani 
et al., 2004). Guthoming receptors such as CCR9 and 47 
are required for the proper induction of immune tolerance in 
the intestine, probably because of the need for efficient mi 
gration of T reg cells into the intestine in the process (Cassani 
et al., 2011). Our results revealed that BATF deficiency leads 
to defective population of T reg cells in the small intestine after </p>

<p>of BATF KO T cells in response to antigens and in a lympho 
penic condition are not impaired. 
The result of our retroviral gene transfer study demon 
strated that BATF expression allows BATF KO T cells to re 
gain sensitivity to the RA signal and upregulate the two 
homing receptors. How BATF regulates gene expression and 
cell function is an active area of research. The in vitro analysis 
of BATF function indicates a role for the protein in the sup 
pression of AP1 transcriptional activity (Echlin et al., 2000). 
BATF inhibits expression of the nicotinamide adenine di 
nucleotide (NAD + )-dependent deacetylase Sirt1, which in turn 
results in increased Tbet expression (Kuroda et al., 2011). In 
contrast, BATF has been shown to be associated with tran 
scriptional activation of several genes in Th17 cells and with 
the induction of AID (Schraml et al., 2009; Ise et al., 2011). 
BATF and IRF4 can cooperate to induce the IL10, IL-17a, 
and IL-21 genes in T cells and to regulate the development </p>

<p>In an inflammatory condition, BATF KO effector Th1 cells 
and FoxP3 + T cells failed to populate the colon. These results 
suggest that BATF is important for the generation of func 
tionally competent effector and suppressor T cells with a nor 
mal gut migratory capacity. Although this study focuses on the 
migration aspect, BATF is known to have additional func 
tions in regulation of T cell function. Although BATF is not 
required to generate Th1 cells and FoxP3 + T cells, BATF is 
required to generate Th17 cells and TFh cells. It has been re 
ported that BATF is required for generation of effector CD8 + 
T cells (Kuroda et al., 2011) and for a check point in the self 
renewal of hematopoietic stem cells in response to DNA 
damage (Wang et al., 2012). Thus, other phenotypes of BATF 
KO mice in addition to the migration defect could contrib 
ute to the ineffective function of effector and suppressor T cells 
in control of tissue inflammation in the intestine. Nevertheless, 
we did confirm that the basic activation, survival, and expansion </p>

<p>Figure 9. BATF KO T cells are largely intact in activation, survival, and proliferation. (A-E) WT and BATF KO CD4 + T cells were examined 
in vitro for activation (A) and survival (B) and in vivo for proliferation (C-E). T cells were activated with anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and IL-2 for 4 d, and ex-
pression of CD69 and CD62L (A) and cell death based on staining with annexin V and propidium iodide (PI; B) were examined. (C) CD45.1 mice were

pressors. In conclusion, this study identified a novel function 
for BATF in upregulating the major guthoming receptors 
on T helper cells. </p>

<p>MATERIALS AND METHODS </p>

<p>Mice. Batf Z/Z mice with the third exon deleted in the Batf gene have 
been described previously (Betz et al., 2010) and will be referred to as 
BATF KO mice in this article. C57BL/6 mice breeding pairs were purchased 
from Harlan. BATF KO mice were backcrossed on the C57BL/6 back 
ground for &gt;10 generations. Congenic CD45.1 C57BL/6, OTII (C57BL/6 
Tg(TcraTcrb)425Cbn/J), and Rag1 / mice (B6.129S7Rag1tm1Mom/J) 
were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. OTII mice were crossed to 
BATF KO mice to generate OTII BATF KO mice. All mice used in this 
study were maintained at Purdue University, and experiments were per 
formed according to approved protocols by the Purdue University Animal 
Care and Use Committee. Generally, the mice were used between 6 and 
8 wk of age at the start of each experiment. </p>

<p>of CD8 + dendritic cells (Glasmacher et al., 2012; Li et al., 
2012; Tussiwand et al., 2012). Several BATF and RAR 
binding sites are present in the 5 regulatory regions of the 
CCR9 and Itg-4 genes. With one exception, all of these bind 
ing sites on the CCR9 gene and all of the BATFbinding sites 
on the Itg-4 gene do not possess the features of AP1-IRF 
composite elements, suggesting that the expression of the 
guttrafficking receptors would likely involve a different reg 
ulatory mechanism. Histone modification by acetylation is 
critical for chromatin remodeling for gene expression in re 
sponse to nuclear hormone receptor ligands (Rosenfeld et al., 
2006). Our results indicate that RAR binding and histone 
acetylation at the CCR9 and Itg4 genes are important for 
expression of the guthoming receptors and are regulated by 
BATF. The detailed interaction underlying the regulation of 
the trafficking receptor genes will require further study as it may 
involve cross talk between BATF and the RAR expression </p>

<p>Figure 10. BATF KO iT reg cells, although 
equally suppressive in vitro as WT iT reg 
cells, are unable to suppress colitis. BATF 
KO and WT iT reg cells were prepared in vitro 
from naive CD4 + T cells through activation 
with concanavalin A in the presence of 
TGF1 and 10 nM RA for 6 d. (A) The 
iT reg cells were examined for their suppres-
sive activity on proliferation of target 
(CD4 + CD25  ) T cells based on frequencies 
(percentages) of CFSE-diluted cells deter-
mined by flow cytometry. (B-E) Rag1 / 
mice were injected i.p. with 0.6 × 10 6 WT 
CD45.1 + naive CD4 + CD25  T cells and 1.2 × 
10 6 WT or BATF KO CD45.2 + iT reg cells, and 
weight change (B), histological changes on 
day 25-28 (C), frequencies of Th1, Th17, and 
FoxP3 + T cells derived from the naive 
CD4 + CD25  T cells (D), and frequencies of 
FoxP3 + cells derived from the injected 
iT reg cells (E) were examined. Bars, 200 µm. 
The mice (n = 9-10/group) were sacrificed 
on day 25-28 after T cell transfer when some 
mice lost &gt;20% of their original weight. 
Pooled data obtained from three experi-
ments are shown in the graphs. All error 
bars are SEM obtained from pooled data. 
Significant differences between indicated 
groups or between WT and BATF KO groups 
are shown (*, P &lt; 0.05). </p>

<p>Short-term homing experiments and confocal analysis to determine 
localization of injected cells. For homing experiments, naive CD4 + T cells 
isolated from splenocytes and LN cells of WT and BATF KO mice were cul 
tured for 5-6 d in complete RPMI 1640 medium (10% FBS) supplemented 
with 2.5 µg/ml concanavalin A, 25 U/ml hIL2, and 10 nM RA. WT cells 
(10 7 cells/mouse; labeled with CFSE; Invitrogen) and BATF KO cells 
(10 7 cells/mouse; labeled with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; Invit 
rogen) were coinjected i.v. into normal C57BL/6 mice. The host mice were 
sacrificed 20 h later, and indicated organs were harvested. The numbers of 
injected CD4 + cells migrated into each organ were determined with flow 
cytometry. Absolute numbers of T cells that migrated into various organs and 
homing index were determined as described previously (Wang et al., 2010). </p>

<p>Confocal and multiphoton microscopy. Spleen, MLN, small intestine, 
colon, and PPs were harvested from 8-10wkold mice and frozen in Tissue 
Tek OCT Compound (Sakura). The tissue blocks were cut into 6µm sections, 
fixed in cold acetone, and stained with combinations of FITC/PE/APC 
conjugated antibodies to CD4 (RM45), cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), and CD8 
(53-6.7). The images were collected with an LSM 710 (Carl Zeiss) or SP5 II 
(Leica) confocal microscope. The 3D images were acquired on paraformal 
dehydefixed wholemounted tissues with an SP5 multiphoton System 
(Leica) with Mai Tai Deep See Tunable IR Laser (IR laser set at 800 nm; fil 
ters were 430-480 for second harmonic generation, 500-595 for CFSE, and 
595-605 for TRITC). Acquisition volume was 300 × 300 × 100 µm, and 
zaxis resolution was 0.5 µm. </p>

<p>T cell population in the intestine after intragastric immunization. 
T reg cell-depleted CD4 + CD25  T cells were isolated from WT OTII and 
BATF KO OTII (CD45.2) mice. The OTII T cells (10 7 cells/mouse) were 
adoptively transferred i.v. into CD45.1 congenic mice. 2 d later, the recipient 
mice were injected with OVA protein (100 mg/injection in 200 µl of PBS; 
SigmaAldrich) intragastrically with a roundtip needle. On the next day, this 
immunization was repeated once. 12 d later, mice were sacrificed to examine 
the numbers of CD4 + FoxP3 + and FoxP3  T cells in indicated organs. </p>

<p>In vitro T reg cell assay. For assessing the T reg cell activity, CFSElabeled 
CD4 + CD25  T cells (target cells, 3 × 10 4 cells/well) and iT reg cells as 
suppressors were cocultured in roundbottom 96well plates for 3 d at the 
indicated ratios with 2 µg/ml antiCD3 antibody and irradiated splenic 
cells (9 × 10 4 cells/well). iT reg cells were generated in vitro with culturing 
CD4 + CD25  naive T cells for 6 d in the presence of 1 ng/ml TGF1, 10 nM 
RA, and 2.5 µg/ml concanavalin A. Dilution of CFSE indicating cell prolif 
eration was determined by flow cytometry. </p>

<p>Induction of colitis in Rag1 / mice and in vivo assessment of 
T reg cell function. For assessment of effector T cell function, Rag1 / mice 
were injected i.p. with 0.6 × 10 6 WT or BATF KO naive T cells. For com 
parison of T reg cell function, 0.6 × 10 6 WT naive T cells were injected together 
with 1.2 × 10 6 WT or BATF KO iT reg cells. Weight change was monitored, 
and the mice were sacrificed on day 25-28 after T cell transfer when some 
mice lost &gt;20% of their original weight. Intestinal inflammation in Rag1 / 
mice was scored as previously described (Wang et al., 2010) based on the de 
gree of leukocyte infiltration, mucosal hyperplasia, and loss of villi on a scale of 
0-4. The histological images were obtained with a widefield DM2000 micro 
scope equipped with a DFC295 color camera (Leica) at 100 magnification. </p>

<p>T cell proliferation in vivo. For assessment of T cell proliferation in vivo, 
10 7 CFSElabeled CD4 + T cells were injected i.v. into Rag1 / mice, and the 
host mice were sacrificed on day 14. For assessment of antigendependent 
T cell proliferation, CD45.1 congenic mice were injected i.v. with 10 7 CFSE 
labeled WT or BATF KO OTII CD4 + T cells and immunized i.p. with 250 µg 
OVA in complete Freund's adjuvant. The host mice were sacrificed 5 d </p>

<p>Cell culture. Single cell suspensions of LNs (mesenteric, inguinal, auxiliary, 
and brachial) and spleens were prepared by grinding tissues through an iron 
mesh. CD4 + T cells were isolated by a CD4 + T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi 
Biotec). The cells were further processed for isolation of T reg cell-depleted 
CD4 + CD25  CD44  CD69  naive T cells with an AutoMACS separator 
(Miltenyi Biotec) as previously described (Kang et al., 2011). The cells were 
cultured for 5-6 d in complete RPMI 1640 medium (10% FBS) supple 
mented with 100 U/ml hIL2. When indicated, 1 ng/ml hTGF1 and/or 
10 nM RA (alltrans RA) was added. As T cell activators, 2.5 µg/ml con 
canavalin A or OVA 323-339 peptide (at 1 µg/ml with 3× irradiated splenocytes 
for OTII cells) was used. All cytokines were obtained from R&amp;D Systems or 
PeproTech. When indicated, HDAC inhibitors such as 10 µM EX527 (Sigma 
Aldrich), 5 nM trichostatin (Enzo Life Sciences), and 10 µM BML210 
(SigmaAldrich) were added to the T cell culture. </p>

<p>Flow cytometry. Expression of chemokine receptors and integrins was 
examined as previously described (Kang et al., 2011). Single cell suspensions, 
isolated from various organs of mice, were stained with antibodies to CCR9 
(clone 242503) and 47 (clone DATK32). For cells stained with unconju 
gated antibodies, biotinlabeled secondary antibodies and tertiary PE/PerCP/ 
APCstreptavidin (BD) were used along with antibodies to CD44 and CD4. 
When necessary, the cells were further stained with antibodies to FoxP3 
(FJK16s; eBioscience) according to the manufacturer's protocol. </p>

<p>Chemotaxis assay. The chemotaxis assay was performed and analyzed as 
described previously (Wang et al., 2010). In brief, 5 × 10 5 T cells, activated 
in the presence or absence of 10 nM RA for 5 d, were added to the upper 
chamber of Transwell inserts (Corning) and allowed to migrate to the 
lower chamber containing 3 µg/ml murine CCL25 (R&amp;D Systems) for 
3 h. The cells in the lower chambers were collected, stained, and quanti 
tated by flow cytometry. </p>

<p>Retroviral expression of BATF. The fulllength and truncated coding 
regions of the mouse BATF cDNA were amplified by PCR using the 
primers described in Table S2. Amplified DNA fragments were cloned into 
a retroviral vector with GFP expression to help identify transduced cells 
(Wang et al., 2009) and sequenced for accuracy. A retrovirus packaging 
cell line (PhoenixECO) was transfected with the vectors, and activated 
T cells were infected with culture supernatant containing the recombinant 
virus. The T cells were previously activated for 36 h with IL2 and con 
canavalin A in the presence or absence of 10 nM RA. The virusinfected 
T cells were harvested 4 d later, and GFP + T cells were examined for CCR9 
and 47 expression. </p>

<p>Bioinformatics and ChIP assays. The <rs type="software">VISTA</rs> bioinformatics tool was 
used to determine conserved noncoding sequences. ChIP assays were per 
formed as described previously (Kang et al., 2011). CD4 + T cells (5 × 10 6 
naive per sample), cultured in the presence of 100 U/ml IL2, 1.5 µg/ml 
concanavalin A, and 10 nM RA for 4-5 d, were used for ChIP assays. DNA 
protein complexes were immunoprecipitated using 4 µg antiBATF (rabbit 
polyclonal; Cell Signaling Technology), antiRAR (rabbit polyclonal; Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and anti-acetylhistone H4 antibodies (EMD 
Millipore). Realtime PCR detection using the primers described in Table S3 
was conducted with a 7500 Sequence Detection System using the SYBR 
green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). </p>

<p>Transfection and reporter assay. Before transfection, T cells were cultured 
with 10 nM RA and 100 U/ml IL2 with platebound 5 µg/ml antiCD3 
and 2 µg/ml antiCD28 for 4 d in complete RPMI medium replaced every 
2 d. Activated CD4 + T cells (5 × 10 6 cells per sample) were transfected with 
20 µg pGL4.15Itg4 (pGL4.1 harboring the 1.3 kbp 5 regulatory region 
of the mouse Itg-4 gene) and 3.5 µg pRL with the Mouse T Cell Nucleo 
fector kit (Lonza). The cells were rested at 37°C for 4-5 h and activated with 
platebound antiCD3, antiCD28, and 100 U/ml IL2 in the presence 100 nM 
RA for 16 h before measurement with the Dual Luciferase Assay System </p>

<p>Abstract Hypotrachyna (Vainio) Hale is a somewhat rare lichen genus found on the Korean Peninsula. Since it was first recorded 
more than two decades ago, no detailed taxonomic or revisionary study of the genus has been conducted. Thus, the present 
study was conducted to carry out a detailed taxonomic and revisionary study of Hypotrachyna in South Korea. This study was 
based on specimens deposited in the Korean Lichen Research Institute (KoLRI). Detailed taxonomic studies and a literature review 
confirmed the presence of seven species of Hypotrachyna from South Korea, including one new record, Hypotrachyna nodakensis 
(Asahina) Hale. Descriptions of each species with their morphological, anatomical and chemical characters together with a key to 
all known Hypotrachyna species are presented. </p>



<p>performed in solvent systems A (toluene:dioxin:acetic acid = 
180:45:5) and C (toluene:acetic acid = 85:15) [13]. All 
examined locations of specimens were mapped using the 
open source GIS software <rs id="software-0" type="software">Quantum GIS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">1.7.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">QGIS</rs>). Voucher 
specimens have been deposited in the herbarium of the 
Lichen and Allied Bio-resource Center at the KoLRI, Sunchon 
National University, South Korea. In the identification key, 
the newly reported species are indicated in bold. </p>

<p>Species description. 
Hypotrachyna nodakensis (Asahina) Hale, Phytologia 28: 
341 (1974). 
Parmelia nodakensis Asahina 1959. 
Thallus foliose, loosely adnate to the substrate, 58 
cm across. Lobes subirregular, 1~5 mm wide; margins 
entire, eciliate apices subrotund. Upper surface pale 
yellowish grey, emaculate, smooth, without phyllidia and 
sorediate, sisidiate. Isidia simple to coralloid branched, 
somewhat brown tipped. Medulla white. Lower surface 
black with brown margin, sparsely rhizinate. Rhizines 
dichotomously branched, black. Apothecia and pycnidia 
not seen (Fig. 1). 
Chemistry: Cortex K+ (yellow), C−, KC−, P−; medulla 
K−, C+ (rose), KC+ (rose to red), P−. TLC: atranorin, 
chloroatranorin, gyrophoric acid, protolichesterinic acid 
(Fig. 2). </p>

<p>Remarks: H. nodakensis is new to South Korea and a 
somewhat rare species. It is characterized by the presence 
of simple to corraloid branched isidia and protolichesterinic 
and gyrophoric acids in the medulla. According to Chen et 
al. [14], H. nodakensis closely resembles H. infirma and H. 
ikomae due to the presence of isidia and fatty acids in the 
medulla. However, it differs from H. infirma by not having 
caperatic and norcaperatic acids in the medulla. H. ikomae 
has the same fatty acids in the medulla as H. nodakensis, 
but lacks gyrophoric acid.

Thallus loosely adnate to the substratum, thin, fragile, 4 
cm across. Lobes sublinear to subirregular, short, ascending 
at the tips, 1~3 mm wide. Upper surface mineral grey, 
smooth, emaculate, becoming pustulate towards the lobe 
tips, pustules becoming sorediate. Medulla white. Lower 
surface black, with brown marginal zone, sparsely rhizinate. 
Rhizines short, dichotomously branched. Apothecia and 
pycnidia not seen (Fig. 1). 
Chemistry: Cortex K+ (yellow), C−, KC−, P−; medulla 
K−, C+ (rose), KC+ (rose to red), P−. TLC: atranorin, 
chloroatranorin, gyrophoric acid, unknown 1 (Fig. 2). 
Remarks: This species is characterized by pustulate 
soredia, revolute lobes and the presence of gyrophoric acid 
in the medulla. According to Divakr and Upreti [12], this 
species is closely related to H. rockii by the nature of its 
soredia and C+ rose medulla, but the latter has a white 
maculate upper surface and evernic and lecanoric acids in 
the medulla.

<p>Species excluded from this study. 
According to earlier publications by different authors, the 
Hypotrachyna taxa listed below have been reported from 
South Korea. Some of these taxa have not been found in 
South Korea or have been synonymized by other taxa. 
However, taxonomic details are provided for the following 
species, Hypotrachyna exsecta (Taylor) Hale, Hypotrachyna 
ikomae (Asahina) Hale, Hypotrachyna physcioides (Nyl.) </p>

<p>Hale and Hypotrachyna pseudosinuosa (Asahina) Hale, 
based on previous literature. </p>

<p>Hypotrachyna exsecta (Taylor) Hale, Phytologia 28: 341 
(1974). 
Parmelia exsecta Taylor, Lond. J. Bot. 6: 166 (1847). 
This species is characterized by pustules that become 
erumpent, eroded and granular-sorediate with age and by 
the presence of atranorin, chloroatranorin and barbatic 
acid in the medulla. This species is closely related to 
Hypotrachyna laevigata, but the latter has wider lobes and 
faint maculae without pustules [11]. 
According to Park [19], H. exsecta was first reported on 
cherry trees in South Korea. In addition to South Korea, 
this species has been reported in Australia [11], India [12], 
Japan [18], North Korea [20], Malaysia [21], and Papua 
New Guinea [22]. </p>

<p>Hypotrachyna ikomae (Asahina) Hale, Phytologia 28: 341 
(1974). 
Parmelia ikomae Ashahina, J. Jpn. Bot. 28: 134 
(1953). 
This species is characterized by broad, sublinear lobes 
with subrotund apices, cylindrical to irregularly thickened 
isidia and the presence of protolichesterinic, lichesterinic, 
nephrosterinic and isonephrosternic acids in the medulla 
[14]. 
H. ikomae was first reported in South Korea by Park 
[19]. This species has also been reported from China [14], 
Japan [23], and Malaysia [24]. </p>

Bot. 25: 54 (1975). 
Parmelia physcioides Nyl., Syn. Meth. Lich. 1: 385 
(1860). 
This species is characterized by a lack of vegetative 
propagules (rarely sparse lobules may be present) and the 
presence of a barbatic acid complex in the medulla. It is 
widely distributed and shows many morphological and 
chemical variations [14]. 
H. physcioides from South Korea was reported by Park 
[25]. This species has also been reported in many 
countries at tropical reagion. </p>

<p>Hypotrachyna pseudosinuosa (Asahina) Hale, Smithson. 
Contrib. Bot. 25: 58 (1975). 
Parmelia pseudosinosa Asahina, J. Jpn. Bot. 26: 329 
(1951). 
According to Chen et al. [14], H. pseudosinuosa is 
characterized by the presence of capitate, subterminal soralia, 
and protocetraric acid in the medulla. 
This species is widespread in panatropical regions 
including Brazil [26], China [14, 15], Costa Rica [27], Japan 
[18], Malaysia [21], Papua New Guinea [28], Taiwan [29], 
and Venezuela [30].

<p>In cancer genome studies, the annotation of newly detected oncogene/tumor suppressor gene candidates is a challenging 
process. We propose using concept lattice analysis for the annotation and interpretation of genes having candidate somatic 
mutations in whole-exome sequencing in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We selected 45 highly mutated genes with 
whole-exome sequencing in 10 normal matched samples of the AML-M2 subtype. To evaluate these genes, we performed 
concept lattice analysis and annotated these genes with existing knowledge databases. </p>

<p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most well-
studied diseases in the genomic research area [1, 2]. AML 
occurs usually in middle-aged people and is diagnosed by 
increasing leukemic myeloblasts in blood over 30% [3]. AML 
is a genetically heterogeneous disease, since 1/3 of AML 
patients have chromosomal rearrangements, like t(8;21) and 
t(15;17), but other AML patients have normal karyotypes 
[4]. With recent advances of high-throughput genomic 
technology, a favorable prognosis has been observed with 
some genetic changes in cytogenetically normal AML [5]. 
These results were reflected by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria; the NMP1 and 
CEBPA mutations were included in the 2008 revision of 
these criteria [6]. The molecular change of AML is con-
sidered to be the accumulation of somatic mutations in 
hematopoietic progenitor cells [7]. Next-generation sequen-
cing technology gave us new insights into the clonal hete-
rogeneity of leukemic mutations so that we can make an 
explanation why some of these mutations are highly re-</p>

<p>producible but others are very rare [8]. Still, in 30% of 
cytogenetically normal AML, the genetic causality origin or 
strongly associated genetic changes have not yet been 
discovered [9, 10]. 
With advances of high-throughput technology, discovery 
of disease-associated genes is growing [11]. As a conse-
quence, the genetic knowledge databases are growing ra-
pidly. Accordingly, the annotation of candidate causal genes 
in genetic studies is a very challenging process for resear-
chers. We propose a workflow of the detection of somatic 
mutation candidates in 10 normal matched AML samples 
and introduce concept lattice analysis for clustering the 
samples that have highly mutated genes in common. </p>

<p>Methods </p>

<p>Primacy sequence analysis </p>

<p>We received the fastq files of whole-exome sequencing 
results of tumor and matched normal sample data of 10 AML 
patients from the Korea Genome Organization in December 
2012. There were no patient-related medical or charac-</p>

<p>teristic data. We aligned the sequencing reads to the human 
reference genome (hg 19, GRCh37) from USCC by <rs id="software-11" type="software">BWA</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-11" type="version-number">0.6.2</rs> [12] (Figs. 1 and 2). To filter the known single nucle-
otide polymorphisms (SNPs), we used dbSNP bulid 137. We 
removed PCR duplicates and filtering low-quality SNPs by 
<rs id="software-8" type="software">Samtools</rs> <rs corresp="#software-8" type="version-number">0.1.18</rs> [13], <rs id="software-9" type="software">Picard</rs> <rs corresp="#software-9" type="version-number">1.68</rs> [14], and <rs id="software-10" type="software">GATK</rs> <rs corresp="#software-10" type="version-number">2.3.4</rs> 
[15]. After the filtering process, the SAM file was converted 
to VCF file by <rs id="software-15" type="software">VCF Tools</rs> <rs corresp="#software-15" type="version-number">0.1.10</rs> [16]. For detecting somatic 
mutation candidates, we obtained the difference in VCF files 
between tumor and normal samples. For annotation of these 
somatic mutation candidates, we used the ANNOVAR tool 
[17]. </p>

<p>Formal concept analysis </p>

<p>We used formal concept analysis (FCA) for the con-
struction of hierarchical relationships among samples 
sharing highly mutated genes [18]. FCA is a useful method 
in conceptual clustering of objects, attributes, and their 
binary relationship. In FCA, the sets of formal objects and 
formal attributes together with their relation to each other 
form a "formal context," which can be represented by a 
crosstable. In our case, the objects are 10 AML samples, and 
the attributes are 45 highly mutated genes. We defined the 
formal context as K = (G, M, I), where G is a set of objects 
(i.e., samples), M is a set of attributes (i.e., mutated genes), 
and I ⊆ G × M is the incidence relations where (g, m) ⊆ I if 
object g has attribute m. For A ⊆ G and B ⊆ M, we define the 
operators A' = {m ∈ M|gIm for all g ∈ A} (i.e., the set of 
attributes common to the objects in A) and B' = {g ∈ G|gIm 
for all m ∈ B} (i.e., the set of objects common to the 
attributes in B). A pair of (A, B) is a formal concept of k(G, 
M, I) if and only if A ⊆ G, B ⊆ M, A' = B, and A = B'. A is 
called the extent and B is the intent of the concept (A, B). The 
extent consists of all objects belonging to the concept while 
the intent contains all attributes shared by the objects. The 
concept of a given context is naturally ordered by the 
subconcept-superconcept relation, defined by (A1, B1) ≤ 
(A2, B2): ＜=＞ A1 ⊆ A2 (＜=＞ B2 ⊆ B1). </p>

<p>The ordered set of all concepts of the context (G, M, I) is 
denoted by C(G, M, I) and is called the concept lattice of (G, 
M, I). We represent the structure of this concept lattice with 
a Hasse diagram, in which nodes are the concepts and the 
edges correspond to the neighborhood relationship among 
the concepts. All concepts above an object label (below the 
attribute label) include that object (attribute). The top 
element of a lattice is a unit concept, representing a concept 
that contains all objects. The bottom element is a zero 
concept having no object. </p>

<p>point mutations include 7,483 synonymous single nucle-

stopgain SNVs, 14 stoploss SNVs, and 5 frameshift sub-
stitutions, and the Indels include 247 frame shift insertions, 
310 frameshift deletions, and 68 nonframe shifts (Fig. 4). 
For each patient, the average nonsynonymous mutation 
count was 429.7 (SD, 97.16). 
About 342 to 665 genes have nonsynonymous somatic 
mutation candidates at least once in each AML sample (Table 
2). Recurrent mutated genes were observed in all samples. </p>

<p>Mutation analysis </p>

<p>The most frequently mutated genes across all samples 
were USP9Y and MUC5B; these genes were mutated in 5 
samples. These genes were also highly mutated in each 
sample; for USP9Y genes, it had 6 nonsynonymous muta-
tions in sample 3. We have selected 45 highly mutated genes 
(1.5%) from 2981 mutated genes. We defined highly mu-
tated genes as genes having 3 or more nonsynonymous 
mutations in each sample (Table 3). In a comparison of 
mutations with the <rs type="software">COSMIC</rs> database [19], among 45 
highly mutated genes, 21 genes matched to hematopoietic 
and lymphoid tissue malignancy terms, and 21 genes 
matched to other cancer types. In 3 genes, there was no 
matched term in <rs type="software">COSMIC</rs> (Table 4). 
We used the concept lattice to construct the hierarchical 
relationship between the samples that had 45 highly 
mutated genes. Concept Biolattice analysis is a mathe-
matical framework based on concept lattice analysis for 
better biological interpretation of genomic data. The top 
element of a lattice is a unit concept, representing a concept 
that contains all objects. The bottom element is a zero 
concept having no object [20, 21]. For comparing with the 
Concept lattice (Fig. 5), we also performed hierarchical 
clustering analysis by Ward method. In hierarchical clus-
tering, cluster 1 has 5 samples (nos. 1, 2, 5, 9, and 10), 
cluster 2 has 2 samples (nos. 4 and 7), and others have 1 
sample each (Fig. 6). We divided the samples into 4 
subgroups by interpretation of the concept lattice result (Fig. 
7). Lattice subgroup 1 shared SYNE1 gene mutation, and 
samples 3, 4, and 7 were included in this subgroup. 
Subgroup 2 was comprised of 5 samples (nos. 1, 2, 5, 6, and 
9) that had MUC5 gene mutations in common. Samples 10 
and 8 could be isolated by the uniqueness of their mutated </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>In this study, we proposed a workflow of matched normal 
AML exome sequencing analysis and the framework for 
defining sample subgroups. We observed every sample 
having a nonsynonymous mutation associated with hema-
tological and lymphoid malignancy genes, but the candidate </p>

<p>oncogenes showed diverse characters. 
We selected 45 genes that had 3 or more nonsynonymous 
mutations and performed hierarchical clustering analysis of 
the samples by these genes. In classic hierarchical clustering 
analysis by Ward's method, we could not identify the genetic 
relationship of those clusters. On the other hand, the result 
of concept lattice analysis gave us insight into the mutational 
pattern of each sample. 
In subgroup 1, samples 3, 4, and 7 shared SYNE1 gene 
mutations. SYNE1 gene encodes a spectrin repeat-con-
taining protein expressed in skeletal and smooth muscle and 
peripheral blood lymphocytes that localizes to the nuclear 
membrane [21]. This gene is not a well-known leukemic 
gene but is observed in some hematological malignancies </p>

<p>and other cancer types [22]. In glioblastoma, SYNE1 muta-
tion is significantly correlated with the overexpression of 
several known glioblastoma survival genes [23]. In the case 
of sample 3, the ITGAX gene, encoding ankyrin repeat 
domain 18A, was mutated. This gene is well known by the 
association with leukemia [24] and lung cancer [25]. For </p>

<p>sample 4, the possible oncogene is LAMC3. LAMC3 gene 
encodes laminins, which are the major non-collagenous 
constituent of basement membrane. LAMC3 mutations are 
associated with several cancers, including colon cancer, lung 
cancer, and melanoma, and candidate tumor suppressor 
genes in bladder transitional cell carcinoma [26]. LAMC3 is </p>

pathway, since it has a role in cell adhesion. The ANKRD18A 
gene is the oncogene candidate for sample 7 and is a novel

is possible that the pair relationship of those genes </p>

<p>(ITGAX-SYNE1, LAMC3-SYNE1, and ANKRD18A-SYNE1) 
could contribute together to evolve the leukemic cell 
transformation. 
The major limitation of our study is that we could not 
validate the mutation results by Sanger method or deep </p>

<p>sequencing. We selected highly mutated genes having 3 
mutations or more, but this definition is arbitrary, so we 
might have lost candidate oncogenes in some patients. 
In this study, we suggest the concept of clustering samples 
that have diverse mutated genes. AML is very heterogeneous 
genetic disease. Despite the small number of samples we 
have studied, the genetic variation patterns were not com-
mon for all samples. It could have been better to evaluate 
more sample data for analysis by clustering analysis. </p>

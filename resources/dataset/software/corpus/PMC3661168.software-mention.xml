<p>Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a cytosolic protein that 
catalyzes the rate-limiting step of human tryptophan (Trp) 
metabolism. Trp depletion induces effector T cells to undergo 
a G 1 cell cycle arrest 
1 and triggers an integrated stress response 
pathway that involves general control nonrepressed 2 (GCN2) 
signaling and eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) phosphory-
lation. 
2,3 IDO also causes systemic anergy by inducing naive </p>

<p>Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) has recently been proposed to account for tumor-induced immunosuppression 
by influencing the conversion of tryptophan (Trp) into kynurenine (Kyn). The objective of our study was to correlate 
IDO activity with disease outcome in non-small cell lung cancer (NscLc) patients treated with multimodal combination 
therapy. In a single-arm phase II trial involving induction gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by concurrent paclitaxel, 
carboplatin and 74 Gy thoracic radiation in stage III NscLc patients, plasma was drawn at baseline, post-induction, 
and post-concurrent therapy. The mean plasma Kyn/Trp ratio was used as a surrogate indicator of IDO activity. The 33 
participants were distributed as follows: 15 females, 18 males; median age = 62; median overall survival (Os) = 22.4 (95% 
cI 19.3-25.1) months; median progression-free survival (pFs) = 11.5 (95% cI 6.7-16.3) months. The mean Kyn/Trp ratio at 
baseline (4.5 ± 2.8) was higher than that of healthy controls (2.9 ± 1.9, p = 0.03) and increased after induction therapy (5.2 
± 3.2, p = 0.08) and chemoradiation (5.8 ± 3.9, p = 0.01). The post-treatment Kyn/Trp ratio and radiologic responses were 
not significantly associated at any time point. No significant correlation was found between baseline Kyn/Trp ratios and 
Os (hR = 1.1, 95% cI 0.45-2.5) or pFs (hR = 0.74, 95% cI 0.30-1.82). a post-induction chemotherapy increase in IDO activity 
portended worse Os (hR = 0.43, 95% cI 0.19-0.95, p = 0.037) and pFs (hR = 0.47, 95% cI 0.22-1.0, p = 0.055). This observed 
increase in IDO transcription may be a means for tumors to evade immunosurveillance. </p>

11,12 Cancer cells bearing mutations in the 
oncosuppressor gene BIN1 are stimulated by interferon γ (IFNγ) 
to overexpress IDO, leading to increased intracellular levels of 
signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and 
nuclear factor κB (NFκB). 
13 Thus, IDO may be an important 
stimulator of immune tolerance in human cancer. 
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an aggressive epithe-
lial malignancy that often overexpresses the mRNA coding for 
IDO. 
14 NSCLC has an annual incidence of 1.61 million people 
worldwide, 
15,16 and 83 percent of NSCLC patients will even-
tually die of their cancer. 
16 Locoregionally-advanced NSCLC 
comprises more than one-third of cases at presentation and is 
classified as Stage III. 
17 Over three quarters of Stage III NSCLC 
patients are technically or medically inoperable. 
18 Chemotherapy 
and concurrent radiation is the standard therapy for inoper-
able Stage III NSCLC, but the five year overall survival (OS) 
remains poor, that is, 20% and 8% for IIIA and IIIB disease, 
respectively. 
19 Such an aggressive malignant phenotype has been 
hypothesized to stem from an innate resistance of NSCLC to 
chemotherapy 
20,21 and to its ability to evade immunosurveil-
lance. 
22,23 However, the role of IDO in mediating immune toler-
ance in NSCLC is unclear. 
Trp catabolism in lung cancer patients is associated with 
advanced disease stage.

8 In fact, IDO is overexpressed by many

immunity. 
10 For example, in humans and animals, the induc-
tion of IDO limits the immune response to dendritic cell-based </p>

<p>ratios at Time 2, with p = 0.19 (Fig. 4B). To index the shift in 
IDO activity after chemotherapy, the differences in Kyn/Trp 
ratios between Time 0 and Time 1 (ΔIDO 1 ) and between Time 1 
and Time 2 (ΔIDO 2 ) were calculated. Participants were subdi-
vided into two groups based on the median ΔIDO value. Using 
RECIST to define the percentage of response, a non-significant 
trend was observed between radiologic responses at Time 1 and 
ΔIDO 1 (Fig. 5). 
Median OS was 22.4 mo (95% CI 19.3-25.1) and median pro-
gression-free survival (PFS) 11.5 mo (95% CI 6.7-16.3) (Table 2). </p>

<p>after chemotherapy or radiation in NSCLC patients is unclear. 
The abrogation of BIN1 causes IDO overexpression and promotes 
NSCLC in animals. 
26 NSCLC-infiltrating lymphocytes are often 
anergic and hypoproliferative, 
27 and the overexpression of IDO 
in the NSCLC peritumoral stroma is associated with poor prog-
nosis. 
28 Based on the these observations, we hypothesized that 
IDO activity may increase in Stage III NSCLC patients undergo-
ing conventional multimodal therapy. Since Kyn is the primary 
metabolite of Trp metabolism, the plasma Kyn/Trp ratio has been 
used as a surrogate indicator of IDO activity. 
29,30 Our objective 
was to prospectively correlate serial changes in IDO activity, as 
measured by the plasma Kyn/Trp ratio, with radiologic response 
and survival in NSCLC patients treated with multimodal therapy. </p>

<p>Results </p>

<p>Forty-three participants were enrolled from December 2003 to 
February 2006. Of 39 participants initiated on treatment, 33 had 
plasma drawn at Time 0 evaluable for mass spectrometry (Fig. 1). 
We observed no trends between baseline plasma metabolites and 
demographic features such as age, race, gender, and performance 
status (Table 1). Moreover, we observed no correlations between 
baseline plasma markers and tumor characteristics such as his-
tology or clinical stage. However, these correlative studies were 
limited by a relatively low statistical power. To assess the presence 
of outliers, we used a formal outlier test, the extreme studentized 
deviate (ESD) method with p &lt; 0.05, which identified one out-
lier at time 0 (14.5 with z = 3.6) and no outliers at Time 1 and 
Time 2. To further assess the influence of outliers, we examined 
the clinicopathologic features of the six participants displaying 
the highest Kyn/Trp ratio at Time 0 and Time 1 compared with 
the rest the cohort. No statistically significant differences in age, 
survival, tumor burden, chemotherapy response, white blood 
count and serum albumin was observed. 
Compared with a sample of 24 healthy controls (2.9 ± 1.9), 
participants had higher mean Kyn/Trp ratio at baseline (4.5 ± 2.8, 
p = 0.03) (Fig. 2). Mean plasma Kyn/Trp ratios increased after 
induction chemotherapy (Time 0 to Time 1, 5.2 ± 3.2, p = 0.08), 
and after concurrent definitive chemoradiation (Time 1 to 
Time 2, 5.8 ± 3.9, p = 0.01). No correlation was observed 
between baseline plasma Kyn/Trp ratios and primary tumor 
cross-sectional area (r = 0.10, 95% CI −0.27-0.43) or total cross-
sectional area of all target lesions on CT (CT) (r = 0.02, 95% 
CI −0.33-0.37) (Fig. 3A). Likewise, no appreciable correlation 
was observed between changes in plasma Kyn/Trp ratios from 
Time 0 to Time 1 (ΔIDO 1 ) and changes in primary tumor cross-
sectional area (r = -0.25, 95% CI −0.56-0.12) or changes in total 
cross-sectional area of all target lesions on CT (r = −0.17, 95% 
CI −0.50-0.20) (Fig. 3B). 
After induction chemotherapy, we observed one complete 
response, 11 partial responses and 21 patients with stable disease. 
Using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST), 
a non-statistically significant association was observed between 
improved radiologic responses and plasma Kyn/Trp ratios at 
Time 1, with p = 0.34 (Fig. 4A). A similar non-significant trend 
was observed between radiologic responses and plasma Kyn/Trp </p>

monitored by α-methyl-tryptophan positron emission tomogra-
phy (PET) imaging as compared with normal tissues. 
39 We could 
not observe a strong correlation between baseline tumor sizes and 
Kyn/Trp ratios, or a strong correlation between changes in tumor 
size and changes in Kyn/Trp ratios. This suggests that Kyn/Trp 
ratios are unlikely to be determined by the tumor burden alone.

<p>24   we did not find a correlation between baseline IDO activity and 
survival. Several authors have examined the relationship between 
IDO activity and survival in other cancers (Table 3). Of inter-
est, studies based on the immunohistochemical detection of IDO 
more often reported an unfavorable role for IDO than stud-
ies based on the detection of IDO mRNA levels (16:1 vs 1:6, </p>

<p>Baseline Kyn/Trp ratios were not significantly associated with OS 
(HR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.41-1.35). After induction chemotherapy 
at Time 1, patients with high ΔIDO 1 had worse OS (p = 0.037) 
and a trend toward worse PFS (p = 0.055) as compared with indi-
viduals with low ΔIDO 1 (Fig. 6). However, no association was 
found after chemoradiation between ΔIDO 2 and OS (HR = 1.1, 
95% CI 0.45-2.5) or PFS (HR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.30-1.82). </p>

<p>To our knowledge, this is the first report to serially explore 
changes in plasma IDO activity during the treatment of Stage III

<p>Fischer's exact p = 0.0003). This difference may reflect a post-
transcriptional regulation of IDO. Our study also examined the 
relationship between changes in IDO activity and disease out-
come. Our results suggest that a high increase in IDO activity 
after chemotherapy is associated with a higher risk of mortal-
ity. A possible explanation for our findings is that the expression 
of IDO by tumor cells may mediate-at least in part-resis-
tance to chemotherapy. 
40 Along these lines, it has recently been 
reported that a subset of NSCLC patients with favorable radio-
logic responses after chemotherapy exhibit a significant decrease 
in IDO activity within monocytes as compared with baseline 
conditions. 
41 Tumors may generate a hostile microenvironment 
that impedes host antitumor immune response. Interestingly, no 
changes in the expression of IDO by tumor cells was observed in 
melanoma biopsies at baseline and during regression in response </p>

42 suggesting that IDO activity 
may not be influenced by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 
(CTLA-4) inhibition. 
Several aspects of our report necessitate a more detailed 
investigation before firm conclusions can be drawn. Due to 
a small sample size, our trial was statistically underpowered 
to detect any significant association between Kyn/Trp ratios 
and demographic characteristics. Likewise, our patient sample 
was too small to establish a stepwise dose-effect relationship 
between IDO activity and clinical outcome. Next, tissues 
were not available for the immunohistochemical detection 
of IDO, so we used plasma Kyn/Trp ratios as a convenient 
surrogate marker for IDO activity. Other studies have used 
plasma Kyn/Trp ratios as an indirect measure for IDO activ-
ity (Table 3) and these correlate well with immunohisto-
chemical data. 
43 However, plasma Kyn/Trp ratios are not 
a direct measure of IDO activity. In particular, other Trp 
catabolizing enzymes, including tryptophan 2,3-dioxygen-
ase and the IDO splice variant known as IDO2 contribute to 
Kyn production as well. Moreover, our study did not mandate 
uniform timing for blood draws. Since plasma Trp levels may 
vary by as much as 20% in the same subject depending on the 
distance of the last meal and the diurnal cycle, 
44 we acknowl-
edge this as a potential confounder. Nonetheless, plasma Kyn 
has only minor diurnal variation, 
43 and the changes that we 
observed in Kyn/Trp ratios appeared predominantly attribut-
able to Kyn (Fig. 2). Another drawback of the present study is 
that correlative immunologic markers, such as FOXP3 expres-
sion, CD3 activity, and IFN production were not measured. 
Additional markers may help to substantiate the putative role 
of IDO in this patient population. Moreover, conclusions 
cannot be drawn about the effect of individual chemotherapy 
agents, which are known to have specific immunomodulatory 
properties. 
45,46 Finally, our calculations were performed with-
out multiple comparison rules. 
47 Thus, the possibility exists 
that the observed associations could stem from family-wise 
errors. In view of all these limitations, our results should be 
strictly viewed as exploratory. 
In summary, our findings may serve as a rationale for 
larger studies correlating changes in the Kyn/Trp ratio with 
clinical parameters during standard multimodal therapy 
against NSCLC. As IDO may contribute to the resistance of 
NSCLC to therapy, this clinical setting may be a fertile area for 
the investigation of the antineoplastic effects of IDO inhibitors, 
such as1-methyl-D-tryptophan (D-1MT). </p>

<p>individual mean concentrations were recorded. The intraassay 
and day-to-day analytic coefficients of variation were less than 
5% for each analyte (Table S1). 
Statistics. The plasma concentrations of Kyn and Trp, as 
well as Kyn/Trp ratios approximated a parametric distribution. 
Therefore, data were presented as means ± SD. Due to the small 
sample size, the associations between serum biomarker levels and 
clinicopathologic variables were evaluated with Wilcoxon rank-
sum and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Wilcoxon signed rank was used to 
compare between time points. Correlation was estimated using 
Spearman's rho. Survival curves were calculated according to the 
Kaplan-Meier method. To address the experimental hypothesis, 
the statistical population was equally divided into "hig" and 
"low" patients using the median Kyn/Trp value as pre-specified 
cut-point. The effects of biomarkers on PFS and OS were evalu-
ated using log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test and Cox proportional-
hazards regression models. All tests performed were two-tailed. 
Statistical analysis was performed using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> software (version 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">8.0</rs>). Figures and survival plots were generated using <rs id="software-1" type="software">GraphPad Prism</rs> 
® (version <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">5.04</rs>). </p>

<p>evaluated all scans. OS was defined as the interval between the 
date of treatment and the date of death. PFS was defined as the 
interval between the date of treatment and the date of progres-
sion or death from any cause. Participants without an event were 
censored as of the date of last follow-up, which occurred between 
August and September 2009. 
All procedures were approved by the Institution Review Board 
(IRB) from the University of South Florida (FWA00001669) 
and were in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. 
Participants prospectively provided informed consent for the use 
of their tissue in research. 
Measurement of plasma markers. Heparinized blood 
samples were drawn and centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min to 
extract plasma and then stored at −80°C. HPLC/MS/MS was 
performed with gradient elution on a C18 column (Thermo 
Betabasic, 150 mm × 2.1 mm, 5 μm particles) with matching 
guard column at a flow rate of 500 μL/min using heated elec-
trospray ionization in the positive ion mode. 
50 Gradient solvents 
were 0.1% formic acid in water and acetonitrile with 0.1% for-
mic acid (HPLC grade, Fisher-Scientific). The mass spectrometer 
(TSQ Quantum Ultra, Thermo) was operated in selected reac-
tion monitoring mode (SRM). Calibration standards for Trp and 
Kyn (Fisher-Scientific) were prepared in albumin (Sigma) in the 
ranges of 10-2,000 ng/mL for Kyn and 100-20,000 ng/mL for 
Trp. Quality control samples were prepared in albumin at 10, 
100, 1000 ng/mL for Kyn and 100, 1,000, 10,000 ng/mL for 
Trp. 150 μL of internal standard solution containing Trp-d3 at 
4,000 ng/mL and Kyn-d6 at 400 ng/mL (Cambridge Isotopes) 
were added and mixed to 150 μL of calibration standard, quality 
control, and clinical specimens. For protein precipitation, 30 μL 
of 2.4 M perchloric acid (Fisher-Scientific) were added, samples 
were vortexed and cooled for 5 min, then centrifuged at 20,400 
g for 20 min. The supernatant was transferred to a filter tube 
(0.44 μm) and re-centrifuged. The filtered sample was trans-
ferred to a glass vial with 400 μL insert and 10 μL was injected 
onto the column. Each sample was performed in triplicate, and </p>

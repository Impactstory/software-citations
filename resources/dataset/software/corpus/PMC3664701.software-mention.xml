<p>Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ), which constitutes 1% of the plasma membrane phospholipid, 
plays a key role in membrane-delimited signaling. PIP 2 regulates structurally and functionally diverse membrane 
proteins, including voltage-and ligand-gated ion channels, inwardly rectifying ion channels, transporters, and re-
ceptors. In some cases, the regulation is known to involve specific lipid-protein interactions, but the mechanisms 
by which PIP 2 regulates many of its various targets remain to be fully elucidated. Because many PIP 2 targets are 
membrane-spanning proteins, we explored whether the phosphoinositides might alter bilayer physical properties 
such as curvature and elasticity, which would alter the equilibrium between membrane protein conformational 
states-and thereby protein function. Taking advantage of the gramicidin A (gA) channels' sensitivity to changes 
in lipid bilayer properties, we used gA-based fluorescence quenching and single-channel assays to examine the 
effects of long-chain PIP 2 s (brain PIP 2 , which is predominantly 1-stearyl-2-arachidonyl-PIP 2 , and dioleoyl-PIP 2 ) on 
bilayer properties. When premixed with dioleoyl-phosphocholine at 2 mol %, both long-chain PIP 2 s produced 
similar changes in gA channel function (bilayer properties); when applied through the aqueous solution, however, 
brain PIP 2 was a more potent modifier than dioleoyl-PIP 2 . Given the widespread use of short-chain dioctanoyl-
phosphoinositides, we also examined the effects of diC 8 -phosphoinositol (PI), PI(4,5)P 2 , PI(3,5)P 2 , PI(3,4)P 2 , and 
PI(3,4,5)P 3 . The diC 8 phosphoinositides, except for PI(3,5)P 2 , altered bilayer properties with potencies that de-
creased with increasing head group charge. Nonphosphoinositide diC 8 phospholipids generally were more potent 
bilayer modifiers than the polyphosphoinositides. These results show that physiological increases or decreases in 
plasma membrane PIP 2 levels, as a result of activation of PI kinases or phosphatases, are likely to alter lipid bilayer 
properties, in addition to any other effects they may have. The results further show that exogenous PIP 2 , as well as 
structural analogues that differ in acyl chain length or phosphorylation state, alters lipid bilayer properties at the 
concentrations used in many cell physiological experiments . </p>



<p>Phosphoinositides alter lipid bilayer properties </p>

<p>analogues alter bilayer properties and, if so, to parse out 
which bilayer properties are affected. 
Many different probes have been used to character-
ize the changes in bilayer properties that are caused by 
drugs and other amphiphiles (Seddon et al., 2009). For 
the present studies, we used gramicidin A (gA) channels 
as probes that serve as prototypical bilayer-spanning 
proteins, which experience minimal interference from 
specific lipid-protein interactions. gA channels form by 
the transmembrane dimerization of nonconducting mo-
nomeric subunits residing in apposing bilayer leaflets 
(O'Connell et al., 1990). Channel formation is associated 
with a local bilayer compression (Elliott et al., 1983; 
Huang, 1986; Harroun et al., 1999), which makes gA 
channels sensitive to changes in bilayer properties 
(Andersen et al., 2007; Lundbaek et al., 2010a,b). 
Using gA channels as probes, we have explored the 
effects of phosphoinositides on lipid bilayers while vary-
ing the method by which membrane PIP 2 was manipu-
lated, the acyl chain composition, and the number and 
posi tions of phosphate groups on the inositol ring (Fig. 1). 
For comparison, we also examined the bilayer-perturbing 
effects of other related short-chain phospholipids. 
Our results show that increasing or decreasing the 
mole percentage of long-chain PIP 2 in the plasma mem-
brane results in altered lipid bilayer properties. Both 
long-and short-chain phosphoinositides, as well as non-
phosphoinositide short-chain phospholipids, are bilay er-
modifying agents. </p>

<p>Materials 
All phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., ex-
cept for diC 8 PI (1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoinositol), which 
was purchased from Echelon Biosciences (Fig. 1). The diC 8 phospho-
lipid stock solutions were 5 mM in water, except for the diC 8 PE 
stock solution, which was 5 mM in ethanol (Pharmco-AAPER). 
The long-chain PIP 2 s were 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-
(1-myo-inositol-4,5-bisphosphate) and the porcine brain extract 
of PIP 2 , which is 80% C 18/20:4 PIP 2 . To make aqueous "solutions" 
of diC 18:1 and brain PIP 2 , the powder was suspended in H 2 O. The 
suspension was sonicated in an ultrasonic homogenizer (model 
300 V/T; Biologics Inc.) for 30 min on ice at 90% power and 90% 
duty cycle using 1-s pulses. The resuspended long-chain phos-
phoinositides were flash frozen and stored at 40°C in a glass vial. 
To make DC 18:1 PC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine)/ 
PIP 2 lipid mixtures, the long-chain PIP 2 was dissolved in chloro-
form (Honeywell Burdick and Jackson) and mixed with DC 18:1 PC 
in chloroform at the appropriate mole percentage. Chloroform was 
evaporated under N 2 , and the mixture was suspended in n-decane 
(Sigma-Aldrich). 8-Aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (ANTS) 
was purchased from Invitrogen. For the single-channel experi-
ments, we used a 15-amino acid analogue, [Ala </p>

chain-shortened 13-amino acid gA analogue of opposite helix

in which the NH groups on the four Trp residues are methylated, 
[Val

9,11,13,15 ]gA (N-Me-gA(15)); they were synthesized 
and purified as described previously (Greathouse et al., 1999). For 
the fluorescence assay, we used the natural mixture of gramicidins </p>

(Wang and Richards, 2012). Given the lack of a clear 
mechanism for many of the PIP 2 -mediated effects, it thus 
becomes important to explore whether changes in ex-
tant, or exogenously applied, PIP 2 s alter bilayer properties 
at relevant concentrations, in which case some of PIP 2 's 
effects may be caused by nonspecific bilayer-mediated 
mechanisms, as recently was proposed in the case of inver-
tebrate phototransduction (Hardie and Franze, 2012). 
Bilayer-spanning proteins are energetically coupled 
to the host lipid bilayer through hydrophobic interac-
tions between the transmembrane domains and the lipid 
bilayer hydrophobic core, which can influence the lipid 
packing around the protein (Killian et al., 1989, 1996) 
or the protein conformation (Keller et al., 1993; Brown, 
1994; Greathouse et al., 1994). This lipid reorganization 
(bilayer deformation) has an associated energetic cost, 
the bilayer deformation energy (G def ). If protein con-

is given that G def will change, but the changes may or 
may not be sufficient to cause measurable changes in 
protein function.) We therefore set out to determine 
whether PIP 2 and its structural analogues alter bilayer 
properties and, if so, to parse out which bilayer proper-
ties are affected. 
Many different probes have been used to characterize 
the changes in bilayer properties that are caused by

formation is associated with a local bilayer compression 
(Elliott et al., 1983; Huang, 1986; Harroun et al., 1999), 
which makes gA channels sensitive to changes in bilayer 
properties (Andersen et al., 2007; Lundbaek et al., 
2010a,b). 
Using gA channels as probes, we have explored the 
effects of phosphoinositides on lipid bilayers while vary-
ing the method by which membrane PIP 2 was manipu-
lated, the acyl chain composition, and the number and 
positions of phosphate groups on the inositol ring (Fig. 
1). For comparison, we also examined the bilayer-per-
turbing effects of other related short-chain 
phospholipids. 
Our results show that increasing or decreasing the 
mole percentage of long-chain PIP 2 in the plasma mem-
brane results in altered lipid bilayer properties. Both 
long-and short-chain phosphoinositides, as well as non-
phosphoinositide short-chain phospholipids, are bi-
layer-modifying agents. </p>

Given the lack of a clear mechanism for many of the

thereby altering the bilayer response to a deformation

<p>Electrophysiology 
Planar lipid bilayers were formed across a 1.5-mm-diameter aper-
ture in a Teflon partition using DC 18:1 PC or DC 18:1 PC-long-chain 
PIP 2 suspensions in n-decane. The total phospholipid concentra-
tion was the same (15 mg/ml) in the pure and mixed lipid suspen-
sions. The aqueous solution was a 1 M NaCl and 10 mM HEPES, 
pH 7.0, solution; the temperature was 25 ± 1°C. Single-channel 
measurements were performed at 200 mV using a patch clamp am-
plifier (model 3900A; Dagan Corp.) and the bilayer punch method 
(Andersen, 1983). The current signal was filtered at 5 kHz, sam-
pled at 20 kHz, and digitally filtered at 500 Hz. After the bilayer was 
formed, gA analogues of different lengths and helix senses were 
added to both sides of the bilayer, and the solutions were stirred 
for 5 min (in a few experiments, only N-Me-gA(15) was added). 
After 30 min, to allow for gA incorporation, control current 
traces were recorded. In the experiments in which the lipids were 
added through the aqueous phase, short-or long-chain phospho-
lipids were added to both sides of the bilayer. The solutions were 
stirred for 1 min and equilibrated for 10 min before recording. 
Single-channel current transitions were identified using the al-
gorithm described previously (Andersen, 1983), implemented in 
software written in <rs id="software-0" type="software">Visual Basic</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Microsoft Corp.</rs>.). Single-channel 
lifetimes () were determined by fitting single exponential distribu-
tions to survivor histograms of the lifetime distributions using <rs id="software-1" type="software">Origin</rs> 
<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">6.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">OriginLab</rs>). At least 300 channels were collected in each ex-
periment. Changes in appearance frequency ( f ), the number of 
channels (opening followed by closing events) per unit of time, were 
determined only in experiments in which the bilayer remained in-
tact after adding the phospholipid. The results were reported as 
means ± SD; in case there were only two observations, the results 
were reported as means ± range. Relative changes in appearance 
frequency were determined by normalizing the appearance fre-
quency in the first two recordings right after the 10-min incubation </p>

<p>Figure 1. Structures of the phospholipids used in this study; brain PIP 2 is predominantly 1-C 18:0 -2-C 20:4 -PI(4,5)P 2 , which is shown in 
the figure. </p>



<p>Phosphoinositides alter lipid bilayer properties </p>

<p>Additional information can be obtained through simultaneous 
measurements on two gA channels of different lengths (with dif-
ferent hydrophobic mismatch and helix sense, to prevent the for-
mation of heterodimers), which allows for distinguishing between 
effects on bilayer curvature and elasticity. This is possible because, 
according to Eqs. 2 and 3, if the bilayer elasticity (expressed as 
changes in H B ) is altered, the effects will be hydrophobic mismatch 
dependent, with greater changes in the shorter channel's appear-
ance frequency and lifetime (Lundbaek et al., 2005; Rusinova et al., 
2011). If the relative changes in lifetime are similar for the longer 
and shorter channels, curvature effects dominate (Artigas et al., 
2006; Ashrafuzzaman et al., 2006). </p>

<p>Fluorescence-based gA assay 
To assay for the phosphoinositides' bilayer-modifying effects, we 
used a gramicidin-based fluorescence quench assay (Ingólfsson 
and Andersen, 2010; Ingólfsson et al., 2010; Rusinova et al., 2011) 
in which fluorophore-loaded lipid vesicles were mixed with a 
gramicidin-permeable fluorescence quencher (Tl 
+ ) such that 
changes in gramicidin channel activity (the number of channels 
in the large unilamellar vesicle [LUV] membrane) were moni-
tored as changes in the rate of fluorescence quenching. In brief, 
after solvent evaporation, DC 22:1 PC (1,2-dierucoyl-sn-glycero-3-
phosphocholine) was rehydrated in 100 mM NaNO 3 , 25 mM ANTS, 
and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7. After vesicle extrusion and desalting 
to remove excess ANTS, the ANTS-loaded LUVs were prepared 
for fluorescent experiments by diluting 1:20 in 140 mM NaNO 3 
and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7. ANTS-loaded LUVs were doped with 
gD; after incubation for 24 h at 12.5°C to allow for bilayer incor-
poration of gD, the LUVs were incubated at 25°C with or with-
out (control) the test phospholipid for 10 min (unless otherwise 
noted). The LUVs and the Tl 
+ -containing quench buffer were 
mixed in a stopped-flow spectrometer (SX.20; Applied Photo-
physics) with a dead time of &lt;2 ms, and the time course of the 
ANTS fluorescence signal was recorded (see Figs. 8 A and 9 A). 
The resulting fluorescence quench curves were fit with a stretched

frequencies. These experiments were performed using 
gA analogues of different chirality and length, gA

In addition to altering the single-channel lifetimes, the 
long-chain PIP 2 s caused flickering channel appearances 
(Fig. 2), with no change in the current through the fully 
conducting state. The flickers appear as rapid transi-
tions into and out of one or more subconductance states, 
meaning that they reflect partial pore block rather than 
gA dimer dissociation. We do not understand how the 
long-chain PIP 2 s cause these conductance transitions, but 
they are unlikely to result from interactions between the 
indole NH groups and phosphate oxygens in the inositol 
bisphosphate head groups (Kim et al., 2012), as 2 mol %

<p> can be understood by noting that the bilayer needs to 
thin by &gt;1 nm to reach the transition state for channel 
formation, whereas the two subunits need to move apart 
by only a small distance to reach the transition state for 
channel dissociation (Greisen et al., 2011).

diC 18:1 PIP 2 had no effect on f or  for either channel type 
(Figs. 5; 6, A and C; and 7, A and B). 
Both diC 8 and brain PIP 2 increased the single-channel

trations, the lifetime increases relative to control were

<p>Phosphoinositides alter lipid bilayer properties </p>

<p>quench rate reflect changes in the Tl 
+ influx and channel 
activity (Ingólfsson and Andersen, 2010; Ingólfsson et al., 
2010). The gA dimerization constant varies with changes 
in lipid bilayer properties (Andersen and Koeppe, 2007; 
Lundbaek et al., 2010a), meaning that one can attribute 
the changes in quench rate after amphiphile addition 
to modulation of bilayer properties, which in turn gov-
ern the gramicidin monomer↔dimer equilibrium and 
thus the number of channels in the LUV membrane 
(Ingólfsson and Andersen, 2010; Rusinova et al., 2011). 
Brain PIP 2 and diC 8 PIP 2 increased the fluorescence 
quench rates, whereas diC 18:1 PIP 2 did not alter the quench 
rates at the tested concentrations (Fig. 8). The results 
in Fig. 8 are consistent with the electrophysiological </p>

<p>the relative changes in single-channel appearance fre-
quencies, f, and lifetimes, , elicited by either PIP 2 spe-
cies were not significantly different for the longer AgA(15) 
and the shorter gA 
 (13) channels, which would suggest 
that they primarily alter intrinsic curvature, the aggre-
gate results suggest that they also increase bilayer elas-
ticity (Lundbaek et al., 2010b; Rusinova et al., 2011). </p>

ing of diC 18:1 or brain PIP 2 into the bilayer, as compared 
with the shorter diC 8 PIP 2 , the dose-response curves for 
diC 18:1 or brain PIP 2 were right shifted compared with 
those of their diC 8 counterpart. </p>

<p>Short-chain phosphoinositides </p>

<p>The short-chain (diC 8 ) phosphoinositides are relatively 
water soluble, with critical micelle concentrations (CMCs) 
in the high micromolar range (Table 1), which makes 
them easy to handle in functional assays. We therefore 
examined the bilayer-modifying effects of diC 8 phos-
phoinositides with different numbers and positions of 
the phosphate groups on the inositol ring using the fluo-
rescence quench method. 
All of the diC 8 phosphoinositides increased gramicidin 
channel activity, as reflected by the increased quench </p>

<p>results (Figs. 5-7), yet the different bilayer-modifying 
potencies of diC 18:1 PIP 2 and brain PIP 2 are surprising 
because bilayer partition coefficients of fatty acids in-
crease with increasing acyl chain saturation (Yokoyama 
and Nakagaki, 1993; Richieri et al., 1999). One would 
expect that the same would apply for diC 18:1 PIP 2 , com-
pared with its polyunsaturated counterpart brain PIP 2 that 
mostly is C 18:0/20:4 PIP 2 . It is not clear, however, whether 
this reasoning should apply to situations in which the 
PIP 2 s are micellar because the free energy of transfer be-
tween micelles and bilayers is likely to be modest (Bullock 
and Cohen, 1986; Heerklotz and Seelig, 2000). The obser-
vation that brain PIP 2 was more effective than diC 18:1 PIP 2 
thus suggests that the exchange between micelles and 
the bilayer is slower for diC 18:1 PIP 2 than for brain PIP 2 . 
Nevertheless, longer incubation times of vesicles with 
either long-chain PIP 2 did not alter the quench rates. 
(The relative changes in quench rates observed with 
50 µM brain PIP 2 were 2.7 ± 1 vs. 3.1 ± 1.0; with 50 µM </p>

<p>because bilayer partition coefficients of fatty acids in-
crease with increasing acyl chain saturation (Yokoyama 
and Nakagaki, 1993; Richieri et al., 1999). One would 
expect that the same would apply for diC 18:1 PIP 2 , com-
pared with its polyunsaturated counterpart brain PIP 2 
that mostly is C 18:0/20:4 PIP 2 . It is not clear, however, 
whether this reasoning should apply to situations in 
which the PIP 2 s are micellar because the free energy of 
transfer between micelles and bilayers is likely to be 
modest (Bullock and Cohen, 1986; Heerklotz and 
Seelig, 2000). The observation that brain PIP 2 was more 
effective than diC 18:1 PIP 2 thus suggests that the ex-
change between micelles and the bilayer is slower for 
diC 18:1 PIP 2 than for brain PIP 2 . Nevertheless, longer in-
cubation times of vesicles with either long-chain PIP 2 
did not alter the quench rates. (The relative changes in 
quench rates observed with 50 µM brain PIP 2 were 2.7 ± </p>

<p>quench rate reflect changes in the Tl 
+ influx and chan-
nel activity (Ingólfsson and Andersen, 2010; Ingólfsson 
et al., 2010). The gA dimerization constant varies with 
changes in lipid bilayer properties (Andersen and Ko-
eppe, 2007; Lundbaek et al., 2010a), meaning that one 
can attribute the changes in quench rate after amphi-
phile addition to modulation of bilayer properties, 
which in turn govern the gramicidin monomer↔dimer 
equilibrium and thus the number of channels in the 
LUV membrane (Ingólfsson and Andersen, 2010; 
Rusinova et al., 2011). 
Brain PIP 2 and diC 8 PIP 2 increased the fluorescence 
quench rates, whereas diC 18:1 PIP 2 did not alter the 
quench rates at the tested concentrations (Fig. 8). The 
results in Fig. 8 are consistent with the electrophysiolog-
ical results (Figs. 5-7), yet the different bilayer-modify-
ing potencies of diC 18:1 PIP 2 and brain PIP 2 are surprising </p>

<p>Phosphoinositides alter lipid bilayer properties </p>

<p>Schwarzenbach, 1995; Avdeef, 2001; Seydel and Wiese, 
2002). Based on the estimated mole percentage of each 
phospholipid in the LUV membranes (Table 1) and the 
dose-response curves (Fig. 10), the zwitterionic diC 8 PC 
and -PE have similar bilayer-modifying potencies, whereas 
the anionic diC 8 PI and -PS are more potent. </p>

<p>Single-channel electrophysiology. The short-chain diC 8 PC 
(1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), -PE, -PS, 
and -PI vary also in their effects on planar bilayers, with 
diC 8 PS and diC 8 PE eliciting the largest channel life-
time increases, and diC 8 PC causing the least change 
(Fig. 11 A). 
Although the changes are small, the linear relation-
ship between the natural logarithm of the AgA(15) and 
gA 
 (13) single-channel lifetimes, in the presence of 
diC 8 phospholipids, has a slope of 1.16 ± 0.05, R = 0.994 
(Fig. 11 D), suggesting that they do increase bilayer 
elasticity (Lundbaek et al., 2010b), in addition to chang-
ing the curvature (Rusinova et al., 2011). Except for 
the effects of diC 8 PS on AgA(15) channels, the relative 
changes in f (Fig. 11 B) were larger than the changes in 
. At the highest concentration tested, none of the 
phospholipids (whether anionic or zwitterionic) altered 
the gA single-channel current transition amplitudes. 
That the anionic phospholipids do not alter the single-
channel current transition amplitudes is in striking con-
trast to the results obtained with free fatty acids (Bruno 
et al., 2007, 2013). </p>

<p>The mechanisms by which phosphoinositides alter mem-
brane protein function remain enigmatic in the sense 
that, for many proteins, it is unclear to what extent the </p>

<p>rate, with PI being the most active and PI(3,4,5)P 3 and 
PI(3,5)P 2 the least bilayer active: PI &gt; PI(4,5)P 2 = PI(3,4) 
P 2 &gt; PI(3,4,5)P 3 ≥ PI(3,5)P 2 (Fig. 9). 
The concentrations at which we observed changes in 
bilayer properties varied from 10 µM for PI, PI(3,4)P 2 , 
and PI(4,5)P 2 to 150 µM for PI(3,5)P 2 and PI(3,4,5)P 2 . 
Overall, the potency decreased with increasing head 
group charge (compare with Fig. 1), as would be expected 
if the short-chain phosphoinositides' bilayer-modifying 
potencies depended on their ability to partition into the 
bilayer-solution interface. Though the formal charge on 
PI(3,5)P 2 is the same as that on PI(4,5)P 2 and PI(3,4)P 2 , 
its bilayer-modifying potency was less than that of 
PI(3,4,5)P 3 , suggesting that the phosphate configura-
tion around the inositol ring modulates the interac-
tion with the bilayer. Unlike the adjacent phosphates in 
PI(3,4)P 2 or PI(4,5)P 2 , the distant phosphates in 
PI(3,5)P 2 may prevent the phosphoinositol ring from 
inserting as far into the bilayer (Redfern and Gericke, 
2005), resulting in weaker bilayer effects. </p>

<p>Other short-chain phospholipids </p>

<p>Fluorescence quench studies. For comparison with the 
short-chain phosphoinositides, we examined other short-
chain phospholipids-diC 8 PS (1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycero-
3-phospho-l-serine), -PE, and -PC. All three alter lipid 
bilayer properties with similar dose-response curves 
(Fig. 10); they have similar bilayer-modifying potencies 
even though their head groups vary in size and charge. 
The bilayer partition coefficients of surfactants can be 
estimated from their CMCs (Bullock and Cohen, 1986; 
Heerklotz and Seelig, 2000). (In case CMCs are not avail-
able, the partition coefficient of a neutral amphiphile 
can be estimated from the logarithms of the calculated 
water/octanol partitioning ratio (clogP; Escher and </p>

<p>The aqueous phospholipid concentrations and their surface densities and mole percentage in the membrane ([PL] a , {PL} m , and mole % PL , respectively) 
were calculated according to Bruno et al. (2007) and Rusinova et al. (2011) using 1.2/CMC as an estimate for the (dimensionless) partition coefficient 
into the membrane (Bullock and Cohen, 1986); the total phospholipid concentration in the membrane was taken to be 1.2 M. This may overestimate the 
partition coefficient and mole % PL , as Heerklotz and Seelig (2000) found the partition coefficient for diC 7 PC to be threefold less than predicted using the 
above estimator. (The difference between the mole fractions in the LUVs vs. the planar bilayer is a result of the different amount of lipids in the different 
systems.) </p>

for an integral membrane protein may be larger 
or smaller, depending on the protein radius, shape, and 
the host bilayer material properties.) Both long-and short-
chain polyphosphoinositides have little effect on bilayer 
properties at 3 µM (nominal concentration; Figs. 7 and 9), 
meaning that functional effects of long-chain polyphos-
phoinositides that occur at or below the micromolar 
range are unlikely to be bilayer mediated. In contrast, </p>

<p>phosphoinositides act through direct binding to their 
membrane protein effectors, as opposed to altering lipid 
bilayer properties or some other indirect mechanism that 
in turn will alter the energetics of protein conforma-
tional transitions. We used gramicidin-based fluores-
cence quenching and single-channel assays to determine 
whether various polyphosphoinositide isoforms alter 
lipid bilayer properties and found that they do so at 
physiologically relevant concentrations (mole fractions 
in the membrane). 
First, we highlight that bilayer modulation by PIP 2 oc-
curs at "relevant" concentrations and consider what bi-
layer properties are affected. Next, we discuss implications 
of our findings in view of what is known about PIP 2 and 
its mechanism of action. Finally, we discuss and com-
pare the bilayer-modifying effects of PIP 2 to those of 
isoforms with different phosphate group organizations 
as well as acyl chain variants and other phospholipids. </p>

<p>Phosphoinositides alter lipid bilayer properties </p>

<p>2005; Li et al., 2005; Hilgemann, 2007), and PIP 2 alters 
gramicidin channel stability at 2 mol % (Fig. 2). Thus, 
physiological depletion or enrichment of PIP 2 in the inner 
leaflet of the plasma membrane (Nasuhoglu et al., 2002; 
Xu et al., 2003; Horowitz et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005; Suh 
and Hille, 2005), whether global or local, is likely to be 
associated with changes in lipid bilayer properties. 
Local PIP 2 enrichment may be considerable, as there 
are 70-80 phospholipids in the first two lipid shells around 
a bilayer-spanning protein of 3-nm radius. If one PIP 2 
molecule is required to alter protein function, the local 
PIP 2 mole percentage would be 1; if four PIP 2 s were 
needed, the mole percentage would be ≥5! PIP 2 bind-
ing to its target proteins thus may alter the local bilayer 
environment (the bilayer material properties), and the 
question becomes, what are the relative energetic con-
tributions of specific binding and nonspecific bilayer-
mediated effects on protein function? 
Whether bilayer-mediated effects become important 
will depend on the affinity of PIP 2 (or other ligands) for 
the protein. Some ion channels are regulated at very 
low PIP 2 concentrations, whereas other PIP 2 targets re-
quire higher concentrations, as reflected in their regu-
lation by physiological stimulation of PIP 2 hydrolysis 
(Huang et al., 1998; Kobrinsky et al., 2000; Runnels et al., 
2002; Lopes et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2003; Rohács et al., 
2005; Rohács, 2007). In the case of Kir channels, the PIP 2 
affinity is inversely correlated with the channels' suscep-
tibility to regulation by PIP 2 isomers and other mole-
cules (Zhang et al., 1999; Schulze et al., 2003; Lee et al., 
2005; Rosenhouse-Dantsker and Logothetis, 2007). Thus, 
channels with lower affinity for PIP 2 are likely to be more 
sensitive to their environment, in which case dynamic 
changes in the environment (including PIP 2 -induced 
changes in bilayer properties) may be important for 
function. These features may be tested by exposing the 
channels to short-chain nonphosphoinositide phospho-
lipids, which modify the bilayer (Fig. 11 C) and thus allow 
for a positive control of sensitivity to changes in lipid 
bilayer properties. </p>

<p>Bilayer-modifying effects of different polyphosphoinositide 
isoforms and short-chain phospholipids </p>

<p>Results obtained using the gramicidin-based fluores-
cence assay show that all compounds tested increase the 
ANTS fluorescence quench rates because they shift the 
gA monomer↔dimer equilibrium toward the conduct-
ing dimers, indicating that each of them alters lipid bi-
layer properties, albeit with different potencies. 
A compound's apparent bilayer-modifying potency re-
flects several factors: its affinity for the bilayer (its partition 
coefficient), which relates the concentration of mono-
disperse molecules in solution to the surface density or 
volume concentration in the bilayer; the state of the com-
pound in solution, where micelle or other aggregate 
formation will influence the number of monomeric </p>

<p>effects that are observed only at concentrations ≥10 µM 
may, at least in part, be caused by altered bilayer proper-
ties. Many studies have used much higher [diC 8 PIP 2 ] 
(Runnels et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2003; Lopes et al., 
2005; Rohács et al., 2005; Hernandez et al., 2008), in 
which case it becomes important to consider the possi-
bility of membrane effects. </p>

<p>Implications for PIP 2 targets </p>

<p>PIP 2 -sensitive channels vary considerably in their phos-
phate isomer specificity (Fan and Makielski, 1997; Rohács 
et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2003; Rohács, 2007), and the 
binding pockets in PIP 2 -binding membrane-spanning 
proteins vary greatly, meaning that the definition of bind-
ing sites for PIP 2 becomes ambiguous (Suh and Hille, 
2008). Other than requirements for positive and aro-
matic residues, the binding sites are not clearly defined 
(Rosenhouse-Dantsker and Logothetis, 2007; Suh and 
Hille, 2008), however, and mutations of specific residues, 
or even entire polybasic regions, may modulate but not 
eliminate the PIP 2 effects (Rohács et al., 2003; Zhang 
et al., 2003; Rohács, 2007; Vaithianathan et al., 2008). 
These ambiguities suggest that some PIP 2 effects may be 
the result of less specific interactions, such as altered en-
ergetic coupling between the target protein and the host 
bilayer. Indeed, nonphosphoinositide phospholipids can 
alter channel function if applied at high concentrations 
from 0.01 to 1 mM (Fan and Makielski, 1997; Kim and 
Bang, 1999; Hilgemann et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2003; 
Vaithianathan et al., 2008). Importantly, the PIP 2 abun-
dance percentage in the inner leaflet of the plasma mem-
brane is on the order of 1%, perhaps higher (Ferrell and 
Huestis, 1984; Balla and Várnai, 2002; Nasuhoglu et al., 
2002; Wenk et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2003; Horowitz et al., </p>

<p>bilayer-modifying potency (Lundbaek et al., 1997; see 
also Lundbaek and Andersen, 1994; Bruno et al., 2013). 
In the case of the polyphosphoinositides, the decreased 
potencies, relative to diC 8 PI (compare Fig. 9 with Fig. 10), 
may be the result of a dominant effect of the charge-
dependent decrease in the partition coefficient. 
Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we explored 
the partitioning of diC 8 PI, diC 8 PIP 2 , and diC 8 PI(3,4,5) 
P 3 into lipid vesicles but did not observe heats of parti-
tioning (unpublished data), either because the partition 
coefficients are too low to be measured, as suggested 
from the CMCs (Table 1 legend), or because the parti-
tioning is primarily entropy driven. In any case, although 
the head group charges make it challenging to estimate

fluence of charge to lower the partition coefficient into 
lipid bilayers (Peitzsch and McLaughlin, 1993). In the 
LUV experiments, the short-chain nonphosphoinosit-
ide phospholipids and diC 8 PI have similar potencies. 
The similar effects of the charged and zwitterionic phos-
pholipids could be caused by the combined effect of a 
decreased partition coefficient (Marsh and King, 1986; 
Peitzsch and McLaughlin, 1993; Marsh, 2012a) and a 
larger effective head group size (Israelachvili et al., 1980; 
Kleinschmidt and Tamm, 2002) for the charged phos-
pholipids. Thus, molecule per molecule, the charged 
phospholipids would be expected to have increased </p>

<p>Phosphoinositides alter lipid bilayer properties </p>

<p>In contrast to the LUV experiments, in which the short-
chain phospholipids had similar potencies, the bilayer-
modifying rank-order potency in the planar bilayer 
experiments was PS ≥ PE &gt; PI ≥ PC, which cannot be ac-
counted for simply by different partitioning (Table 1). 
The different rank-order potencies in the LUVs and pla-
nar bilayers, as well as the differences observed for short-
chain phospholipids described here and long-chain 
lysophospholipids from a previous study (Lundbaek and 
Andersen, 1994), reflect the compounds' detailed mo-
lecular properties, including the effective cross-sectional 
areas of the acyl chains relative to the head groups-as 
well as the lengths of their acyl chains relative to those 
of the bilayer-forming lipids in the host bilayer (Aagaard 
et al., 2006; Ingólfsson and Andersen, 2011). Ingólfsson 
and Andersen (2011), in particular, found that the sign 
of the effect of an n-alkyl alcohol on lipid bilayer prop-
erties varied with the n-alkyl length (short-chain alcohols 
increased gA channel dimerization; long-chain alcohols 
decreased dimerization). The chain length at which the 
transition occurred furthermore varied with the host 
bilayer phospholipid acyl chain length. The relative dif-
ferences in bilayer-modifying potency observed in the 
stopped-flow and single-channel experiments thus may 
differ (see also Ingólfsson and Andersen, 2010). 
The different rank-order potencies of the short-and 
long-chain PIP 2 s in single-channel versus fluorescence 
assays again are likely to reflect different perturbations of 
the membrane acyl chains. The hydrophobic and electro-
static contributions to the free energy of adsorption at the 
bilayer-solution interface tend to be additive (Zaslavsky 
et al., 1978; Israelachvili et al., 1980; Tanford, 1980; King 
and Marsh, 1987; Buser et al., 1994), meaning that the dif-
ference in ionic strength between the fluorescence and 
single-channel experiments should have similar effects 
on the adsorption of the long-and short-chain PIP 2 s. 
The lack of effect of diC 18:1 PIP 2 in the fluorescence 
and electrophysiological assays, when added through the 
aqueous phase, is in striking contrast to the effects ob-
served when the compound is added through the lipid 
phase (compare Figs. 3, 6, and 7). The key difference 
between these experiments is the elimination of the 
micelle→water and water→bilayer partitioning steps, 
which also may have implications for the design and inter-
pretation of cell physiological experiments. For example, 
the negative correlation between the PIP 2 concentra-
tion needed to elicit an effect and the length of the PIP 2 
acyl chain (Rohács et al., 1999; Jin et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 
2003; Vaithianathan et al., 2008) is often attributed to 
higher partitioning of PIP 2 s with longer acyl chains. Yet, 
the modest differences between the dose-response curves 
for diC 8 -and brain PIP 2 , which cannot be accounted for 
by the difference in hydrophobicity of their acyl chains, 
show that the correlation between CMC and bilayer par-
titioning is complicated-at least in systems contain-
ing both micelles and bilayers (see beginning of this </p>

<p>inositol ring suggests that the differences in potency are 
caused mainly by differences in bilayer partitioning. 
The bilayer-modifying potencies of the long-chain 
PIP 2 and the short-chain phosphoinositides and other 
phospholipids varied with the experimental system, 
but there was overall concordance between the results 
obtained in planar bilayers and LUVs, indicating that 
bilayer-modifying effects are little affected by changes in 
ionic strength (and the associated changes in ionization) 
or the presence of decane. The key difference we observed 
was with the long-chain PIP 2 s. When added through the 
aqueous solution, brain PIP 2 altered bilayer properties, 
whereas diC 18:1 PIP 2 did not-and diC 18:1 PIP 2 remained 
inactive after prolonged (30 min) incubation. This dif-
ference may be important for the design and interpre-
tation of experiments in biological membranes. To gain 
further insight into these observations, we attempted to 
determine the partition coefficients of the long-chain 
PIP 2 s by separating LUV-partitioned PIP 2 from micellar 
PIP 2 using ultracentrifugation and assessing the PIP 2 
concentrations by phosphorus assay (Chen et al., 1956). 
The density of PIP 2 micelles, however, allows them to sedi-
ment with LUVs (unpublished data), precluding sepa-
ration of LUVs from PIP 2 micelles by centrifugation. 
To determine how the short-and long-chain phospho-
lipids alter lipid bilayer properties, we sought to use gA 
single-channel recordings to explore whether the effects 
could be ascribed to changes in bilayer elasticity or cur-
vature. (Long-chain PIP 2 s also may alter the bilayer lat-
eral organization [Wang and Richards, 2012], but we 
have discovered no evidence for lipid de-mixing.) Both 
long-and short-chain PIP 2 s produce modest relative 
changes in f and . Even when comparing the lifetime 
changes observed with the gA 
-(13) and AgA(15) chan-
nels (Figs. 7 D and 11 D), we cannot unambiguously 
distinguish between PIP 2 effects on curvature and elas-
ticity. Furthermore, it remains unclear to what extent the 
electrostatic interactions among the PIP 2 head groups, 
which would tend to increase the effective head group 
size (Kleinschmidt and Tamm, 2002), would influence 
the intrinsic curvature (Lundbaek et al., 1997) and maybe 
also the head group hydration. Importantly, the PIP 2 s 
had no effect on the gA single-channel current ampli-
tudes, indicating that their mole percentage in the first 
lipid shell around the channel was low (compare the con-
trasting results obtained with other anionic compounds; 
Lundbaek et al., 1997; Bruno et al., 2007). Though not 
con clusive evidence, this suggests that electrostatic effects 
are likely to be of minor importance at physiological 
mole percentages. 
In contrast, diC 8 PC, -PI, -PS, and -PE produce greater 
increases in f and  for the short, as compared with 
the long, gA channels, indicating that short-chain non-
polyphosphoinositide phospholipids increase bilayer 
elasticity. The results, nevertheless, do not rule out fur-
ther effects of lipid curvature (Lundbaek et al., 2010a,b). </p>

<p>section). The apparent differences in bilayer partition-
ing of the diC 18:1 and brain PIP 2 analogues in our assays 
also may manifest themselves in cell physiological stud-

fact, have a functional basis. </p>

<p>Conclusions </p>

<p>Both long-and short-chain phosphoinositides are bilayer-
modifying molecules in that they can alter their target 
protein function by a combination of direct (protein bind-
ing) and indirect (bilayer mediated) effects. The changes 
in bilayer properties occur at physiologically relevant 
concentrations (mole percentage of membrane lipids), 
in the case of the long-chain PIP 2 s, and at pharmaco-
logically relevant concentrations, in the case of short-
chain compounds. It thus becomes important to consider 
the changes in membrane properties resulting from 
local PIP 2 depletion or enrichment, which may be a con-
tributing mechanism through which PIP 2 alters protein 
function. Our results suggest a strategy for identifying, 
or excluding, such nonspecific bilayer effects. Effects at 
low micromolar concentrations of (long or short chain) 
PIP 2 s are likely to reflect specific interactions with the 
target protein, whereas effects observed only at 10 µM 
or higher concentrations are likely to reflect, at least in 
part, altered bilayer properties. It is furthermore possi-
ble to test for nonspecific bilayer effects using not only 
short-chain phosphoinositides but also other short-
chain phospholipids. </p>

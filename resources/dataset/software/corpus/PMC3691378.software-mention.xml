<p>ABSTRACT </p>

<p>Purpose: This study was performed to determine the buccal alveolar bone thickness following rapid maxillary 
expansion (RME) using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). 
Materials and Methods: Twenty-four individuals (15 females, 9 males; 13.9 years) that underwent RME therapy 
were included. Each patient had CBCT images available before (T1), after (T2), and 2 to 3 years after (T3) maxil-
lary expansion therapy. Coronal multiplanar reconstruction images were used to measure the linear transverse dimen-
sions, inclinations of teeth, and thickness of the buccal alveolar bone. One-way ANOVA analysis was used to com-
pare the changes between the three times of imaging. Pairwise comparisons were made with the Bonferroni method. 
The level of significance was established at p⁄0.05. 
Results: The mean changes between the points in time yielded significant differences for both molar and premolar 
transverse measurements between T1 and T2 (p⁄0.05) and between T1 and T3 (p⁄0.05). When evaluating the 
effect of maxillary expansion on the amount of buccal alveolar bone, a decrease between T1 and T2 and an increase 
between T2 and T3 were found in the buccal bone thickness of both the maxillary first premolars and maxillary first 
molars. However, these changes were not significant. Similar changes were observed for the angular measurements. 
Conclusion: RME resulted in non-significant reduction of buccal bone between T1 and T2. These changes were 
reversible in the long-term with no evident deleterious effects on the alveolar buccal bone. (Imaging Sci Dent 2013;

<p>nal representation of a three-dimensional (3D) object and 
do not allow the orthodontist to evaluate buccal bone 
widths or to measure transverse changes associated with 
maxillary expansion such as intermolar and interpremolar 
width. Furthermore, the presence or absence of buccal 
bone cannot be determined with conventional radiographs. 
Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) was develop-
ed in the 1990s as an evolutionary process resulting from 
the demand for 3D information. CBCT is more affordable 
than medical CT and requires less space. 
5 Therefore, it is </p>

<p>very convenient for use in the dental office. Moreover, 
CBCT offers higher resolution and produces a lower radia-
tion dose than does medical CT. 
5 Images that cannot be </p>

<p>produced with traditional radiography are accessible by 
CBCT through the use of multiplanar reconstruction 
(MPR). The MPR function of the dedicated CBCT soft-
ware allows coronal, sagittal, and oblique images to be 
created from the original axial slices from which the vol-
ume is built. CBCT software incorporates reference lines 
that make the location of slices simple. For example, when 
observing a small segment of a complete image, lines in 
the sagittal view and coronal view will correlate and indi-
cate the position of the analyzed object. 
6 The discovery </p>

<p>and improvement of three-dimensional imaging provides 
a new perspective on the effects of maxillary expansion. </p>

<p>The purpose of this study was to utilize CBCT technol-
ogy to study the post-treatment effect of maxillary expan-
sion on the dento-alveolar region and buccal bone using 
expansion appliances on the maxillary complex. </p>

<p>Materials and Methods </p>

<p>Approval for the study (HSC-DB-11-0264) was granted 
by the Institutional Review Board of University of Texas 
at Houston Health Science Center. The study sample was 
formed retrospectively using the records of 24 individuals 
(15 females, 9 males; 13.9±2.4 years) that required 
maxillary expansion therapy as part of their comprehen-
sive orthodontic treatment and had a complete set of images 
taken at specified points in time. We investigated the 
effects of RME therapy in non-surgical orthodontic pati-
ents. Therefore, subjects with craniofacial anomalies that 
would have required any type of surgical intervention 
were not included in the study. Individuals with prior ortho-
dontic treatment history such as phase I treatment were 
also excluded from the sample. 
Each patient had CBCT images available pre-expansion 
(T1), post-expansion (T2), and post-treatment (two-to-three 
years after expansion therapy; T3). Twenty-three patients 
had a Hyrax appliance that was either 2-banded (support-</p>

pansion arms along the gingiva of the premolars) or 4-
banded (supported by bilateral maxillary first premolars 
and first molars). Another expansion device was included 
in the maxillary member of a Twin Block appliance. Maxil-
lary expansion was started at the beginning of orthodontic 
treatment for all of the patients and the appliance was 
activated by either one or two turns (1/4 mm/turn) per day 
until the maxillary alveolar arch constriction was over-
corrected. The total expansion time was 3-4 weeks with a 
mean of 22.8 days. 
Galileos Comfort (Sirona Dental Systems GmbH, Ben-
sheim, Germany) X-ray unit was used to capture the CBCT 
images of the individuals with exposure parameters of 85 
kVp, 21 mA, 14 seconds, 0.3 mm voxel size and with vol-
ume dimensions of 15 cm×15 cm×15 cm. The image re-
construction time was approximately 4.5 minutes. The 
images were viewed and assessed with <rs id="software-2" type="software">OsiriX</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Pixmeo</rs>, 
Geneva, Switzerland). Two-dimensional coronal slices 
(Fig. 1) were created in order to measure the amount of 
dental expansion, angulation of the teeth, and buccal bone 
width using the reslicing function of the software. All 
CBCT measurements were made on standardized slices 
created at the level of trifurcation of the maxillary first 
molars and bifurcation of the maxillary first premolars 
perpendicular to the midsagittal plane. Palatal expansion 
at the maxillary first molars and first premolars was mea-
sured at the most palatal aspect of the teeth. Buccal bone 
measurements of the maxillary first molars and first pre-
molars were made at the level of their trifurcation and 
bifurcation points, respectively. Linear measurements were 
recorded in millimeters, and angular measurements were </p>

<p>recorded in degrees (Table 1). 
All of the recorded data from the three points in time 
were compared and analyzed using one-way ANOVA 
analysis. Multiple comparisons were made using Bon-
ferroni's method. The level of significance was set at p⁄ 
0.05 for all statistical analyses. Records of ten random 
patients between T1 and T3 were used for re-measure-
ments and an error study. Intraclass correlation coeffici-
ents (ICCs) were calculated from the original and secon-
dary measurements. </p>

<p>Results </p>

<p>The ICCs ranged between 0.85 and 0.98 indicating a 
high level of repeatability for the measurements. Both the 
molar and premolar width measurements (Table 2) show-
ed significant differences among the three points in time 
(p⁄0.001). The transversal arch width measurement for 
the maxillary first molar increased an average of 3.95 mm 
after expansion therapy (p⁄0.001) and decreased 1.66 
mm between T2 and T3 (p= =0.07). The arch width mea-
surement for the maxillary first premolar increased an 
average of 3.58 mm following expansion (p⁄0.001), and 
decreased less than 0.1 mm between T2 and T3 (p= =0.99). 
With regard to changes in the angulation of the first 
molars and first premolars (Table 3), the only significant 
difference observed was between the angulation of the 
maxillary left first molar among the three points in time 
(p= =0.004). Significant decreases were recorded in the 
angulation of the maxillary left first molar following max-
illary expansion (p= =0.011). At the post-treatment time 
point (T3), the only significant change was a subsequent </p>

<p>Measurement 
Definition </p>

<p>Intermolar width (mm) 
Linear distance between the most convex point on the palatal surface of the left maxillary 
first molar to the most convex point of the palatal surface on the right maxillary first molar. </p>

<p>Interpremolar width (mm)

first premolar to the most convex point of the palatal surface on the right maxillary first premolar. </p>

<p>Molar buccal-lingual angulation (� ) 
Buccolingual inclination of the molars was measured between the longitudinal axis of 
the palatal root of the maxillary first molar and a horizontal line perpendicular to the midsagittal 
plane, measured for both left and right sides </p>

<p>Premolar buccal-lingual angulation (� ) 
Buccolingual inclination of the premolars was measured between the longitudinal axis of 
the palatal root of the maxillary first premolar and a horizontal line perpendicular to 
the midsagittal plane, measured for both left and right sides </p>

<p>Maxillary first molar buccal 
Linear distance from the root of the maxillary 1st molar at the level of trifurcation to

<p>increase in the angulation of the maxillary left first molar 
(p= =0.014). 
When comparing the effect of maxillary expansion on 
the buccal plate of the maxillary first molars and maxil-
lary first premolars (Table 4), no significant changes were 
recorded for any of the teeth measured (left and right maxil-
lary first molars and premolars). Upon the completion of 
maxillary expansion, a decrease in buccal plate thickness 
was observed for all of the teeth. However, the changes 
were not significant. At the postretention point in time 
(T3), an increase in buccal plate thickness was observed 
for all the teeth. The changes, however, were also not 
significant. </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>Besides the desired skeletal effects, rapid maxillary 
expansion can induce dental changes as well. In some 
instances, significant buccal tipping of the maxillary poste-
rior teeth, 
1,2 periodontal consequences, 
3 and even tooth </p>

<p>resorption, 
7,8 may be observed. According to a contem-</p>

<p>porary CBCT investigation of RME treatment, significant 
root volume loss was observed for all investigated poste-</p>

<p>rior teeth. 
9 However, it was also shown that there was no </p>

<p>significant relationship between the period of RME, the 
length of retention, and the total area of resorption affect-
ing the anchor teeth. 
8 Additionally, it was reported that </p>

<p>the proportion of repair tissue in the defects became greater 
with more prolonged retention periods. </p>

<p>7   CBCT imaging has made it possible to examine the vari-
ous aspects of the maxillofacial complex in relation to time 
and dental applications. It was recently shown using cada-
ver heads that CBCT can be used to quantitatively assess 
buccal bone height and buccal bone thickness with high 
precision and accuracy. 
10 In this study, CBCT technology </p>

<p>enabled us to analyze the changes in buccal bone width 
following RME over time, which may not be possible with 
other techniques. However, as is the case with all the oth-
er radiographic imaging techniques, CBCT imaging should 
only be used after a careful review of the patient's health 
and imaging history and the completion of a thorough 
clinical examination. 
11 The CBCT images used in this study </p>

<p>were taken from a previous collection and were investi-
gated retrospectively. The authors of this report support 
the view that frequent exposure of orthodontic patients to 
CBCT scans with a large field of view (FOV) may not be </p>

<p>justified. 
The immediate effects of RME therapy showed reduc-
tion in buccal bone, but the reduction was not significant. 
Garib et al presented striking results within the short term 
after RME treatment such as significant expansion, buc-
cal crown tipping, loss in the buccal plate, and bone dehisc-
ence. 
3 Corbridge et al 
12 utilized CBCT images to demon-</p>

<p>strate that with quad-helix appliance therapy, the teeth 
moved through the alveolus, leading to a substantial de-
crease in buccal bone thickness and increase in lingual 
bone thickness. While our study mainly considered the 
use of a hyrax expander and not a quad helix, we were 
not able to verify a substantial decrease in buccal bone 
thickness following RME since the changes were not sig-
nificant. Moreover, our results demonstrated that after the 
completion of orthodontic treatment with fixed appli-
ances, buccal bone width is almost regained due to sub-
sequent uprighting of the molar and premolar roots. The 
variability in the previous studies can be explained by the 
findings of Rungcharassaeng et al. 
13 They observed via </p>

<p>the use of CBCT images that age, appliance expansion, 
initial buccal bone thickness, and differential expansion 
showed a significant correlation to buccal bone changes 
and dental tipping on the maxillary first molars and pre-
molars, but that the rate of expansion and retention time 
had no significant association. They also suggested that 
buccal crown tipping and reduction in buccal bone thick-
ness of the maxillary posterior teeth are the only expected 
immediate effects of RME, which was confirmed by our 
study. Our paper evaluated changes in buccal bone thick-
ness at a follow-up period that was an average of 2.48 
years post-expansion, which was not previously determin-
ed in the dental literature. The addition of a T3 point in 
time strengthened this study and confirmed observations 
that maxillary expansion can be retained. 
The increase in our transversal dental width measure-
ments following RME agreed with the results of pre-
viously published data. 
3-6,12,13 This increase was mostly </p>

<p>due to skeletal expansion when RME was applied when 
indicated in a timely manner with no major dental side 
effects. Kartalian et al 
14 successfully demonstrated that no </p>

<p>significant dental tipping occurred after RME treatment 
but significant alveolar tipping did occur. In our study, we 
did not measure buccal tipping of the alveolar bone. 
However, a significant amount of dental tipping took 
place in our sample group. 
The findings of this study confirmed that rapid maxil-
lary expansion was an effective method for correcting the 
insufficient transverse dimension of the dentition and the </p>

<p>palate. Upon the completion of orthodontic treatment, no 
significant change occurred in the transversal dimension 
and expansion results were stable. At this time, further 
determining the cause and long-term consequences of 
moving teeth into the buccal plate is important. Additio-
nal prospective studies with a greater number of subjects 
in various age groups with a wide variety of expansion 
protocols will shine more light on the changes induced by 
rapid maxillary expansion. In a future study, quantifica-
tion of the initial bone density in the maxilla may also be 
beneficial to determine whether RME is successful or 
not. 
Based on the results of our study, clinicians should be 
aware that maxillary expansion could reduce the width of 
the buccal plate and cause tipping of the maxillary poste-
rior teeth. However, after the completion of comprehen-
sive orthodontic treatment by means of full fixed appli-
ances, a subsequent increase in buccal bone width should 
be expected. </p>

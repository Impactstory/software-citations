<p>Apoptosis is a fundamental homeostatic mechanism essential for the normal growth, development and maintenance of every 
tissue and organ. Dying cells have been defined as apoptotic by distinguishing features, including cell contraction, nuclear 
fragmentation, blebbing, apoptotic body formation and maintenance of intact cellular membranes to prevent massive protein 
release and consequent inflammation. We now show that during early apoptosis limited membrane permeabilization occurs in 
blebs and apoptotic bodies, which allows release of proteins that may affect the proximal microenvironment before the 
catastrophic loss of membrane integrity during secondary necrosis. Blebbing, apoptotic body formation and protein release 
during early apoptosis are dependent on ROCK and myosin ATPase activity to drive actomyosin contraction. We identified 231 
proteins released from actomyosin contraction-dependent blebs and apoptotic bodies by adapted SILAC (stable isotope labeling 
with amino acids in cell culture) combined with mass spectrometry analysis. The most enriched proteins released were the 
nucleosomal histones, which have previously been identified as damage-associated molecular pattern proteins (DAMPs) that 
can initiate sterile inflammatory responses. These results indicate that limited membrane permeabilization occurs in blebs and 
apoptotic bodies before secondary necrosis, leading to acute and localized release of immunomodulatory proteins during the 
early phase of active apoptotic membrane blebbing. Therefore, the shift from apoptosis to secondary necrosis is more graded 
than a simple binary switch, with the membrane permeabilization of apoptotic bodies and consequent limited release of DAMPs 
contributing to the transition between these states. 
nuclear condensation and fragmentation, and actomyosin 
contraction-dependent membrane blebbing and apoptotic 
body formation. 
10-12 The driving force behind apoptotic 
actomyosin contractility is caspase-mediated cleavage and 
consequent constitutive activation of ROCK1. 
11,12 Blebs are 
formed when the plasma membrane delaminates from the 
cortical cytoskeletal network to form blisters that are 
expanded by increased hydrostatic pressure produced by 
actomyosin-mediated cellular contraction. 
13,14 As apoptosis 
progresses, blebs may break away from the cell body to form 
membrane-clad apoptotic bodies. A common assumption is 
that apoptotic bodies have a passive role in apoptotic cell 
clearance simply because they are smaller and therefore 
more readily phagocytosed than the intact cell body. </p>

<p>15,16 </p>

<p>Moreover, inhibition of ROCK activity significantly reduces 
apoptotic body formation and apoptotic cell phagocytosis. </p>

<p>15,16 </p>

<p>Therefore, an additional possibility is that apoptotic bodies 
have active roles in promoting apoptotic cell clearance. 
Apoptotic cells signal their demise by displaying markers 
such as phosphatidylserine that help phagocytes dock to the 
dying cell via direct or bridged interactions with recognition 
receptors. 
1,3 The membranes of apoptotic bodies present the 
same externalized signals to phagocytic cells, which similarly 
aids their recognition and clearance. However, we now show 
that unlike the membranes of the apoptotic cell body, a 
significant proportion of apoptotic body membranes do not 
form impermeable barriers, allowing for the limited macro-
molecule ingress and egress. Inhibition of actomyosin 
contraction through ROCK or myosin ATPase blockade 
reduces apoptotic body numbers formed during early apop-
tosis and concomitantly represses protein release without 
affecting the apoptotic program. Quantitative mass spectro-
metry (MS) identified nucleosomal histones, which are 
validated DAMPs, as the most highly enriched proteins 
released in an actomyosin-dependent manner before 
secondary necrosis. Stable isotope-labeled histones released 
from apoptotic cells were identified as being phagocytosed by 
macrophages. These results show that the progression from 
apoptosis to secondary necrosis does not occur as a two-state 
switch. Instead, as they are generated, the permeable 
membranes of apoptotic bodies allow the release of limited 
amounts of DAMPs that would locally engage with compo-
nents of the innate immune system, thereby providing a 
mechanism that would contribute to a phased transition 
between apoptosis and full-blown secondary necrosis. </p>

<p>Results </p>

<p>Apoptotic bodies and blebs lose membrane integrity. 
The membrane-impermeable nucleic acid dye PI is often 
used in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to 
categorize dead cells as either apoptotic (PI excluded) or 
necrotic (PI permitted). 
17 Despite the general application of 
this binary classification, we observed that apoptotic blebs in 
NIH3T3 fibroblasts treated with tumor necrosis factor a 
(TNFa) plus cycloheximide (CHX) can permit PI penetration 
while the cell body continues to exclude the nucleic acid stain 
(Figure 1a). Time-lapse microscopy revealed that shortly after 
blebbing onset (B4 h after TNFa/CHX treatment), newly formed 
blebs and apoptotic bodies (small membrane-encapsulated </p>

<p>subcellular particles that dissociate from blebbing cells) 
appear that do not exclude PI (Figure 1b, from 4 : 14 : 30, 
examples indicated by white, blue, yellow or red arrows). The 
membrane permeability of these newly formed structures 
precedes the loss of membrane integrity of the remaining cell 
body during secondary necrosis by a substantial period 
(Figure 1b, from 5 : 33 onwards). 
To characterize apoptotic body membrane permeability, we 
assessed PI staining of the apoptotic bodies released from 
NIH3T3 cells 4 h after TNFa/CHX treatment. Analysis of small 
subcellular debris (low forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter 
(SSC), Figure 2a first panel) revealed that a large subpopula-
tion of the 100 000 counted apoptotic bodies were PI positive 
(defined by gatings that count r1% of autofluorescent 
apoptotic bodies in the absence of PI, Figure 2a second 
panel), indicating that these apoptotic bodies not only 
contained nucleic acids but also allowed entry of 668 Da PI 
molecules (Figure 2a middle panel). Treatment of apoptotic 
bodies with RNAseA alone, or in combination with DNAse1, 
reduced PI staining (Figure 2a fourth and fifth panels), 
indicating that molecules as large as RNAseA and DNAse1 
(13 and 31 kDa, respectively) accessed the interior of 
apoptotic bodies and degraded nucleic acid cargo, thus 
reducing PI fluorescence. The reduction in PI staining by 
RNAse þ DNAse1 was significant (Po0.01) following the 
induction of apoptosis 4 h after treatment withTNFa/CHX, anti-
CD95 (Fas receptor) antibody/CHX or ultraviolet light (UV) in 
NIH3T3 established mouse fibroblasts (Figure 2b), primary 
mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs; Figure 2c), MCF10a 
human mammary epithelial cells (Figure 2d) and primary 
mouse keratinocytes (Figure 2e). These results indicate that 
whether the apoptotic stimulus was extrinsic or instrinsic, or 
whether the cells were primary or established, or epithelial or 
mesenchymal, a significant proportion of apoptotic bodies 
have membranes permissive for macromolecule passage. 
The permeability of apoptotic body membranes to macro-
molecules was additionally validated using NIH3T3 cells-
expressing membrane-tagged green fluorescent protein 
(mGFP; Figure 2f left panel). 
18 Following the induction of 
apoptosis for 4 h, B33% of resulting apoptotic bodies had 
mGFP fluorescence greater than the autofluorescence of 
apoptotic bodies from unlabeled cells (Figure 2f right panel). 
Treatment with Proteinase K (MW ¼ 28 kDa) significantly 
(Po0.01) reduced the proportion of GFP-positive apoptotic 
bodies by 70%, indicating that most apoptotic bodies did not 
exclude Proteinase K (Figure 2g). When GFP-positive 
apoptotic bodies were incubated with PI in the absence or 
presence of RNAse þ DNAse1, PI staining of the 11% double 
GFP/PI-positive apoptotic bodies was significantly (Po0.01) 
reduced by over 50% through the actions of RNAse þ 
DNAse1 (Figures 2h and i). These observations indicate that 
many apoptotic bodies failed to exclude molecules as large as 
31 kDa, suggesting that their membranes also would allow 
comparably sized molecules to escape. </p>

and lactate dehydrogenase release. We previously 
showed that apoptotic membrane blebbing results from 
caspase-mediated cleavage and consequent activation

<p>Cell Death and Differentiation </p>

<p>absence or presence of Y27632 or Blebbistatin revealed that 
actomyosin contraction inhibition significantly (Po0.01) 
reduced apoptotic body formation following apoptosis induc-
tion by each stimulus (Figure 3c). In contrast, caspase 
activity induced by TNFa/CHX, anti-CD95/CHX or UV was 
insensitive to Y27632 or Blebbistatin (Figure 3d), indicating 
that actomyosin contraction was required for apoptotic body 
formation, but not for apoptosis induction by these stimuli. 
Similarly, cleavage of the caspase substrate ROCK1 in 
TNFa/CHX-treated cells was not affected by Y27632 
(Figure 3d inset). Consistent with previous findings 
16 and 
with the ROCK inhibitory action of Y27632, ROCK1 knock-
down (Figure 3e, inset panels) impaired actomyosin 
contractile force generation leading to significantly (Po0.01) 
reduced apoptotic body formation (Figure 3e) and plasma 
membrane blebbing in a large proportion of cells (Figure 3f), 
without affecting caspase activation as determined by 
PARP1 cleavage (Figure 3e, inset panels). We next 
measured lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, monomer MW ¼ 35 
kDa, tetramer MW ¼ 140 kDa) activity in conditioned media, 
the release of which is often used to measure loss of 
membrane integrity. 
21 LDH release was assayed in media 
from each of the four indicated conditions at 4 and 24 h, 
relative to the amount of LDH released from cells induced to 
undergo necrotic death by three freeze/thaw cycles. Parallel-
ing the effects on apoptotic body formation (Figure 3c), the 
increase in LDH activity present in apoptotic cell conditioned 
media (AC-CM) at 4 h compared with untreated cells was 
significantly (Po0.001) reduced when actomyosin contrac-
tility was blocked with Y27632 or Blebbistatin treatment 
(Figure 4a). However, there was no effect of either inhibitor 
on LDH release 24 h after apoptosis induction, consistent 
with protein release at this late time point resulting from loss 
of membrane integrity and lysis during secondary necrosis, 
which was unaffected by the inhibition of actomyosin 
contractility. In addition, release of the chromatin-associated 
nuclear high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1, MW ¼ 25 
kDa) into tissue culture media, which had GFP added as a 
processing/loading control, was undetectable at 12 h after 
apoptosis induction but prominent in each condition at 24 h 
(Figure 4b), consistent with it being a later-released necrosis 
marker. </p>

<p>22 </p>

<p>SEM revealed that TNFa/CHX-treated cell 
morphology could not be distinguished from TNFa/CHX þ 
Y27632 or TNFa/CHX þ Blebbistatin-treated cells after 24 h 
(Figure 4c). Although cells undergoing secondary necrosis 
released proteins such as LDH (Figure 4a) and HMGB1 
(Figure 4b), their FSC/SSC profiles revealed that they largely </p>

<p>remain intact with cells sizes smaller than healthy viable cells 
(Figure 4d). The ability of actomyosin contraction inhibitors 
Y27632 and Blebbistatin to suppress LDH release during 
early apoptosis (Figure 4a) was directly associated with the 
significant reduction in apoptotic bodies produced during 
early apoptosis (Figure 3c), which would then allow limited 
protein release before complete loss of membrane integrity 
during secondary necrosis. </p>

<p>Proteomic analysis of AC-CM by quantitative MS. Having 
established that a proportion of apoptotic bodies allow limited 
entry and exit of proteins, we sought to identify proteins 
released during early apoptosis, dependent upon actomyosin 
contractility, to drive blebbing and apoptotic body formation. 
To accomplish this, proteins were concentrated from condi-
tioned media using StrataClean resin and separated on 
polyacrylamide gels. Similar to LDH release (Figure 4a), 
there was a clear increase in bulk protein release 4 h after 
treatment with apoptotic inducer, which was reduced by 
Y27632 or Blebbistatin (Figure 5a). We then performed 
quantitative proteomic analysis using an adapted approach 
combining stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell 
culture (SILAC) and MS. 
23 Individual NIH3T3 fibroblasts 
populations were grown in defined SILAC medium containing 
light (no isotope label), medium (Lys4, Arg6) or heavy (Lys8, 
Arg10) amino acids (Supplementary Figure 1). Each labeled 
cells population was assigned an experimental treatment: 
reference (untreated); apoptosis (TNFa/CHX); apoptosis with 
reduced apoptotic body formation (TNFa/CHX þ Y27632 or 
Blebbistatin) and six replicate experiments performed with 
each set of conditions cycled through the SILAC labels 
(Supplementary Figure 1). After 4 h, AC-CM was collected 
and pooled from each of the three conditions, followed by 
concentration and electrophoresis before tryptic digestion 
and analysis of protein tryptic fragments by MS. A hit-list was 
compiled of proteins that were significantly different (using a 
randomized permutation test, Po0.05) between treatment 
groups, which were enriched for release from apoptotic cells 
relative to control cells, and which were reduced by both 
Y27632 and Blebbistatin to inhibit actomyosin contraction 
(Supplementary Table 1, the top 20 released proteins are in 
Table 1). Using these criteria, 231 proteins were released 
from apoptotic bodies in an actomyosin-dependent manner, 
while the release of five extracellular matrix proteins were 
actually reduced (Fibronectin1, Sparc, Timp2, Thrombos-
pondin2 and Decorin), which could be at least partially 
restored by Y27632 and Blebbistatin (Figure 5b). Consistent </p>

<p>with LDH as a protein validated for actomyosin-dependent 
release from apoptotic bodies (Figure 4a), it also was 
identified in the MS analysis (Supplementary Table 1). When 
fold enrichment in protein release was compared with protein 
mass, it was apparent that most proteins were r100 kDa, 
while the most abundantly released proteins were among 
the smallest (Figure 5c). Gene ontology analysis revealed 
that most proteins were either enzymes or structural/adapter 
proteins (Figure 5d). After collecting apoptotic bodies by 
sorting, gel electrophoresis revealed Coomassie-stained 
proteins with a range of molecular weights (Figure 5e, left 
panel), whereas western blotting showed Lamin A and 
Gelsolin in apoptotic bodies (Figure 5e, middle and left 
panels). These results indicate that even if proteins may 
be released, apoptotic bodies retain at least a proportion of 
their contents, including the proteins identified as being 
significantly released (Table 1). Relative to their propor-
tions in the proteome, enzymes (P ¼ 3.18 Â 10 
À 10 ) and </p>

<p>structural/adapter proteins (P ¼ 0.032) were over-represented 
among released proteins, whereas transcription factors 
(P ¼ 0.018) and receptors (P ¼ 5.55 Â 10 </p>

<p>À 5 </p>

<p>) were under-
represented. The presence of a number of enzymes 
associated with glycolysis likely reflects their relatively high 
abundance, solubility and cytoplasmic localization, 
24 resulting 
in their tendency to be released from permeabilized apoptotic 
bodies. The majority of the actin-associated proteins were also 
previously found to be more abundant in protrusive lamellipo-
dia than cell bodies. 
25 Given that following initial bleb 
protrusion, there is recruitment of actomyosin cytoskeletal 
components to facilitate bleb retraction, 
26 it is logical that 
there would be common enriched proteins in protrusive 
lamellipodia and blebs/apoptotic bodies, which in the latter 
case may be released from permeabilized membranes during 
early apoptosis. 
Gelsolin was one such lamellipodia enriched protein 
25 that 
also was one of the most highly enriched cytoplasmic proteins </p>

<p>identified (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1). Gelsolin reg-
ulates actin filament dynamics, and a secreted form has 
important extracellular roles in the regulation of inflamma-
tion. 
27,28 To validate the SILAC/MS results and determine 
whether Gelsolin release was dependent upon actomyosin 
contraction and consequent apoptotic body formation 
(Figure 3c), we blotted AC-CM from cells that were untreated 
or treated with TNFa/CHX for 4 h in the absence or presence 
of ROCK inhibitor Y27632 or myosin ATPase inhibitor 
Blebbistatin. Both Y27632 and Blebbistatin significantly 
(Po0.01) reduced Gelsolin release relative to control 
apoptotic cells (Figure 5f), despite these treatments having 
no effect on caspase activation (Figure 3d). These results </p>

<p>confirm that Gelsolin release during early apoptosis is largely 
dependent upon actomyosin contraction, which drives bleb-
bing and apoptotic body formation. </p>

<p>Actomyosin contractility promotes histone transloca-
tion to membrane blebs and apoptotic bodies. The most 
highly enriched proteins released were nucleosomal histones 
(Table 1; Supplementary Table 1), which have been 
characterized as potent DAMPs that activate cells of the 
innate immune system by binding to Toll-like receptors 2, 4 
and 9 (TLR) either directly or complexed with DNA. 
29-31 In 
addition, histones are significant autoantigens in diseases 
such as systemic lupus erythematosus.

<p>DAMPs were identified in this screen (Supplementary 
Table 1), including S100 and heat shock family proteins. 
Transmission electron microscopy of apoptotic NIH3T3 cells 
revealed that portions of nuclei could be observed within 
membrane blebs (Figure 6a, indicated with arrow). GFP-
labeled histone H3 (GFP-H3) was translocated from the 
nucleus to blebs in a population of apoptotic NIH3T3 cells 
(Figure 6b). FACS sorting apoptotic bodies from untrans-
fected control and GFP-H3-expressing cells and then gating 
for GFP fluorescence greater than the level of autofluores-
cence in untransfected cells (Figure 6c, first to third panels) 
along with FITC-labeled polystyrene microbeads revealed 
that the total number of GFP-H3-positive apoptotic bodies 
was significantly (Po0.01) reduced by Y27632 or Blebbis-
tatin (Figure 6d). In addition to total number, the proportion of 
GFP-H3-positive apoptotic bodies was significantly (Po0.01) 
reduced by Y27632 or Blebbistatin (Figure 6e). These results 
indicate that not only is actomyosin contractility necessary for 
the generation of apoptotic bodies (Figure 3c) within which 
nuclear fragments may be contained, but consistent with our 
previous observation that actomyosin contractility is neces-
sary for the tearing apart of apoptotic nuclei, 
33 actomyosin 
contraction contributes to the translocation of histones from 
nuclei into blebs and actomyosin-dependent apoptotic bodies 
from which they may be released into the extracellular 
environment. </p>

<p>Macrophage phagocytosis of released histone proteins. 
Macrophages internalize molecules as part of the innate

34 To

<p>were collected and then incubated for 2 h with RAW-264.7 
mouse macrophages that had been treated with Bafilomycin 
A1 to block endosome acidification and subsequent proteo-
lysis. Cell lysates were prepared, and for each protein a 
minimum of two SILAC-labeled tryptic peptides were 
unambiguously identified on the basis of their mass 
difference from endogenous peptides. An example trace of 
the peptide LLLPGELAK from histone H2B identified from 
unlabeled endogenous protein and Lys 8 -labeled AC-CM that 
had been taken up by RAW-264.7 cells is shown in 
Figure 7a. All four nucleosomal histones were identified as 
being phagocytosed by RAW-264.7 cells from AC-CM 
(Table 2). In addition, Vimentin was also identified as being 
taken up by RAW-264.7 cells (Table 2). Interestingly, 
citrullinated Vimentin (in which a terminal nitrogen on the 
side chain of arginines is replaced by oxygen) is a major 
autoantigen associated with rheumatoid arthritis pathogen-
esis. 
35 Treatment of RAW-264.7 with varying amounts of 
purified recombinant histone proteins resulted in significant 
release of TNFa induced by H2A, H2B and H3, but not H4 
(Figure 7b). Consistent with this response of being the result 
of TLR activation of the NF-kB pathway, 
36 H2A treatment 
dramatically increased NFKBIA (IkBa) phosphorylation 
(Figure 7c). These results show that proteins released from 
actomyosin-dependent blebs and apoptotic bodies engage 
with macrophages, revealing a mechanism of communica-
tion between early apoptotic cells and components of the 
innate immune system. </p>

<p>breakdown. 
6,11,33 Apoptotic body permeabilization in early 
apoptosis provides a simple route for intracellular proteins to 
participate in complex extracellular signaling events. Further, 
these observations highlight a novel biological function for 
actomyosin-induced blebbing, which is to generate indepen-
dent subcellular apoptotic bodies that could travel away from 
the apoptotic cell and release protein quanta that alert 
surrounding cells before secondary necrotic membrane 
breakdown. 
37,38 Protein release from apoptotic bodies would 
potentially increase the distance from which innate immune 
cells could detect apoptotic cells. Apoptotic bodies dispatch-
ing 'suicide notes' may be an important mechanism to trigger 
safe and rapid clearance (Figure 7d). In addition, some of 
these proteins released, such as histones, are taken up by 
macrophages, where they may influence information proces-
sing to influence the type, intensity and/or duration of cellular </p>

<p>responses, or may be processed for antigen presentation. 
Histones and Vimentin, which were identified as phagocy-
tosed by macrophages, are significant autoantigens in 
autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus 
and rheumatoid arthritis, respectively, suggesting that apop-
totic bodies could be a source of immunogens. 
39,40 These 
results also reveal that the transition from apoptosis to 
secondary necrosis is not an off/on switch. Apoptotic bodies 
generated during early apoptosis release limited amounts of 
intracellular proteins in advance of secondary necrosis 
thereby providing a means for the phased transition between 
these two states. 
Our systematic quantitative SILAC survey of AC-CM 
identified numerous proteins released during early apoptosis 
that were sensitive to inhibition of actomyosin contraction. The 
most highly enriched proteins were the nucleosomal histones, 
which have previously been validated as DAMPs that 
reportedly act via TLR2, TLR4 and/or TLR9. 
29-31,41 Histone 
engagement of TLRs results in the production and release of 
cytokines and chemokines that alert the innate immune 
system to the presence of damage. Other putative DAMPs 
were identified from the S100 and HSP protein families 
(Supplementary Table 1). However, the validation of these 
proteins as genuine DAMPs is controversial because of the 
possibility that bound enterotoxins accounted for the pro-
inflammatory activities of purified forms of these proteins. </p>

<p>Materials and Methods 
Cell culture. NIH3T3, MEFs, MCF10a and primary keratinocyte cells were 
maintained as described in 
11,33,42,43 , respectively. Generation of ecotropic mGFP 
and GFP-H3 virus and cell transduction was carried out as previously described. </p>

<p>18 </p>

<p>Transfection of NIH3T3 cells with nontargeting and ROCK1 Smartpool 
(Dharmacon, Loughborough, UK) siRNA was performed as previously described. </p>

<p>42 </p>

<p>Murine RAW-264.7 macrophages were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 
10% fetal bovine serum. </p>

<p>Western blotting. Cell lysates were generated with RIPA lysis buffer (10 mM 
TRIS pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 40 mM NaPPi, 50 mM NaF, 1% (v/v) 
NP-40, 0.5% (v/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.025% (w/v) SDS and 1mM Na 3 VO 4 , 
1 mM PMSF). Cell lysates and concentrated conditioned medium were diluted 1 : 4 
with sample buffer and warmed to 70 1C for 10 min. Samples were run on 10% 
SDS-polyacrylamide gels transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride or nitrocellulose 
membranes blocked in 5% (w/v) skimmed milk in TBS before probing with 
antibodies against; GFP, cleaved PARP1 (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK), Gelsolin 
(Abcam, Cambridge, UK), ERK2, HMGB1 (Cell Signaling, Hitchin, UK), actin 
(Santa Cruz, Wembley, UK), ROCK1 (Transduction Labs, Oxford, UK), NFKBIA 
and pNFKBIA (pS32/pS36; Abnova, Heidelberg, Germany). Primary antibodies 
probed with AlexaFluor 680 (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and IR800 (Rockland, 
Peterborough, UK) conjugated secondary antibodies. Imaging and analysis was 
performed using a LiCOR-Odyssey instrument and application software. </p>

<p>Induction of apoptosis and generation of conditioned medium. 
Apoptosis was induced with a combination of 50 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor alpha 
(TNFa; R&amp;D Systems, Abingdon, UK) or 2 mg/ml CD95 antibody (BD Biosciences) 
and 10 mg/ml CHX, or treatment with 0.1 J/cm 
2 UV, following overnight starvation 
in unsupplemented DMEM medium. Cells were then incubated at 37 1C for 
2-24 h as indicated. Medium was further supplemented with: Y27632 (10 mM; 
Calbiochem, Feltham, UK) or Blebbistatin (50 mM; Sigma, Gillingham, UK), as 
indicated. AC-CM was generated by pelleting apoptotic cells in media at 2000 Â g 
for 10 min. AC-CM was routinely determined to be clear of cells and debris by 
microscopic examination. Necrotic cell supernatant was generated from starved 
cells by three freeze-thaw cycles in dry ice. For western blotting, AC-CM was 
concentrated by centrifugation with 10 kDa cutoff Millipore centrifugal filter units at 
4500 Â g for 30 min. Samples were concentrated B30 fold. Before concentrating, 
0.26 mg of recombinant GFP was added to each sample as an internal standard. </p>

<p>Microscopy. Time-lapse microscopy images were acquired with a Â 20 lens 
using a Nikon A1R confocal microscope with a heated stage and 5% CO 2 gas line. 
Gray scale image is transmitted light. Cells were grown on optical glass coverslips 
and apoptosis was induced in a starved medium supplemented with TNFa/CHX 
and 5 mg/ml PI. Immediately after the induction of apoptosis, cells were relocated 
to confocal microscope and time-lapse images were taken every 30 s for 8 h in 
both transmitted light and red fluorescence. High resolution still images of unfixed 
apoptotic cells were acquired with a Â 60 oil immersion lens using same 
conditions as above. The medium was further supplemented with FAST DiO 
(3,3'-dilinoleyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate; Invitrogen) diluted 1 : 500 from 
2.5 mg/ml dissolved in 100% DMSO. Transmission and SEM was performed as 
described in 
33 and 
11 respectively. </p>

<p>Flow cytometry 
Apoptotic body PI permeability: For the assessment of apoptotic body PI 
permeability, 4 h apoptotic NIH3T3 samples were generated with the further 
addition of 5 mg/ml PI, 100 mg/ml RNAseA (Sigma) and/or 200 units/ml DNAse1 
(Invitrogen). Apoptotic samples were analyzed with BD FACSCalibur flow 
cytometer. A total of 100 000 apoptotic bodies were gated using FSC and SSC), 
and PI fluorescence wasdetermined in channel FL3. PI-stained non-apoptotic 
control was used to gate samples. 
GFP-labeled apoptotic body permeability: Apoptotic body proteinase K and 
PI/RNAseA/DNAse1 permeability were assessed in NIH3T3-expressing membrane-
tagged GFP. For proteinase K, 50 mg/ml (Sigma) was added to the cells 2 h after the 
addition of TNFa/CHX and incubated for a further 2 h. The apoptotic samples were 
analyzed with BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Alternatively, apoptotic bodies were </p>

<p>labeled with PI in the presence or absence of 100 mg/ml RNAseA (Sigma) and/or 
200 units/ml DNAse1 (Invitrogen) as described above. A total of 100 000 apoptotic 
bodies were gated using FSC and SSC), and GFP fluorescence was determined in 
channel FL1. PI fluorescence was determined in channel FL3. GFP-positive apoptotic 
bodies gated against non-GFP-expressing apoptotic bodies. Apoptotic cells without PI 
were used to gate PI stained samples. 
Apoptotic body generation: The generation of apoptotic bodies from NIH3T3 
at 4 h was assessed following treatment with TNFa/CHX, anti-CD95/CHX or UV light 
and Y27632 (10mM) or Blebbistatin (50mM). Apoptotic samples were collected, 
diluted 2 : 3 in PBS and an equivalent volume of FITC-Calibrite microsphere beads 
(BD Biosciences) were added to each sample. Apoptotic bodies were gated on FSC 
and SSC. FITC beads were gated based on fluorescence. The number of apoptotic 
bodies was counted alongside 10 000 gated FITC beads. </p>

<p>LDH, caspase activity and TNFa measurements. LDH activity was 
measured with Roche cytotoxicity detection kit according to manufacturer's 
recommendations. After concentration, the samples were diluted 1 : 10 in DMEM 
before LDH activity measurement. After normalization to GFP as determined by 
western blot, 100 ml of sample mixed with equal concentration of dye solution and 
incubated for 20 min in the dark in a 96-well plate. Reaction was stopped with 
50 ml stop solution and solution absorbance was measured with TECAN Safire 
2 at 
490 nm. Sample activity expressed as a percentage of activity detected in necrotic 
sample. Caspase activity was determined from equal cell numbers using 
Caspase-Glo 3/7 kits (Promega, Southampton, UK) according to manufacturer's 
recommendations. TNFa concentrations were determined from equal cell numbers 
and calibrated against a standard curve using a mouse TNFa ELISA kit (R&amp;D 
Systems) according to manufacturer's recommendations. Recombinant purified 
histones were from New England Biolabs (Hitchin, UK). </p>

<p>SILAC and MS. NIH3T3 were grown in DMEM supplemented with dialyzed 
FBS containing specific labeled arginine (Arg) and lysine (Lys) amino acids for five 
passages. Cells were labeled with light/unlabeled (Lys0, Arg0), medium (Lys4, 
Arg6) and heavy (Lys8, Arg10) medium. Amino acids are labeled with the following 
isotopes: Lys4, </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>H 4 ; Lys8, 
13 C 6 , 
15 N 2 ; Arg6, </p>

<p>13 </p>

<p>N 4 (Silantes, 
Munich, Germany). Label incorporation was determined to be 495% by MS 
before cells were used for further experiments. Each labeled population of NIH3T3 
were assigned specific treatments, for example, light, control; medium, TNFa/ 
CHX; and heavy, TNFa/CHX þ Y27632. Each labeled population was used in 
each treatment condition, with Blebbistatin substituting for Y27632 in one set of 
experiments, for a total of six replicates. After 4 h, the supernatants were pooled 
and concentrated with StrataClean resin. Protein was eluted from StrataClean 
resin using 100 ml 1X lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) sample buffer plus 10 mM DTT 
at 951C for 5 min. This was allowed to cool, adjusted to 50 mM iodoacetamide and 
incubated in the dark for 20 min at room temperature. Macrophage extracts (in 8 M 
urea) were adjusted to 1X LDS sample buffer, reduced with DTT and alkylated 
with iodoacetamide as described above. The samples were electrophoresed for 
3 cm on a NuPAGE 4-12% gel using MOPS running buffer (Life Technologies, 
Paisley, UK) at 200 V and then stained with colloidal coomasie. The gel lane was 
cut into five even sections, each section cut into 2-mm cubes, destained with 50% 
acetonitrile/100 mM TEAB pH 8, dried and digested with 1 mg/ml trypsin in 50 mM 
TEAB overnight at 301C. Gel pieces were extracted with 50% acetonitrile, extracts 
combined, dried under vacuum and reconstituted in 0.1 ml 5% acetonitrile/0.1% 
formic acid in water. In some experiments, macrophage extracts (50 mg) were 
reduced and alkylated in 8 M urea, diluted to 1 M urea with 50 mM TEAB pH 8 and 
digested in solution with trypsin (1 : 10 w/w) at 301C for 5 h. Tryptic digests were 
analyzed by LC-MS on a LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer system coupled 
to a Proxeon Easy-LC HPLC system. The peptide mixtures were loaded onto a 
nanoseparations C18 guard column (0.1 Â 20 mm) equilibrated in 0.1% formic 
acid/water at 5 ml/min and then separated on an LC-Packings PepMap C18 
column (0.075 Â 150 mm equilibrated in 0.1% formic acid/water. Peptides were 
eluted with a 120 min discontinuous gradient of acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid at a 
flow rate of 300 nl/min. The column outlet was connected to a Proxeon Flex 
nanospray source fitted with a New Objective FS360 20-10 uncoated emitter and a 
voltage of 2 kV was applied to the emitter. The orbitrap was set to analyze the 
survey scans (m/z 350-2000) at 30 000 resolution and top 10 ions in each duty 
cycle (minimum ion intensity of 5000 cps) were selected for MSMS in the LTQ 
linear ion trap. Ions were excluded for 20 s after two occurrences. The raw files 
were analyzed using <rs id="software-1" type="software">MaxQuant</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">1.2.0.13</rs> and <rs id="software-2" type="software">Proteome Discoverer</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">1.3</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Thermo- Fisher, Loughborough, UK</rs>) against mouse Swiss-Prot database (2012_09, 55744 </p>

<p>entries) database. The Maxquant/ Andromedia search was performed with the 
following criteria (Raw mass spectra were extracted by MaxQuant (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany</rs>, version 1.3.0.5) and searched with 
a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.50 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 6 p.p.m. 
Trypsin was set as the enzyme with two missed cleavages permitted. 
Carbamidomethyl of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification. SILAC labels 
of lysine and arginine, oxidation of methionine and acetyl of the protein N-terminus 
were specified as variable modifications. The identification criteria included peptide 
length to be greater than 7 amino acids residues and both peptide and protein 
FDR levels set at 0.01 (or 1 if the data were submitted to Scaffold Q þ S 
(<rs id="software-4" type="software">Proteome Software</rs> <rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">version 3.6</rs>, Portland, OR, USA). Analysis was undertaken 
both with and without re-quantify active. Proteome Discoverer 1.3 was used to 
search with Mascot using a SILAC (K8/R10) workflow and peptides were validated 
using <rs id="software-5" type="software">Percolator</rs> <rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-number">1.17</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-5" type="creator">University of Washington</rs>) with a FDR of 0.1%. The Mascot 
search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK) used the following criteria: peptide 
tolerance ¼ 10 p.p.m., MSMS tolerance ¼ 0.8 Da, trypsin as the enzyme (two 
missed cleavages permitted), carboxyamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed 
modification with oxidation of methionine and label K8, label R10 as a variable 
modification. The output from both <rs type="software">Maxquant</rs> and Proteome Discoverer 1.3 were 
processed through Scaffold Q þ S and the data from each gel section from each 
lane were combined into one file. Gene ontology analysis was performed using 
GeneGo (Thomson Reuters). </p>

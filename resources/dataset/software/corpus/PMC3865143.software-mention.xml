<p>and negatively correlated with fatigue (r=−0.43 to −0.68) and 
sleepiness (r=−0.38 to −0.55). However, none of the three 
factors of flow showed any significant correlations with PVT 
indices (median reaction time and lapses). Median PVT was 
significantly and positively correlated with fatigue (r=0.35) 
and sleepiness (r=0.37). Median PVT and lapses were 
strongly correlated with each other (r=0.91). </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>The present study reveals that all aspects of flow experience 
(confidence, challenge, and immersion) decrease after sleep 
deprivation. In addition, flow indices were significantly 
and negatively correlated with fatigue (r=−0.43 to −0.68) 
and sleepiness (r=−0.38 to −0.55). These results suggest 
that sleep/sleepiness is an important factor in flow experi-
ence, and maintaining a low level of sleepiness is essential 
in order to induce flow. To the best of our knowledge, </p>

<p>the relationship between sleep loss and flow experience has 
not been previously examined. 
Consistent with previous studies, positive mood (vital-
ity) was reduced and negative mood (sleepiness, fatigue, 
confusion, anger) was increased after sleep deprivation. 19,31-34 
Importantly, this study found that flow experience and vitality 
were positively related (r=0.45 to 0.57). The results support 
our assumption based on the cognitive energy model 11,12 that 
lower levels of cognitive energy, due to sleep deprivation, 
reduce the motivation to engage in challenging tasks and 
hence impede flow experience. This is consistent with another 
report in which sleep deprivation was found to impede con-
centration and creative thinking. 35 
In the present study, confusion and anxiety ratings 
increased after sleep loss, although the result for anxiety 
did not reach statistical significance (P=0.07). These results 
are consistent with previous studies reporting that 36 hours 
of prolonged wakefulness increases self-reported anxiety 
on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaire. 36 It has 
been reported that panic attacks are more likely to occur 
in insomniacs, 22 and this may be related to deterioration in 
mood due to sleep loss. 
There were no significant correlations between flow 
indices and PVT performances. This suggests that flow may 
not influence basic cognitive ability as reflected in simple 
reaction skills. The present study used PVT because it is sen-
sitive to sleep loss. A number of other performance tasks have 
been developed and tested to evaluate the effect of sleep loss; 
these include the Stroop task, 16 switching task, 13 visual search 
task, 37 and a working memory task. 38 However, these tasks 
are less associated with sleep deprivation than with PVT, 39 </p>

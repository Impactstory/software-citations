<p>One of key issues in studying iron based superconductors is to understand how the magnetic phase of the 
parent compounds evolves. Here we report the systematic investigation of paramagnetic to 
antiferromagnetic and tetragonal to orthorhombic structural transitions of ''122'' SrFe 2 As 2 parent 
compound using combined high resolution synchrotron Mössbauer spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction 
techniques in a cryogenically cooled high pressure diamond anvil cell. It is found that although the two 
transitions are coupled at 205 K at ambient pressure, they are concurrently suppressed to much lower 
temperatures near a quantum critical pressure of approximately 4.8 GPa where the antiferromagnetic state 
transforms into bulk superconducting state. Our results indicate that the lattice distortions and magnetism 
jointly play a critical role in inducing superconductivity in iron based compounds. </p>

<p>environments. This sheds new light on the interplay of the lattice 
distortions and magnetism in the origin of superconductivity in the 
iron-based superconductors at high pressures and low temperatures. </p>

<p>Results 
SMS spectra were collected up to 5.4 GPa and temperatures as low as 
15 K, while XRD patterns were measured up to 8.2 GPa and 13 K 
(Figs. 1, 2). Fig. 1(a) shows representative pressure-dependent </p>

SMS spectra of SrFe 2 As 2 at 15 K. At 1.4 GPa and 15 K, the drastic 
appearance of quantum beats manifests the splitting of 
57 Fe nuclear 
level through hyperfine interaction, showing the AFM state. As pres-
sure was increased to 4.3 GPa, the SMS spectrum changed signifi-
cantly with the disappearance of the quantum beats, indicating that 
the magnetic phase had been suppressed via applied pressure at 15 K 
while the PM state started to appear. Since the spectrum could not be 
reasonably fitted using only paramagnetic or magnetic phases, both 
paramagnetic and magnetic phases were used to model the SMS 
spectrum at 4.3 GPa. Analyses of the modeled results showed that 
the magnetic phase accounts for approximately 42 vol.% of the two 
phases. At a higher pressure of approximately 5.4 GPa, the 
57 Fe 
nuclear level is characterized by flat spectral features without any 
splitting quantum beats, indicating the sole existence of the PM state 
with the completely suppressed magnetism by pressure. The derived 
hyperfine parameters show an abrupt increase in the strength of the 
magnetic fields as a function of temperature at a given pressure 
(Fig. 1(b)). For example, at 2.5 GPa the hyperfine magnetic field </p>

PM state. (b) Derived hyperfine magnetic fields of the AFM SrFe 2 As 2 as a

jumped to 6.7 T from zero as temperature was decreased to 160 K 
and then remains almost constant, indicating a PM to AFM trans-
ition. As pressure increases (Fig. 1(b)), the hyperfine magnetic field 
decreases and the magnetic transition region slightly broadens, 
implying suppressed magnetism by applied pressure; magnetism 
was totally suppressed at 5.1 GPa at each given low temperature as 
shown in Fig. 1(c). 
In order to clarify the relationship between the structural and 
magnetic transitions, we have also performed XRD experiments 
under high pressures and low temperatures (Figs. 2). Analyses of 
the high-pressure XRD spectra showed that the (220) reflection of 
the tetragonal phase splits to (400) and (040) reflections that are 
characteristic of the tetragonal to orthorhombic structural transition 
in SrFe 2 As 2 with decreasing temperature at a given pressure </p>

<p>. 
Similar to the magnetic transition, this structural transition is 
strongly suppressed by pressure (Fig. 2(a)). At a constant temper-
ature of 13 K, derived lattices parameters in Fig. 2(b) show the exist-
ence of the orthorhombic phase (space group: Fmmm) below 4 GPa 
and the tetragonal phase (space group: I4/mmm) above 6 GPa, 
respectively, whereas there is a P-T region between 4 GPa and 
6 GPa, in which the tetragonal and orthorhombic phases coexist. 
With increasing pressure, the orthorhombic phase observed in the 
region is suppressed while the abundance of the tetragonal phase is 
enhanced (Fig. 2(c)). 
Combining our synchrotron SMS and XRD results (Figs. 1-2) 
with literature high T c studies, we have constructed the structural, 
magnetic, and superconducting phase diagram of SrFe 2 As 2 under 
high pressures and low temperatures (Fig. 3). The magnetic trans-
ition temperature (T N ) was defined as the mid-point between the first 
appearance of the hyperfine magnetic field and the last appearance of </p>

<p>the paramagnetic phase, while the structural transition temperature 
(T S ) was defined as the mid-point from the pure tetragonal to the 
pure orthorhombic structural phase transition; for the co-existence 
of the tetragonal and orthorhombic phases at 13 K, the T S is defined 
as the point of disappearance for the orthorhombic phase. At ambi-
ent pressure, previous studies showed that the structural transition 
concurs with the magnetic transition </p>

<p>10,11 </p>

<p>. Our results here further 
show that, within experimental uncertainties, these two transitions 
are strongly coupled at high pressures and low temperatures (Fig. 3), 
except the P-T region overlap starting with the T c dome where an 
extended P-T region of the two-phase coexistence was observed (see 
further details in Discussions). These transition temperatures 
decrease with increasing pressures up to approximately 4.6 GPa, 
but are drastically suppressed to zero at a quantum critical pressure 
(P C ) of 4.8 GPa. </p>

<p>Discussions 
As discussed in the previous studies of the ''122'' system, differential 
stress can strongly affect the critical pressure in the BaFe 2 As 2 and 
SrFe 2 As 2 compounds </p>

<p>29-31 </p>

<p>. In order to draw a more direct, meaningful 
comparison with literature results, our structural and magnetic 
results are plotted on top of the superconducting transition from 
Ref. </p>

<p>, which reported electrical resistivity and ac magnetic suscept-
ibility measurements using a relatively hydrostatic glycerin medium 
that is similar in hydrostaticity to Ne medium used in our experi-
ments. Comparisons of these results show that filamentary super-
conductivity with zero resistivity emerges with the occurrence of the 
tetragonal phase co-existing with the orthorhombic phase in the 
AFM state at around 4.2 GPa and 13 K. Our results also imply that 
filamentary superconductivity can only coexist with the partial mag-
netism in the mixed tetragonal and orthorhombic region in the 
SrFe 2 As 2 at temperatures below 28 K and pressures between 4.2 
and 4.8 GPa as shown in the filled purple region in Fig. 3. 
Furthermore, bulk superconductivity, as observed by an anomaly 
in the field cooling (FC) magnetic susceptibility, only appears in 
the P-T region with the tetragonal phase in the PM state, where 
the T S and T N transitions are fully suppressed. Based on both dif-
fraction and Mössbauer results, the volume fraction of the AFM 
orthorhombic phase as a function of pressure appears to be inversely 
proportional to the high T c (Figs. 2 and 3), further supporting the 
notion that the superconductivity is partially suppressed by the exist-
ence of magnetism in the AFM orthorhombic phase. Thus we assume 
the presence of an AFM quantum critical point (QCP) near the AFM 
phase boundary. Previous NMR experiments indicate an antiferro-
magnetic fluctuation associated with QCP has strong correlation 
with the high-T c superconductivity in chemically-doped BaFe 2 As 2 
compounds </p>

nect with the superconductivity in the iron based compound. </p>

<p>. XRD analyses of the synthesized samples showed lattice 
parameters of a 5 3.9234(3) Å and c 5 12.371(2) Å at ambient conditions. A sample 
measuring 15 mm thick and 70 mm big was loaded into a symmetric DAC using Ne as 
the pressure medium, together with three ruby spheres for pressure calibration at low 
temperatures. The pressure of the sample chamber was controlled using a membrane 
diaphragm. A helium flow cold-finger cryostat was used to cool down the DAC to as 
low as 10 K; temperatures of the DAC were equilibrated after each cooling and were 
measured using two thermocouples attached to each side of the DAC. Temperature 
uncertainties were less than 5 K. SMS measurements with a resonant energy (E 0 ) of

smaller to the symbols, whereas temperature uncertainties are less than 5 K. </p>

the same cryostat with the same temperature thermocouples and membrane 
controller were used in both experiments. Two types of XRD experiments were 
conducted: decreasing temperatures at a constant pressure with an x-ray wavelength 
of 0.4072 Å ; increasing pressures at a constant temperature of 50 K or 13 K with 
an x-ray wavelength of 0.3737 Å . Diffraction patterns were collected by a MAR345

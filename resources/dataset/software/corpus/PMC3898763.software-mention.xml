<p>OBJECTIVE </p>

<p>Severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with poorer gly-
cemic control in type 2 diabetes. It is not known whether obstructive events 
during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep have a different metabolic impact com-
pared with those during non-REM (NREM) sleep. Treatment of OSA is often limited 
to the first half of the night, when NREM rather than REM sleep predominates. We 
aimed to quantify the impact of OSA in REM versus NREM sleep on hemoglobin 
A 1c (HbA 1c ) in subjects with type 2 diabetes. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS </p>

<p>All participants underwent polysomnography, and glycemic control was assessed 
by HbA 1c . </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>Our analytic cohort included 115 subjects (65 women; age 55.2 6 9.8 years; BMI 
34.5 6 7.5 kg/m </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>). In a multivariate linear regression model, REM apnea-hypopnea 
index (AHI) was independently associated with increasing levels of HbA 1c (P = 
0.008). In contrast, NREM AHI was not associated with HbA 1c (P = 0.762). The mean 
adjusted HbA 1c increased from 6.3% in subjects in the lowest quartile of REM AHI 
to 7.3% in subjects in the highest quartile of REM AHI (P = 0.044 for linear trend). 
Our model predicts that 4 h of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) use 
would leave 60% of REM sleep untreated and would be associated with a decrease 
in HbA 1c by approximately 0.25%. In contrast, 7 h of CPAP use would cover more 
than 85% of REM sleep and would be associated with a decrease in HbA 1c by as 
much as 1%. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS </p>

<p>In type 2 diabetes, OSA during REM sleep may influence long-term glycemic 
control. The metabolic benefits of CPAP therapy may not be achieved with the 
typical adherence of 4 h per night. </p>

<p>In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention reported that nearly 
26 million American adults, 8.3% of the 
population, had type 2 diabetes (1). The 
alarming increase in overweight and 
obesity has played a pivotal role in the 
rise of type 2 diabetes prevalence. The 
obesity epidemic has also been 
associated with an increased prevalence 
of sleep disturbances, particularly 
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (2,3). 
Over the past decade, both laboratory 
and epidemiologic studies have 
identified poor sleep quality and OSA as 
putative novel risk factors for type 2 
diabetes (4-6). OSA is a treatable 
chronic sleep disorder characterized by 
recurrent episodes of complete (apnea) 
or partial (hypopnea) obstruction of the 
upper airway. OSA leads to intermittent 
hypoxemia and hypercapnia, increased 
oxidative stress, cortical microarousals, 
sleep fragmentation, and chronic sleep 
loss. Indeed, prevalence estimates of 
OSA, defined as apnea-hypopnea index 
(AHI) $5 events per hour, in nondiabetic 
obese adults have ranged from 50 to 
68% (7,8). </p>

<p>In recent years, evidence has 
accumulated to indicate that OSA is 
both a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and 
an exceptionally frequent comorbidity 
with an adverse impact on glycemic 
control. Five independent studies, 
totaling nearly 1,400 patients with type 
2 diabetes, have shown that the 
prevalence of OSA (assessed by 
polysomnography [PSG]) ranges 
between 58 and 86% (9,10). Several 
studies have established a robust 
associationdindependent of adiposity 
and other known confoundersdbetween 
the presence and severity of OSA and 
insulin resistance and glucose 
intolerance in nondiabetic adults 
(11-14). Two studies that used the gold 
standard of in-laboratory PSG to 
accurately quantify the severity of OSA 
reported a robust association between 
increasing OSA severity and increasing 
levels of hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ) in 
patients with type 2 diabetes, after 
controlling for multiple potential 
confounders (9,15). While the findings of 
these two studies suggested that the 
effective treatment of OSA may be a 
nonpharmacologic strategy to improve 
glucose control, the results of the only </p>

<p>randomized, placebo-controlled clinical 
trial examining the impact of continuous 
positive airway pressure (CPAP) 
treatment on HbA 1c in patients with 
type 2 diabetes were surprisingly 
disappointing (16). One potential reason 
for the failure of OSA treatment to 
improve chronic glycemic control in 
patients with type 2 diabetes is 
insufficient CPAP use. Notably, the mean 
nightly CPAP use in this clinical trial was 
3.6 h. As most of rapid eye movement 
(REM) sleep occurs in the early morning 
hours before habitual awakening, one 
possibility is that with suboptimal 
adherence to CPAP therapy, obstructive 
apneas and hypopneas during REM sleep 
were disproportionately untreated 
compared with events in non-REM 
(NREM) sleep. This may be relevant to 
glycemic control because it is now well 
established that compared with NREM 
sleep, REM sleep is associated with 
greater sympathetic activity in healthy 
subjects as well as in patients with OSA 
(17-19). Further, compared with 
events in NREM sleep, obstructive 
apneas and hypopneas during REM 
sleep last nearly 30 s longer and are 
associated with significantly larger 
oxygen desaturation (20-22). 
Therefore, obstructive events during 
REM sleep, as compared with NREM 
sleep, may have a larger adverse effect 
on insulin release and action. This issue 
has major clinical implications for the 
duration of CPAP use that is needed to 
reverse the negative consequences of 
OSA on glycemic control in type 2 
diabetes. We have therefore 
performed a detailed analysis 
comparing the contributions of NREM 
versus REM OSA to glycemic control as 
assessed by levels of HbA 1c in a large 
cohort of adults with type 2 diabetes. </p>

<p>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS </p>

<p>Participants </p>

<p>We prospectively recruited subjects 
with established type 2 diabetes using 
an advertisement posted in the primary 
care and endocrinology clinics at the 
University of Chicago, inviting 
participation in a research study on 
sleep and diabetes. Eligible individuals 
had to meet the criteria for type 2 
diabetes based on physician diagnosis 
using standard criteria (23). In order to 
include individuals with newly </p>

<p>diagnosed type 2 diabetes, we also 
recruited in the community using an 
advertisement inviting subjects at risk 
for type 2 diabetes based on age and 
adiposity to participate in a research 
study on sleep and metabolism. All 
participants without an established 
diagnosis of type 2 diabetes had to 
undergo a standard 75-g oral glucose 
tolerance test and meet the American 
Diabetes Association guidelines for the 
diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (23). </p>

<p>All participants were in stable condition 
and, when on pharmacological 
treatment, on a stable antidiabetic 
medication regimen for the preceding 
3 months. Exclusion criteria were 
unstable cardiopulmonary conditions, 
neurological disorders, psychiatric 
disease, shift work, chronic insomnia, or 
any prior or current treatment for OSA 
(upper airway surgery, CPAP therapy, 
oral appliances, or supplemental 
oxygen). We previously reported the 
association of OSA severity categories 
(no, mild, moderate, and severe OSA) 
with chronic glycemic control in type 2 
diabetes using 60 of the participants 
included in this analysis (9). </p>

<p>The study was approved by the 
University of Chicago Institutional 
Review Board, and all participants gave 
written informed consent. </p>

<p>Experimental Protocol </p>

<p>Subjects were admitted to the Clinical 
Resource Center or the Sleep Research 
Laboratory of the Sleep, Health, and 
Metabolism Center at the University of 
Chicago to undergo an overnight in-
laboratory PSG. Height and weight were 
measured in all participants. Self-
reported ethnicity-based diabetes risk 
was categorized as low-risk category 
(non-Hispanic whites) and high-risk 
category (African Americans, Hispanics, 
and Asians). The duration of type 2 
diabetes and the number of medications 
were verified by questionnaires as well 
as review of the patients' medical 
records. Insulin use was defined as the 
current use of insulin by subject's 
report. HbA 1c was used as clinical 
indicator of glycemic control. HbA 1c 
values (defined as the proportion of 
hemoglobin that is glycosylated) were 
obtained from the patient's chart if 
assessed during the previous three </p>

<p>356 REM OSA and Type 2 Diabetes 
Diabetes Care Volume 37, February 2014 </p>

<p>months (n = 17,15% of subjects) or 
measured on a single blood sample 
drawn on the morning after the PSG 
(n = 98, 85% of the subjects). HbA 1c was 
measured by Bio-Rad variant classic 
boronate affinity-automated high-
performance liquid chromatography 
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The intra-assay 
coefficient of variation was 0.5-1.0%, 
and the interassay coefficient of 
variation was 2.2-2.4%. </p>

<p>PSG </p>

<p>Bedtimes were from 11:00 P.M.-12:00 A.M. 
until 7:00 A.M.-8:00 A.M. Each subject was 
recorded for a minimum of 7 h to 
determine the presence and severity of 
obstructive respiratory events across the 
entire night. PSG (Neurofax EEG 1100 
system, Nihon Kohden, Foothill Ranch, 
CA) included recordings of six 
electroencephalographic channels, 
bilateral electro-oculograms, chin 
and tibialis electromyogram, 
electrocardiogram, airflow by nasal 
pressure transducer and oronasal 
thermocouples, chest and abdominal 
wall motion by piezo electrode belts, and 
oxygen saturation by finger pulse 
oximeter. All PSGs were staged and 
scored according to the 2007 American 
Academy of Sleep Medicine Manual for 
the Scoring of Sleep and Related Events 
(24). Apneas were defined as total 
cessation of airflow for at least 10 s 
(obstructive if respiratory effort was 
present and central if respiratory effort 
was absent). Hypopneas were scored if 
the magnitude of the ventilation signal 
decreased by at least 50% of the baseline 
amplitude of the nasal pressure 
transducer for at least 10 s and were 
associated with either a 3% or greater 
drop in oxygen saturation as measured 
by finger pulse oximetry or an electro-
encephalographic microarousal (24). 
The total AHI was defined as the number 
of obstructive apneas and obstructive 
hypopneas per hour of sleep. Given 
the minimal presence of central 
apneas, we did not include these 
events in the calculation of AHI. The 
median central apnea index was 0.001 
(interquartile range of 0.001-0.41), and 
the highest central apnea index was 5. 
OSA was defined as AHI $5. Severity of 
OSA was measured by the AHI. A 
subject was considered to have mild OSA 
if the AHI was 5-14, moderate OSA if the </p>

<p>AHI was 15-29, and severe OSA if the AHI 
was $30. REM AHI was calculated as the 
number of apneas and hypopneas during 
REM sleep divided by total time in REM 
sleep in hours. NREM AHI was calculated 
by dividing the number of apneas and 
hypopneas during NREM sleep by total 
time in NREM sleep in hours. The oxygen 
desaturation index (ODI) was defined as 
the total number of oxygen desat-
urations of at least 3% per total 
sleep time (TST) in hours. The micro-
arousal index (MAI) was calculated as 
the total number of microarousals per 
hour of sleep. ODI and MAI were also 
calculated during REM and NREM sleep. </p>

<p>Statistical Analysis </p>

<p>Continuous variables are presented as 
mean 6 SD or median and interquartile 
ranges. Differences between subjects 
with and without OSA were tested using 
the Student t test or Mann-Whitney 
nonparametric test for continuous 
variables. Categorical variables were 
reported as proportions and were 
compared using the x square test or 
Fisher's exact test. All tests of 
significance were two sided. </p>

<p>Five multivariate linear models were 
successively fitted to examine 
associations between HbA 1c and 
measures of OSA severity after 
controlling for multiple covariates. 
Model 1 included demographic 
variables traditionally associated with 
glycemic control, namely, age, sex, 
ethnicity-based diabetes risk, BMI, years 
of type 2 diabetes, and insulin use. 
Model 2 included all the covariates in 
model 1 plus total AHI. Model 3 included 
all the covariates in model 1 plus NREM 
AHI. Model 4 included all the covariates 
in model 1 plus REM AHI. Lastly, model 5 
included all the covariates in model 1 
plus NREM AHI and REM AHI. Since 
there are individuals who have 
a significant number of apneas and 
hypopneas during REM sleep while 
having an overall AHI below 5 (hence no 
OSA based on current definitions), we 
included all 115 subjects (with or 
without OSA) in the multivariate 
regression models in order to explore 
the entire spectrum of REM and NREM 
events (AHI, ODI, and MAI). We formally 
ruled out any evidence of collinearity 
among the variables entered in the 
models using standard statistics, </p>

<p>including "tolerance" and "variance 
inflation factor" (<rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS Statistics</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">v20</rs>, 
<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">IBM, Armonk, NY</rs>). Values for HbA 1c , 
years of type 2 diabetes, and REM and 
NREM AHI were submitted to natural log 
(Ln) transformation. In order to deal 
with zero values, the total AHI, REM AHI, 
and NREM AHI were log transformed 
using the formula AHI = log(AHI + 0.01). 
A similar procedure was used for years 
of type 2 diabetes. We used casewise 
diagnostics to identify any outliers. Only 
one outlier was identified (low HbA 1c ), 
and sensitivity analysis excluding this 
subject was performed confirming the 
association between HbA 1c and 
measures of REM OSA severity. 
Goodness of fit of the models was 
assessed using diagnostic plots. </p>

<p>In order to estimate the effect size of 
increasing severity of OSA on HbA 1c in a 
clinically useful manner, models were 
fitted to estimate the change in adjusted 
HbA 1c based on quartiles of REM and 
NREM AHI. The models included all the 
covariates in model 5 (age, sex, ethnicity-
based diabetes risk, BMI, years of type 2 
diabetes, and insulin use) and replaced 
LnREM AHI with REM AHI quartiles while 
keeping LnNREM AHI in the model. This 
process was repeated, and LnNREM AHI 
was replaced with NREM AHI quartiles 
while keeping LnREM AHI in the model. 
Similar models were fitted for REM and 
NREM ODI and MAI quartiles. </p>

<p>To simulate the impact of various 
durations of nocturnal CPAP therapy on 
HbA 1c , we calculated the mean profiles of 
cumulative minutes of REM and NREM 
sleep over 8 h of total recording time from 
the 115 polysomnograms. We then 
estimated mean percentages of REM and 
NREM sleep left untreated after 4, 6, and 
7 h of optimal CPAP treatment eliminating 
all events. For each duration of CPAP use, 
we entered the number of REM and 
NREM obstructive events left untreated 
in a regression model predicting HbA 1c 
after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity-
based diabetes risk, BMI, years of type 2 
diabetes, and insulin use. </p>

<p>All statistical analyses were performed 
using <rs id="software-1" type="software">SPSS</rs> Statistics <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">v20</rs> and verified 
using <rs id="software-2" type="software">Stata</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">v10.1</rs>, College Station, TX). </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>Inclusion criteria were met in 141 
participants. Ten participants declined </p>

<p>care.diabetesjournals.org 
Grimaldi and Associates 357 </p>

<p>to undergo in-laboratory PSG. 
Therefore, the study was completed by 
131 participants. Those who obtained 
less than 4 h of TST during the PSG were 
not included in the analysis (n = 7). 
Participants were also excluded if the 
PSG data could not be interpreted due 
to multiple artifacts in the airflow signal 
(n = 8). One patient showed severe 
oxygen desaturation not explained by 
apneas or hypopneas consistent with 
significant hypoventilation. Thus the 
final analytic cohort included 115 
subjects with type 2 diabetes. </p>

<p>The demographic and clinical 
characteristics of our cohort are 
summarized in Table 1. Of the 115 
subjects included in the study, 56.5% 
were women, 58.3% were African 
American, 68.7% were obese, and the 
mean BMI was 34.5 kg/m 
2 . The median 
duration of type 2 diabetes was 4 years, 
and a quarter of the subjects were not 
on any antidiabetic medication. At least 
one type of diabetes complication was 
present in 33% of the subjects (i.e., 
neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, 
coronary artery disease, or peripheral 
arterial disease). OSA was present in </p>

<p>85.2% of the participants. Mild OSA was 
present in 27%, moderate OSA in 28.7%, 
and severe OSA in 29.6% of the subjects. 
There were no significant differences in 
sex, race, BMI, years of type 2 diabetes, 
number of antidiabetic medications, 
insulin use, and HbA 1c level between 
subjects with and without OSA, but 
participants without OSA were on 
average 9 years younger than those with 
OSA. The lack of statistically significant 
differences in BMI and HbA 1c may have 
been related to the small number 
of subjects without OSA. The 
polysomnographic findings in our 
cohort are summarized in Sup-
plementary Table 1. There were no 
significant differences in total recording 
time and percentage of slow wave sleep 
between subjects with and without 
OSA. However, subjects with OSA had 
significantly less TST and percentage of 
REM sleep and significantly higher wake 
after sleep onset. Within the 
participants with OSA (n = 98), REM AHI, 
REM ODI, and REM MAI were all 
significantly higher than NREM AHI, 
NREM ODI, and NREM MAI. The ODI was 
more than fourfold higher during REM </p>

<p>than NREM sleep, but differences in MAI 
were more modest. </p>

<p>Table 2 describes the results of the five 
multivariate linear regression models 
predicting HbA 1c . Model 1 dem-
onstrates the association of HbA 1c 
with nonsleep variables. In model 2, the 
total AHI was significantly associated 
with higher HbA 1c (P = 0.019). Model 3 
shows that NREM AHI was not associ-
ated with HbA 1c (P = 0.070). In contrast, 
in model 4, REM AHI was independently 
associated with HbA 1c (P = 0.001). In 
model 5, REM AHI (P = 0.008) 
remained a significant predictor of 
HbA 1c even after adjusting for NREM 
AHI (P = 0.762). In the final fully adjusted 
model 5, the independent predictors of 
increased HbA 1c were REM AHI (P = 
0.008), race risk (P = 0.001), years of 
type 2 diabetes (P = 0.001), and insulin 
use (P , 0.001). Age, sex, BMI, and 
NREM AHI were not significant. Similar 
results were obtained when NREM AHI 
and REM AHI were replaced by the total 
number of events in NREM and REM 
sleep, respectively (P = 0.023 for REM 
events and P = 0.355 for NREM events). </p>

<p>In order to estimate the effect size of 
increasing levels of REM AHI and NREM 
AHI on HbA 1c , we performed multivariate 
linear regression models using quartiles 
of REM AHI and NREM AHI. As can be 
seen in Fig. 1, after adjustment for age, 
sex, BMI, race risk, years of type 2 
diabetes, insulin use, and LnNREM AHI, 
increasing quartiles of REM AHI were 
significantly associated with increasing 
levels of HbA 1c (P = 0.044 for linear trend). 
The mean adjusted HbA 1c increased from 
6.3% in subjects with REM AHI ,12.3 
events per hour (lowest quartile) to 7.3% 
in subjects with REM AHI .47 events per 
hour (highest quartile). Similarly, 
quartiles of REM ODI and REM MAI were 
significantly associated with increasing 
levels of HbA 1c . The mean adjusted HbA 1c 
increased from 6.5% in the lowest 
quartile of REM ODI to 7.5% in the highest 
quartile (P = 0.039 for linear trend). 
Similarly, the mean adjusted HbA 1c 
increased from 7.6% in the lowest 
quartile of REM MAI to 8.9% in the 
highest quartile (P = 0.003 for linear 
trend). In contrast, increasing levels of 
NREM AHI, NREM ODI, and NREM MAI 
quartiles were not associated with HbA 1c 
(Fig. 1). </p>

<p>358 REM OSA and Type 2 Diabetes 
Diabetes Care Volume 37, February 2014 </p>

<p>Figure 2A illustrates the predominance 
of REM sleep in the later part of sleep. In 
our cohort, 3 and 4 h after lights off, on 
average only 25 and 40% of REM sleep 
had occurred, respectively. Therefore, 
optimally titrated CPAP use for 3 or 4 h 
would treat only 25 or 40% of REM 
sleep, respectively, and would leave 
most obstructive events during REM 
sleep untreated. Figure 2B and C 
illustrate the simulated impact of 4, 6, 
and 7 h of CPAP use in men and women 
with low and high race/ethnicity-based 
diabetes risk. This simulation clearly 
shows that the metabolic benefit of 4 h 
of CPAP use, often considered as 
adequate CPAP compliance, is modest, 
while a much more clinically significant 
effect can be obtained when treatment 
is extended to 6 h and beyond. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS </p>

<p>This study reveals that HbA 1c , a measure 
of chronic glycemic control in patients 
with type 2 diabetes, is adversely 
associated with obstructive apneas and 
hypopneas that occur in REM sleep 
(REM AHI) but not in NREM sleep (NREM 
AHI). The independent association 
between REM AHI, REM ODI, and REM 
MAI and HbA 1c is robust and of clinical 
significance, with a difference of 1.0% 
HbA 1c between the lowest and highest 
quartiles of REM AHI as well as REM ODI 
and of 1.3% HbA 1c between the lowest 
and highest quartiles of REM MAI after 
adjusting for all the covariates. These 
effect sizes are comparable to what 
would be expected from widely used 
antidiabetic medications. </p>

<p>The severity of OSA in our cohort was 
greater in REM sleep than in NREM sleep, 
as evidenced by a higher AHI and a nearly 
fourfold higher ODI. Thus, despite the 
shorter duration of REM sleep, exposure 
to the adverse consequences of OSA, 
particularly intermittent hypoxemia, was 
greater during REM than NREM sleep. 
Surprisingly, in our diabetic participants 
with OSA, NREM AHI only predicted 
approximately 25% of the variance of 
REM AHI. Whether hyperglycemia plays a 
role in this relative independence of the 
severity of REM OSA relative to NREM 
OSA remains to be determined. </p>

<p>Multiple mechanistic pathways are 
likely to be involved in the link between 
REM OSA and poorer glycemic control in </p>

<p>Figure 1-Adjusted mean HbA 1c values for REM and NREM AHI, ODI, and MAI quartiles. For all the panels, multivariate linear regression models were 
fitted to estimate the mean natural Ln HbA 1c adjusted for demographic variables traditionally associated with glycemic control such as age, sex, 
ethnicity-based diabetes risk, BMI, Ln years of type 2 diabetes, and insulin use. In addition, panels are adjusted for (A) LnNREM AHI, (B) LnREM AHI, 
(C) LnNREM ODI, (D) LnREM ODI, (E) LnNREM MAI, and (F) LnREM MAI. Age and BMI are centered at their means: 55 years old and 35 kg/m 
2 , 
respectively. The corresponding b-coefficients for each quartile were then exponentiated to convert from Ln HbA 1c to the standard values of HbA 1c .

<p>360 REM OSA and Type 2 Diabetes 
Diabetes Care Volume 37, February 2014 </p>

<p>subjects with type 2 diabetes. When 
compared with NREM sleep or quiet 
wakefulness, REM sleep is associated 
with increased sympathetic activation 
and reduced vagal tone in normal 
subjects and even more so in patients 
with OSA (17-19). Most endocrine organs 
releasing hormones involved in glucose 
regulation are sensitive to changes in 
sympathovagal balance. Well-
documented examples relevant to </p>

<p>metabolic risk are pancreatic insulin 
secretion, hepatic glucose production, 
and adipocyte regulation of energy 
balance (25-27). In addition, peptidergic 
factors originating from the intestine 
(glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-
dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) 
augment the insulin response induced by 
nutrients. The secretion of these incretin 
hormones is intimately linked to 
autonomous nervous system (28-30). </p>

<p>However, it is important to point out that 
the impact of OSA on sympathetic 
activation in patients with type 2 diabetes 
of long duration remains unclear and that 
long-standing hyperglycemia may lead to 
reduction in sympathetic activity. Lastly, 
obstructive apneas and hypopneas during 
REM sleep lead to greater degrees of 
hypoxemia than in NREM sleep (21,22). In 
the present cohort, REM ODI was indeed 
much greater than NREM ODI. </p>

<p>Figure 2-Cumulative minutes of REM and NREM sleep over 8 h of bedtime (A) and simulation of various hours of CPAP use in men and women with type 2 
diabetes based on race/ethnicity-based diabetes risk (B and C). A: Data are summarized as mean 6 SD of cumulative REM and NREM sleep minutes from 
lights off to lights on in 115 subjects with type 2 diabetes. The mean duration of REM and NREM sleep in our cohort was 82 and 298 min, respectively. Using 
CPAP for 3 or 4 h from the time lights are turned off will cover only 25 or 40% of REM sleep, respectively, and will leave most obstructive events during REM 
sleep untreated. In contrast, 7 h of CPAP use would treat 87% of REM sleep. B and C: Simulation of the impact of 4, 6, and 7 h of CPAP use in four groups of 
subjects based on sex and race/ethnicity-related diabetes risk. With this simulation, 4 h of CPAP use would treat 40% of REM sleep and would lead to a drop 
in adjusted HbA 1c of 0.23-0.28%. In contrast, 7 h of CPAP therapy would treat 87% of REM sleep and lead to a decrease in adjusted HbA 1c between 0.87 and 
1.1%. High race/ethnicity risk includes African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians. Low race/ethnicity risk includes non-Hispanic whites. </p>

<p>Intermittent hypoxemia has been shown 
to be toxic to b-cell function in murine 
models of sleep apnea (31,32). </p>

<p>The findings from our analyses strongly 
suggest that REM-related obstructive 
respiratory events are of clinical 
significance for the severity of type 2 
diabetes. Two recent studies that 
performed continuous interstitial glucose 
monitoring simultaneously with PSG 
directly support our hypothesis that REM-
related OSA may have adverse metabolic 
consequences (33,34). One of these 
studies included 13 obese patients with 
type 2 diabetes with severe OSA and 
compared them with 13 obese patients 
with type 2 diabetes without OSA with 
similar demographic characteristics. 
Although there was no difference in the 
mean diurnal glycemic level between the 
two groups, the mean glycemic level was 
38% higher during REM sleep in those 
with OSA (33). The second study included 
11 nondiabetic subjects. They found that 
in the absence of OSA, REM sleep leads 
to a larger decline in interstitial glucose 
concentration than NREM sleep. OSA 
during REM sleep abolished the expected 
decline in interstitial glucose con-
centration. In contrast, OSA during NREM 
sleep had no impact on interstitial 
glucose concentrations (34). Taken to-
gether, the evidence from studies as-
sessing interstitial glucose levels supports 
our finding that obstructive events during 
REM sleep are adversely associated with 
glucose metabolism. </p>

<p>While our participants did not meet any 
proposed definition of REM-related or 
REM-predominant OSA (35,36), our 
findings suggest that failure to recognize 
and treat OSA in REM sleep may be of 
critical clinical significance for glycemic 
control in diabetic patients. In clinical 
practice, 4 h of nightly CPAP use is 
considered adequate adherence to 
therapy (37). Indeed, a randomized 
controlled trial of CPAP therapy in 
patients with type 2 diabetes reported 
an average use of 3.6 h per night (16). 
The severity of residual OSA was not 
estimated. The disappointing results of 
CPAP trial in type 2 diabetes may reflect 
the failure to treat REM OSA due to 
insufficient CPAP use, leaving most 
obstructive events during REM sleep 
untreated. Alternatively, there may be 
other factors beyond poor CPAP </p>

<p>adherence that led to a lack of 
improvement in glycemic control such 
as a poor reserve in b-cell function. Our 
analyses show that based on the 
distribution of cumulative REM sleep in 
our cohort, CPAP therapy for the first 4 h 
after lights off would leave 60% of 
obstructive events during REM sleep 
untreated and would be associated 
with a decrease in the adjusted HbA 1c by 
only 0.25-0.28%. In contrast, 7 h of 
optimal CPAP therapy would be 
associated with a decrease in the 
adjusted HbA 1c by 0.87-1.1%. </p>

<p>Our study has several limitations. First, 
we used HbA 1c , the most commonly 
used measure in clinical practice, to 
assess glycemic control. Therefore, we 
cannot ascertain whether the mediating 
pathways linking REM AHI to HbA 1c 
involve increased insulin resistance or 
impaired b-cell function. Moreover, we 
only measured HbA 1c at a single time 
point, which was not consistently on the 
same day as PSG. However, treatment 
was stable for the preceding 3 months in 
all participants, and HbA 1c was 
measured on the morning after the PSG 
in 98 out of 115 participants (85%). 
Although HbA 1c reflects glycemic 
control 10 to 12 weeks before the assay, 
it mostly reflects glucose fluctuations 
during the last 6 weeks of the 
measurement. Despite our efforts to 
ensure treatment stability in the prior 
3 months, we cannot exclude the 
possibility that fluctuations in 
adherence to medications may have 
influenced HbA 1c levels. Our study did 
not assess associations between REM 
OSA and glucose control in subjects 
with prediabetes or normal glucose 
tolerance. We also had a large 
proportion of African Americans and 
subjects requiring little or no 
antidiabetic medications. Therefore, it 
would be important for our findings to 
be replicated in larger and more diverse 
cohorts, including participants with 
more diabetes complications and/or 
longer disease duration as well as 
individuals with prediabetes or with 
normal glucose tolerance but at high risk 
for type 2 diabetes. Also, we did not 
have a measure of habitual sleep 
duration, which may be important in 
evaluating chronic exposure to REM 
OSA, and our only measure of adiposity </p>

<p>was the BMI. Lastly, the cross-sectional 
nature of the study does not address the 
direction of causality. Indeed, only 
rigorously designed intervention 
studies will provide causal evidence 
between disordered breathing during 
REM sleep and glucose metabolism 
dysregulation. </p>

<p>In summary, our findings support the 
notion that OSA in REM sleep has a 
strong and clinically significant 
association with glycemic control in 
subjects with type 2 diabetes. Since REM 
sleep is dominant during the latter part 
of the sleep period, REM-related OSA 
may often remain untreated with 4 h of 
CPAP use. Our analyses suggest that to 
achieve clinically significant improve-
ment in glycemic control in patients 
with type 2 diabetes, CPAP use may 
need to be extended beyond 6 h per 
night. Further research is needed to 
elucidate the mechanistic pathways 
linking OSA during REM sleep and ad-
verse metabolic outcomes. </p>

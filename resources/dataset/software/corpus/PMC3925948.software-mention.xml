<p>tumor blood vessel development. To define the origin of the vascu-
lature in VHL-associated CNS hemangioblastomas and other VHL-
associated tumors, we characterized their vasculature in vitro and in 
vivo. </p>

<p>Results 
To define the vascular features of CNS hemangioblastomas, we sys-
tematically examined hemangioblastomas resected from 6 VHL 
patients and compared the features to normal cerebellum and spinal 
cord collected at autopsy from 5 patients with VHL and 3 non-VHL 
controls. CD31 expression, an endothelial specific cell surface mar-
ker, highlighted extensive vascular tissue within hemangioblastoma 
tumors (in contrast with normal cerebellum) (Fig. 1a,b). Heman-
gioblastoma precursors (defined by CA9 and HIF-2a expression in 
the absence of HIF-1a expression) 20 were identified within regions of 
normal cerebellar tissue in autopsy samples from patients with VHL 
(Fig. 1c,d,e). Both hemangioblastomas and precursor lesions demon-
strated the presence of numerous small (10 to 50 micron diameter) 
unperfused CD31 expressing ring-like vascular structures, indicative 
of sprouting vessel development with lumen formation (Fig. 1b,f). 
To better understand the anatomic relationship of the small 
unperfused intratumoral vascular structures and characterize the </p>

<p>three-dimensional (3D) structure of vasculature in VHL-associated 
tumor, we performed serial-section 3D immunohistochemical ana-
lysis of vessels in tumor. Examination of 3D CD31 expression recon-
struction in tumors demonstrated the formation of numerous small 
isolated islands of vascular tissue (10 to 50 microns) independent 
from the established vascular network (Figure 1G). To further define 
potential differences within the vasculature of VHL-associated 
tumors, we analyzed hemangioblastoma-associated vessels accord-
ing to size. Immunohistochemical analysis showed larger vessels 
(greater than 100 microns) expressed Factor VIII with or without 
CD31 expression, while small vascular structures almost exclusively 
expressed CD31. Consistent with previous studies, the absence of 
Factor VIII expression and pronounced CD31 expression in small 
vascular structures confirmed the presence of immature proliferative 
endothelial cells within hemangioblastoma tumors (Fig. 2a) 21 . 
To definitively establish the origin of the small unperfused 
vascular structures, tissue micro-dissection and extraction was per-
formed of CD31 staining endothelial cells from hemangioblastomas, 
as previously described (Fig. 2b) 10,22 . Dissected vascular elements de-
monstrated marked allelic imbalance, confirming LOH (Fig. 2b,c). 
Blood cell samples and large tumor feeding vessels did not exhibit 
LOH (Fig. 2c). To further confirm this result, FISH with concurrent </p>

CD31 immunofluorescence was carried out on hemangioblastoma 
sections to detect the presence or absence of VHL itself. Endothelial 
cell nuclei within larger vessels (100 microns) displayed retention of 
both copies of VHL (Fig. 2d). Alternatively, small vascular elements 
(10 to 50 microns) showed one copy of VHL, indicating loss of the </p>

<p>wild-type allele (Fig. 2e,f,g). Complementary LOH and FISH data 
served to verify that tumor-derived vasculogenesis was taking place 
within evaluated hemangioblastoma tumors. Large vascular struc-
tures also demonstrated some endothelial cells with loss of one copy 
of VHL, consistent with migrating endothelial cells that were 
recruited during angiogenesis combining with developing de novo 
endothelial cells during tumor blood vessel formation. 
To determine if vessels in other VHL-associated tumors were 
tumor-derived, we examined vascular elements in other VHL-assoc-
iated lesions collected at autopsy from 5 VHL patients. Micro-dis-
sected endothelial cells from RCCs, kidney cysts, and pancreatic 
tumors demonstrated characteristic VHL LOH in comparison to 
non-tumor control vessels (Fig. 3a,b). To assess the process of 
VHL-associated tumor vessel formation in vivo, subcutaneous 
implanted UMRC6 (RCC cell-line with VHL deletion) xenografts 
in NOD. Cg-Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl /SzJ mice were surgically extracted 
at 2 weeks and intratumoral vasculogenesis was analyzed (Fig. 3c). 
UMRC6 xenografts presumably demonstrated characteristic VHL-
associated tumor phenotype with extensive vascularity and clear-cell 
appearance (Fig. 3d,e). Small vascular structures developing within 
xenograft lesions were identified by CD31 staining and extracted by 
micro-dissection (Fig. 3f). Micro-dissected structures demonstrated 
human genomic (DNA) marker after amplification with VHL-flank-
ing chromosome 3 specific primers (D3S1038 and D3S1110), as 
opposed to control murine muscle tissue that did not amplify 
(Fig. 3g). Co-localization by immunofluorescence of human specific 
HLA markers and non-specific CD31 within the xenografts further 
established the presence of tumor-derived endothelial cells emerging 
within the tumor, and indicate that the hemangioblast is presumably 
the tumor cell of origin in VHL-associated tumors other than 
hemangioblastomas (Fig. 3h,i,j,k). </p>

<p>Discussion 
The hemangioblast cell has been identified as the embryologic pro-
genitor cell for both endothelial cells and erythrocytes and proposed 
as the neoplastic progenitor cell in hemangioblastomas 8-10,14 . These 
data demonstrate that VHL-associated neoplastic cells maintain the 
potential to differentiate into endothelial cells, giving direct rise to 
some tumor blood vessel development. This result should not be 
confused with recently demonstrated trans-differentiation in glio-
blastoma and the development of tumor-derived endothelial cells 
and perictyes 23-25 . The intra-and extra-embryonic mesodermally 
derived hemangioblast is the origin of coupled vasculogenesis and 
primitive erythrocyte formation during embryogenesis within the 
yolk sac and dorsal root of the aorta respectively 18 . Therefore, it is 
not difficult to conceive that tumors arising from the development-
ally arrested hemangioblast are capable of endothelial differentiation. 
Tumor progenitor hemangioblasts and RCC tumor cells, of which 
90% of sporadic cases possess biallelic VHL inactivation, are unable 
to degrade HIF 26 . Overexpression of HIF and downstream gene 
activation plays an important role in tumor proliferation, invasion, 
and angiogenesis 27 . In line with previous reports, our findings 
indicate that the embryologically arrested pVHL-deficient heman-
gioblast is the neoplastic progenitor cell in VHL-associated heman-
gioblastomas and that it also serves as the progenitor cell for other 
VHL-associated tumors (RCC). Furthermore, based upon both pre-
vious and current data, we propose that pVHL-deficient tumor cells 
develop and progress secondary to constitutively produced proan-
giogenic factors (VEGF, PDGF, EPO, and EDN1) that stimulate 
endothelial cell and erythrocyte differentiation, while also inducing 
angiogenesis within the existent tumor vascular network (Fig. 4a,b) 8,10,13 . 
In addition, de novo endothelial cells can combine with migrating 
endothelial cells recruited during angiogenesis during tumor blood 
vessel formation (Fig. 4c). However, at this time we cannot separate 
integrated tumor-derived endothelial cells from those derived during 
angiogenesis in terms of function. An in-depth understanding of </p>

CD31 staining vascular structures were micro-dissected and extracted (arrows) (a; lower row) and demonstrate LOH after amplification with D3S1038 
and D3S1110 VHL-flanking chromosome 3 primers in comparison to non-tumor control vessel (b). Surgically extracted subcutaneous UMRC6 (renal 
cell carcinoma cell-line with loss of VHL) murine xenografts were assessed for intratumoral vasculogenesis (c). H&amp;E staining of xenografts demonstrates 
sharp demarcation between human xenograft tumor cells and murine connective tissue (d), as well as characteristic VHL-associated tumor phenotype 
with the presence of clear-cells and extensive vascular tissue within the xenograft (e). Small vascular structures within the xenograft, identified through 
CD31 staining, were micro-dissected (f). Micro-dissected vessels demonstrate presence of human genomic (DNA) marker after amplification with 
D3S1038 and D3S1110, as compared to control murine muscle tissue that did not amplify (g). HLA immunofluorescence (green) clearly demarcated 
UMRC6 xenograft tumor cells from murine connective tissue cells (h). Co-localization by immunofluorescence for human-specific HLA (MHC class I A, 
B, and C) (green) and non-specific CD31 (red) confirmed the presence of human endothelial cells emerging within xenografts adjacent to invading 
murine (non-human) vascular tissue (i,j,k). Blots are cropped to enhance clarity and conciseness of presentation. </p>

vascular tumor biology in VHL-associated tumors will provide 
additional insight into cancer stem cell biology and tumor pro-
gression driven by unregulated HIF expression, as well as high-
light the importance of developing novel treatment strategies 
capable of inhibiting vascular tissue proliferation. More specif-
ically, therapies that exploit the known differentiation potential 
of the hemangioblast may offer an alternative treatment paradigm 
for CNS hemangioblastoma. </p>

<p>Methods </p>

<p>VHL tumor samples. Tumor samples were collected at the Surgical Neurology 
Branch in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) 
under an instutition-approved protocol (NIH 03-N-164). </p>

<p>Immunohistochemistry staining. Tissues were fixed in Histochoice (Amresco) with 
0.1% Triton X-100 (Research Products International). Detection of antibody was 
performed using the Vectastain ABC reagent (1550) and DAB (Vector Laboratories). 
Sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich). Primary 
antibodies were as follows: anti-CD31 (15200, Dako). </p>

<p>Immunofluorescence staining and flourescence in situ hybridization (FISH). 
Slides were fixed with Histochoice (Amresco) and labeled overnight with primary 
antibodies. Nuclei of cells were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich). Staining 
was visualized with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). Primary 
antibodies were as follows: anti-factor VIII (15200, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-CD31 
(15200, Dako), and anti-HLA Class I ABC (15200, MBL International). For 
interphase FISH analysis, BAC clone RP11-438J1 (210 kb) including the entire VHL 
gene from the 3p25.3 region was used. The VHL BAC DNA probe labeled by 
SpectrumOrange was purchased from Empire Genomics. Centromere enumeration 
probe for chromosome 3 (CEP3) labeled with SpectrumGreen was purchased from 
Abbott Molecular. FISH assays were performed on 5 micron Formalin-Fixed-
Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tumor sections using laboratory standardized protocol 
with slight modification 26 . Denaturation of target DNA on slides was carried out by 
co-denaturation of the probe and target DNA at 73uC in HYBrite (Abbott Molecular) 
for 5 min followed by overnight hybridization at 37uC. The next day, slides were 
washed at 72uC in 0.43 SSC/0.3% Tween-20 for 2 min and then in 23 SSC/0.1% 
Tween-20 at room temperature for 1 min. Slides were counterstained, mounted with 
DAPI/Antifade (Vector Laboratories) and analyzed on the BioView Duet-3 
fluorescent scanning station using 633 oil objective and DAPI/FITC/Rhodamine 
single band filters (Semrock). </p>

<p>Three-dimensional immunohistochemistry. Serial sections were cut at 8.0-mm 
thickness. After staining (anti-CD31), individual micrographs were collected and 
stacked. Images were captured using a Yokogawa spinning-disk confocal on a Nikon </p>

<p>TE2000U inverted microscope with a 1003 Plan Apo NA 1.4 objective lens, a 
Hamamatsu ORCA ER-cooled CCD camera, and <rs type="software">MetaMorph</rs> software. Image stacks 
were aligned, analyzed, and visualized using freeware <rs id="software-0" type="software">Reconstruct</rs> software 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SynapseWeb</rs>). </p>

<p>DNA extraction and loss of heterozygosity testing. Tissue dissection was performed 
as previously described 27,28 . Samples were screened for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) 
with two polymorphic markers D3S1038 and D3S1110 flanking the VHL gene as 
previously described with minor modifications 6 . </p>

<p>Cell culture and tumor xenografts. Human renal cell carcinoma cell line UMRC6 
was maintained in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (Gibco) supplemented 
with 10% fetal bovine serum and Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine 
(Gibco). Animal experiments were approved for use and care of animals under the 
protocol guidelines of the National Institutes of Health Animal Care and Use 
Committee. NOD. Cg-Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl /SzJ mice (aged 6 to 8-wk, male) were 
purchased from Jackson Laboratories. 10 7 UMRC6 cells in 200 mL PBS were injected 
subcutaneously. Tumors were excised and processed for morphological study two 
weeks after initial implantation. </p>

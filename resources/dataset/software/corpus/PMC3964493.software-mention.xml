<p>insulin resistance; factors included 
sex, presence of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, and omentectomy 
randomization status. A two-sided 
P value , 0.05 was considered significant. 
Statistical analyses were performed 
using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> software <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">v.17.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., 
Chicago, IL). BMI, fat body mass, lean 
body mass, and blood pressure 
decreased at each follow-up time point 
compared with baseline. BMI, fat body 
mass, and lean body mass decreased 
compared with the previous visit at 
6 and 12 months in post hoc analysis. 
Decreasing fat body mass and 
decreasing BMI were associated with 
increasing BNP at 12 and 24 months by 
linear mixed-effects model analysis 
(P 5 0.01 and P 5 0.02, respectively, at 
12 months; and P 5 0.01 for both 
covariates at 24 months). BNP increased 
compared with baseline at follow-up 
time points 12 and 24 months (Fig. 1). 
NT-proBNP increased at 12 months but 
trended down at 24 months (Fig. 1). 
Omentectomy had no effect on BNP or 
HTN. Given recent data showing that </p>

<p>natriuretic peptides contribute to the 
"browning" of fat tissue, resulting in 
increased energy expenditure (5), their 
role in blood pressure regulation, 
weight loss, and lipolysis in patients 
undergoing RYGB surgery invites 
further inquiry. </p>

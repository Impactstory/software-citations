<p>ABSTRACT: This study evaluates the effects of cultured wild ginseng root (0.05%, 0.1% v/w) and xylitol in kimchi. The 
fermented characteristics of kimchi were investigated during 28 days of fermentation at 4 </p>

<p>o </p>

<p>C. The pH value in the sample 
with the cultured wild ginseng root was higher than that of control group. The total acidity in the sugar groups (SG 
groups) was higher than that of xylitol groups (XG groups). Comparing total bacterial count, XG groups were lower than 
SG groups, regardless of the additional ratio of the cultured wild ginseng root. Reducing sugar of XG groups decreased 
more slowly than SG groups for seven days; glucose and fructose of XG groups were lower than the control group. DPPH 
radical scavenging activity was higher in groups with cultured wild ginseng root than in control. In the result of sensory 
evaluation, XG groups were more preferred than other groups. In conclusion, our results indicate that cultured wild-gin-
seng root and xylitol have a positive effect on the quality of kimchi, such as antimicrobial and antioxidant functions. </p>

<p>Kimchi, a traditional Korean salted and fermented vege-
table food, has an important role in the diet and nu-
trition of Koreans and has become popular throughout 
the world (1-3). Kimchi contains high levels of vitamins, 
minerals, dietary fibers, and other functional compo-
nents. The phytochemicals in kimchi have shown anti-
microbial, anticancer and antiatherosclerotic functions. 
Also, dietary fibers have been demonstrated to prevent 
hypertension, diabetes, constipation, and cancer (4). 
According to the reports of Born et al. (5) and Scheie 
et al. (6), xylitol and sorbitol are sugar alcohols and glu-
cose and maltose are saccharides substitutive for sugar 
produced by adding hydrogen to raw sugar such as 
xylose. In food processing areas, sugar alcohols provide 
functionality such as preventing dental caries and inhi-
biting the rise of blood sugar and furthermore, only 12% 
of xylitol and 84% of sorbitol are absorbed by the small 
intestine due to decomposition by bacteria. Concerning 
efforts to extend the shelf life of kimchi by adding differ-
ent types of sugars, Kim et al. (7) reported that the addi-
tion of xylose and xylitol extended the shelf life of kimchi </p>

<p>by affecting the organic acid fermentation of kimchi, 
while Moon et al. (8) reported the effects of xylitol and 
grapefruit seed extract on the sensory properties, fer-
mentation and aging of kimchi. Ku et al. (9) reported 
that the addition of sorbitol and saccharide or the addi-
tion of oligo-fructose for kimchi fermentation by bifido-
bacteria provided nutrition for kimchi lactic acid bacteria 
and consequently improved the taste and enhanced 
functionality as probiotics by increasing the survival of 
bifidobacteria, as reported by Chae and Jhon (10). Several 
studies (5-10) tried to extend the edible period of kimchi 
by adding xylitol, a kind of sugar alcohol, to Chinese 
cabbage kimchi; however, Kim et al. (7) reported that xy-
litol, which is effective in dental treatment, is not a fer-
menting sugar and therefore slows down the rate of acid 
production and extends the edible period. 
Wild ginseng (san-sam) grows naturally and is har-
vested from wherever it is found. Cultured wild ginseng 
roots are easily obtained by using a plant cell culture 
technique for the production of natural wild ginseng and 
have been shown to contain higher levels of ginseno-
sides and saponin (11,12). Jung et al. (13) confirmed 
that ginsenoside, with the development of a new proc-</p>

<p>essing method for enhancing its absorption rate, cul-
tured wild ginseng increased the content of ginsenoside 
and in particular ginsenoside Rg3 through the fermenta-
tion process of kimchi. Lee et al. (14) reported the ef-
fects of ginsenoside Rg3 such as platelet agglutination 
and immune enhancement. 
This study examined the fermented characteristics of 
kimchi using cultured wild ginseng and xylitol. In order 
to examine health functionality enhanced by the optimal 
fermentation of lactic acid bacteria and the extension of 
the edible period, we analyzed the physicochemical char-
acteristics, microbial characteristics and antioxidant abil-
ity of kimchi. The results of this study are expected to be 
useful materials for basic research on the industrializa-
tion of kimchi. </p>

<p>MATERIALS AND METHODS </p>

<p>Materials and preparation of kimchi 
Kimchi was prepared by adding xylitol and cultured wild 
ginseng. The control group was prepared by adding sug-
ar only, and the experimental groups were prepared by 
adding cultured wild ginseng (0.05% or 0.1%) to sugar 
(SG-0.05, SG-0.1), and by adding cultured wild ginseng 
(0.05% or 0.1%) to xylitol (XG-0.05, XG-0.1). All the 
materials used were Korean-produced including cultured 
wild ginseng (CBN Biotech, Chungbuk, Korea), xylitol 
(Samin Chemical Co., Gyeonggi, Korea), sugar (Daesang, 
Seoul, Korea), salt (Jeonnam, Korea), powdered red pep-
per (Chungbuk, Korea), garlic (Jeonnam, Korea), gluti-
nous rice paste, and mixture ratios showed in Fig. 1. 
The prepared kimchi was put into PE (polyethylene) 
film, kept in a refrigerator at 4 </p>

<p>o </p>

<p>C, and used as specimens </p>

<p>after different periods of storage. </p>

<p>pH, acidity and salinity 
The 100 g of sample was mixed in a blender (KA-2600, 
Kaiser, Seoul, Korea) and filtered with cheese cloth gauze 
and the filtered solution was used. The pH was meas-
ured with a pH meter (Accumet AB 15, Fisher Scientific, 
Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Ten mL of kimchi juice was ti-
trated with 0.1 N NaOH to pH 8.2 for titratable acidity. 
The titratable acidity was calculated on the basis of lactic 
acid. Five mL of filtered solution was titrated with 0.1 N 
AgNO 3 at the terminal point of browning while adding 
10% K2CrO4 by the Mohr method for salinity (15). </p>

<p>Reducing sugar 
The reducing sugar content in kimchi was measured by 
Miller's (16) colorimetry using dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS). 
DNS reagent was added to the dilute solution of kimchi, 
the mixture was stirred thoroughly, left 5 minutes for 
reaction, and cooled down. For the solution with devel-
oped color, we measured absorbance at 550 nm using a 
spectrophotometer (V-550, Jasco Co., Tokyo, Japan) and 
converted the result into glucose for presentation. </p>

<p>Free sugar content 
To measure free sugar content, kimchi was filtered with 
a 0.45 μm filter, and the filtrate was analyzed by HPLC. 
In the analysis, fructose, glucose and sucrose (Sigma 
Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) were used as stand-
ard solutions. The HPLC conditions are described in 
Table 1. </p>

ution at a ratio of 1:10, and 100 μL of the extracted sol-
ution was mixed with 2 mL of 1.5×10 
4 M DPPH 
solution. The mixture was left at room temperature for 
30 minutes and then absorbance was measured at 520 
nm using a spectrophotometer (V-570, Jasco Co.). The 
control group was also measured in the same conditions, 
and DPPH radical scavenging activity was calculated by

<p>Color values 
Color values were measured with a color meter (CR-200,

L (lightness), a (redness) and b (yellowness) and ΔE 
value was calculated with the following equation: </p>

<p>ΔE=(ΔL 2 +Δa 2 +Δb 2 ) 1/2 </p>

<p>Texture 
Kimchi added with cultured wild ginseng powder and 
xylitol at different concentrations was ripened at 4 o C 
and its texture was measured on Day 3, 14 and 28. The 
hardness of kimchi containing cultured wild ginseng was 
measured 7 times repeatedly using 3×4 cm large pieces 
taken from the midrib of kimchi with texture profile an-
alyzer (TPA; TA.XT2 Texture Analyzer, Stable Micro 
Systems, London, UK) by the method of Kim and Kim 
(18). The measuring conditions of the texture analyzer 
were: force and time mode, two bites; pre-test speed, 5.0 
mm/s; test speed, 5.0 mm/s; post-test speed, 5.0 mm/s; 
strain, 90% and 2.0 s; trigger type, auto 10 g; contact 
force, 5.0 g; probe, p/5 mm; and probe distance, 18 mm. </p>

<p>Total bacteria and lactic acid bacteria 
The kimchi (15 g from the leaf and 15 g from the stem 
of kimchi) diluted in 0.85% sterile saline step by step, 
and then inoculated by the pour plate method. The total 
bacteria were incubated for 48~72 h at 35±1 o C and the 
lactic acid bacteria for 48 h in 35±1 o C and the quantity </p>

<p>of colony was checked and express in colony forming 
unit (CFU/g). The media used for total bacteria was 
plate count agar (Difco Laboratories Inc., Detroit, MI, 
USA), the lactic acid bacterial count in MRS agar (Merck 
Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). </p>

<p>Sensory evaluation 
Kimchi added with cultured wild ginseng and xylitol at 
different concentrations fermented at 4 o C and sensory 
evaluation was performed by 19 students at the Depart-
ment of Culinary Arts of Woosong University who were 
given full explanations about the purposes and methods 
of experiment in advance. Then, the participants were 
educated to evaluate the intensity of redness, wild gin-
seng flavor, tangy taste, spicy taste, sweet taste, sour 
taste, after taste, salty taste, and hardness. Color, flavor, 
taste, texture and overall acceptability were rated on a 
9-point scale, and a high score meant high overall accep-
tability. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis 
The statistical analysis of all data was performed by 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">Ver. 12.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). The t-test, 
one-way ANOVA (one-way analysis of variance) and 
Duncan's multiple range comparison were used to find 
the level of significant differences (P&lt;0.05). </p>

<p>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION </p>

<p>pH and acidity 
In order to measure pH and acidity of kimchi added cul-
tured wild ginseng 0.05% and 0.1% (v/w) based on the 
weight of Chinese cabbage, fermented the kimchi at 4 </p>

<p>C, 
and measured the change of pH during the fermentation 
process. Initial pH was 5.85~5.89, showing no signi-
ficant difference among the specimens. With the increase 
of the fermentation period, pH decreased gradually and 
showed difference among the specimens containing cul-
tured wild ginseng. On Day 7 of fermentation, pH was 
4.92 in the control group, 4.89 in the SG groups and sig-
nificantly high as 5.0~4.95 in XG groups (Fig. 2). The 
quantity of xylitol did not make a significant difference 
in pH. This result was similar to the report of Park and 
Sohn (19) that pH of kkakdugi (radish kimchi) was not 
different according to the type of sweetener. Particu-
larly on Day 28 of storage, pH was 4.07 in the SG groups, 
which was significantly different from the XG groups 
(P&lt;0.001). 
On the other hand, with the increase of the fermenta-
tion period, acidity decreased significantly more in the 
treated groups than in the control group (P&lt;0.05). 
Previously reported, acidity of optimum ripening period 
of kimchi were 0.6~0.8% (27,28), which showed a sim-</p>

<p>ilar tendency at 14 days in this study. Acidity on that day 
was 0.68% in the control group, but significantly lower 
as 0.54% in the XG groups (P&lt;0.05), suggesting that 
the addition of xylitol extends the fermentation period 
of kimchi effectively. A similar tendency was observed 
on Day 21 and 28 at the late stage of fermentation but 
the difference was not statistically significant. The sal-
inity of kimchi was 1.78~2.28% on initial day and was 
at a similar level during fermentation. </p>

<p>Reducing sugar 
The reducing sugar contents during the fermentation pe-
riod of kimchi are shown in Fig. 3. The result of this 
study was similar to the report of Moon and Jang (20), 
whom reported a significant decrease of the reducing 
sugar content by 50% of the initial level in 7 days 
(P&lt;0.001). Because sugar is used as the food of mi-
crobes at the early stage, the reducing sugar in xyli-
tol-containing group decreased at a significantly lower 
rate. On Day 14 and 28, however, no difference among 
the groups was observed. In our study, the xylitol-con-
taining groups showed a relatively high reducing sugar 
like the control group, and was probably because sugar 
was decomposed in various types of salted-fermented 
seafood as in the report of Lee et al. (21), stating that 
part of glutinous rice paste was decomposed and formed 
sugar and, as a result, a relatively high amount of sugar 
was decomposed. </p>

<p>Free sugar 
The free sugar contents during the fermentation of 
kimchi containing cultured wild ginseng and xylitol are 
shown in Table 2. Initial fructose and glucose contents 
was 79.26~97.62 mg/mL and 60.72~75.89 mg/mL. 
Fructose and glucose contents, due to use by bacteria, </p>

<p>decreased during fermentation period. Especially, glu-
cose was reduced by more than 90% on Day 28. Total of 
fructose and glucose was the highest in control group 
during fermentation and had a close correlation with re-
ducing sugar. Initial sugar content was 34.06 mg/mL, 
decreased to 8.36 mg/mL on Day 7, and was not de-
tected from Day 14. In the XG groups, some sugar was 
detected at the early stage of fermentation probably be-
cause some of the disaccharides was detected, as sim-
ilarly reported by Lee and Kim (22) in their research on 
the decomposition of glutinous rice paste. </p>

<p>DPPH radical scavenging activity 
The DPPH radical scavenging activity in kimchi contain-
ing cultured wild ginseng and xylitol are shown in Fig. 4. 
The initial DPPH radical scavenging activity was 24.50~ 
26.93%, showing no significant differences among the 
specimens, but on Day 14 of storage, DPPH radical scav-
enging activity was significantly higher as 45.33~46.88% 
in the treated groups than in the control group (P&lt;0.05). 
This is probably because of antioxidant components such 
as saponins and ginsenoside known to be in cultured 
wild ginseng (23). Many studies are being conducted on 
the antioxidant effect of kimchi, and known antioxidant 
substances include vitamin C, β-carotene, phenolic com-
pound and chlorophyll (24). During the fermentation 
period, DPPH radical scavenging activity increased and 
reached the peak on Day 14 (optimum maturity) and de-
creased to some degree afterwards. Lee et al. (25) also 
reported that antioxidant ability was higher in optimally 
fermented kimchi. </p>

tion, and decreased significantly over the storage period 
depending on additive, and this result was consistent 
with the report of Lee and Kim (22) that L value de-
creased in kkakdugi containing hydrangea leaf extract. 
However, the significant difference of L value over the 
fermentation period was not observed in XG-0.1. Over 
the fermentation period, a value increased significantly 
in all the groups (P&lt;0.05), probably due to red color 
eluted from red pepper, and Mo et al. (26) reported a </p>

<p>similar result for kimchi containing red ginseng. As to b 
value just after preparation, no significant difference ex-
isted across all groups. On Day 14, 21 and 28, b value 
was not significantly different between the control group 
and the treated groups. </p>

<p>Texture 
The results of texture in kimchi containing cultured wild 
ginseng and xylitol are shown in Table 4. Initial hard-
ness was not significantly different among the speci-
mens. XG-0.01 was observed significantly higher hard-
ness than other kimchi. During the fermentation period, 
hardness of SG groups and control were significantly de-
creased but XG groups were similar to initial level. 
Cohesiveness was not significantly different between the 
control group and the treated groups. Gumminess was 
not significantly different between the control group and 
the XG groups. Chewiness increased over the fermenta-
tion period, which was quite similar to the results of Ku 
et al. (9), in which chewiness was somewhat higher in 
the group containing sugar alcohol sorbitol than in the 
control group. On Day 28, chewiness decreased in the 
control group and the SG-0.05 but the difference was 
not significant. Kim et al. (27) reported that the chewi-
ness of kkakdugi decreased with the increase of the edi-
ble period, but our result shows that the addition of xy-
litol extends the shelf life by increasing chewiness com-
pared to the control group. As xylitol improves the tex-
ture of kimchi in the process of fermentation, we expect </p>

<p>a texture extension effect in kimchi containing xylitol 
compared to control. </p>

<p>Total bacteria and lactic acid bacteria 
The results of total bacterial count and the lactic acid 
bacterial count in kimchi containing cultured wild gin-
seng and xylitol are shown in Table 5. The total bacterial 
count increased most on Day 14 and decreased on Day 
28 similarly to the tendency reported by Moon et al. 
(20). On Day 14, the total bacterial count was signi-
ficantly higher in the control and the SG groups than in 
the XG groups, and the same tendency was observed al-
so on Day 28. The lactic acid bacterial count just after 
preparation was 3.89~4.10 log CFU/g, and was highest 
in the SG-0.1 group. Total bacterial count of SG groups 
was higher than that of XG groups. The lactic acid bacte-
rial count reached the highest level on Day 14 showing 
optimal fermentation, and decreased significantly on 
Day 21 and 28 (P&lt;0.001). The total bacterial count of 
XG groups was lower than the SG groups but the lactic 
acid bacterial count of SG groups was not significantly 
different compared to the other groups. This is con-
sistent with the report of Chae and Jhon (10) that xylitol 
were used prebiotics in the intestines and improved the 
functionality of kimchi. </p>

<p>Sensory evaluation 
The QDA score of the color, flavor, carbohydrate taste, 
spicy taste, sweet taste, sour taste, salty taste, and tex-
ture of optimally fermented kimchi are shown in Fig. 5. 
The flavor of cultured wild ginseng was higher than in 
the control group, but spicy taste was similar regardless </p>

<p>of treatment. Sweet taste was somewhat higher in the 
SG groups, and sour taste was not different among the 
groups, suggesting that xylitol does not affect sour taste. 
The reducing sugar content was low in XG groups, but 
according to the results of sensory test in Table 6, sweet 
taste and salty taste were not significantly different, and 
carbonated taste was significantly different in the XG 
groups (P&lt;0.05). Texture was particularly higher in the 
XG groups as a substitute for sugar. In conclusion, the 
XG groups were somewhat higher than the SG groups in 
sensory preference. </p>

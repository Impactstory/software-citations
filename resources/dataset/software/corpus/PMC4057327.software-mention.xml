<p>Abstract: A functional polycation nanonetwork was developed for delivery of water soluble 
chemotherapeutic agents. The complexes of polyethyleneimine grafted methoxy polyethylene 
glycol (PEI-g-mPEG) and Zn 
2+ were utilized as the micellar template for cross-linking with </p>

<p>dithiodipropionic acid, followed by an acidic pH dialysis to remove the metal ion from the micellar 
template. The synthesis method was optimized according to pH, the molar ratio of Zn </p>

<p>2+ </p>

<p>, and the 
cross-link ratio. The atomic force microscopy showed soft, discrete, and uniform nano-networks. 
They were sensitive to the simulated reductive environment as determined by Ellman's assay. They 
showed few positive ζ potential and an average hydrodynamic diameter of 162±10 nm, which 
decreased to 49±11 nm upon dehydration. The ionic character of the nano-networks allowed the 
achievement of a higher-loading capacity of methotrexate (MTX), approximately 57% weight 
per weight, depending on the cross-link and the drug feed ratios. The nano-networks actively 
loaded with MTX presented some suitable properties, such as the hydrodynamic size of 117±16 
nm, polydispersity index of 0.22, and a prolonged swelling-controlled release profile over 24 
hours that boosted following reductive activation of the nanonetwork biodegradation. Unlike the 
PEI ionomer, the nano-networks provided an acceptable cytotoxicity profile. The drug-loaded 
nano-networks exhibited more specific cytotoxicity against human hepatocellular carcinoma 
cells if compared to free MTX at concentrations above 1 µM. The enhanced antitumor activity 
in vitro might be attributed to endocytic entry of MTX-loaded nano-networks that was found in 
the epifluorescence microscopy experiment for the fluorophore-labeled nano-networks. 
Self-assembled polymeric nanoparticles based on amphiphilic copolymers represent a 
relatively new class of nanostructures built on the bottom-up technological approach 
that has attracted considerable attention as a potential delivery vehicle, especially 
for poorly soluble drugs. 
1 Bottom-up techniques simply arrange building blocks into 
desirable nanostructures, usually spontaneously, through self-assembly. 
2 Their benefits 
include particle sizes in the range of 10-200 nm, with a fairly narrow size distribution, 
simplicity of fabrication as a consequence of the bottom-up approach, and superior 
loading of active pharmaceutical agents. </p>

<p>3   A rather new class of the polymer micelles could be prepared through the for-
mation of lyophobic complexes with the polyelectrolyte segment of an ionomer. </p>

<p>Ionomers are composed of covalently linked polyelectrolyte 
and nonionic polymers. 
4 Depending on the topology of 
linking, they can be classified as block copolymers, graft 
copolymers, and nano-networks. They behave as unim-
ers like classical polymers or polyelectrolytes in aqueous 
solution; whereas, the micellization of these ionomers can be 
induced by external stimuli, such as temperature, pH, ionic 
strength, or by the complex formation of a polyelectrolyte 
segment with oppositely charged molecules, such as synthetic 
linear polyelectrolytes, 
5,6 block ionomers, 
7 surfactants, </p>

<p>The poly ion metal complexation of ionomers has 
been used to induce the formation of polymer micelles, 
as addressed by different authors. The electrostatic neu-
tralization of carboxylate-based polyanionic segments of 
polyethylene oxide (PEO)-b-polymethacrylic acid, 
16 PEO-b-
polyacrylic acid (PAA) 
17,18 or pluronic-b-PAA, 
9,19 and alkaline 
earth metal ions, such as Ca 
2+ and Ba </p>

<p>2+   , results in spontaneous 
micellization of the copolymers. 
Alternatively, highly stable, metal-based nanoparticles 
are prepared through the formation of coordination bonds 
with transition metal ions. Complexes of hydrophilic block 
ionomers, such as PAA-b-polyhydroxyethyl acrylate, </p>

or Cu 
2+ lead to the formation of spherical assemblies with 
core-corona morphology and hydrodynamic diameters in the 
range of 25-150 nm. 
The colloidal stability of ionomer complexes is highly 
dependent on the environmental parameters, such as pH 
and ionic strength. 
23 The low structural stability of ionomer 
micelles in biological media could be problematic for their 
biomedical applications. Thus, there is an interest in the 
stabilization of ionomer micelles by introducing cross-links 
between the polymer chains, either within the core domain 
or throughout the corona layer. Bronich et al 
14,19 developed 
a procedure in which ionomer micelles were initially pre-
pared by the self-assembly of the ionic blocks of PEO-b-
polymethacrylic acid (PMA) or pluronic-PAA copolymers 
with an oppositely charged condensing agent (Ca </p>

<p>2+ </p>

<p>) that was 
followed by the chemical cross-linking of the ionic blocks in 
the core by ethylenediamine. Similarly, reversible core-cross-
linked micelles were synthesized with cystamine. </p>

<p>15   Branched polyethyleneimine (PEI) is a cationic 
polyelectrolyte that contains primary, secondary and ter-
tiary amino groups with the average pKa value between 
8.5-9. 
24 The polymer has a high content of amine nitro-
gen able to donate electrons and coordinate with transi-
tion metal ions. 
25,26 This property may be applied for the </p>

<p>immobilization of proteins and enzymes, 
27-29 anchoring 
metal nanoparticles, 
30 or drug delivery. 
31,32 Different 
authors have reported ionomer complex micelles of PEI 
grafted with methoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG) and 
anionic surfactants, 
9,33 metal ions (AuCl 3 or PtCl 6 
2-), </p>

<p>26,34   oligonucleotides, 
35 or plasmid DNA. 
36 The covalent attach-
ment of mPEG is commonly used to improve aqueous 
solubility and to reduce immunogenicity and cytotoxicity 
of polymeric systems. 
37,38 The different copolymers of PEI 
and mPEG form PEI ionomers with a hydrophilic steric 
shield, which improves the stability of the PEI complexes 
and prevents aggregation. 
39 The mPEG-grafted PEI has 
been shown to display decreased interactions with proteins, 
a reduced activation of the complement system, and an 
enhanced circulation time in the bloodstream. 
40 Moreover, 
less safety problems are associated with mPEG grafted than 
unmodified polymers in vitro and in vivo. </p>

<p>41   Methotrexate (MTX) is one of the most widely studied 
and effective therapeutic agents available to treat many 
solid tumors, hematologic malignancies, and autoimmune 
diseases; 
42 however, the poor pharmacokinetics, the nar-
row safety margin, and the impaired cellular uptake of the 
drug have limited the therapeutic outcomes of conventional 
delivery systems. Large amounts of the administrated MTX 
are eliminated by the kidneys within a short period of time, 
resulting in a short plasma half-life of 5-8 hours and a low 
drug concentration in target tissues. 
43 Increasing the dose of 
MTX may result in a higher therapeutic efficacy, but it also 
leads to a higher risk of side effects; 
44,45 moreover, MTX 
resistance appears due to impaired cellular uptake. </p>

<p>46   For an improved MTX delivery, several unique 
pathophysiological features of the diseases can be used 
either as targets or as tools for drug delivery, such as 
angiogenesis, 
47,48 enhanced permeability and retention 
(EPR) effect, 
49 acidosis, and the expression of specific 
antigens and receptors. 
50,51 Some delivery systems have 
been developed to improve the pitfalls of MTX therapy 
that ranged from polymeric conjugates, such as human 
serum albumin, liposomes, microspheres, solid lipid nano-
particles, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, polymeric 
micelles, in situ forming hydrogels, carrier erythrocyte, 
and nanotechnology-based materials, including carbon 
nanotubes, magnetic nanoparticles, and gold nanopar-
ticles. They are successful in providing a prolonged and 
nonfluctuating plasma profile or an enhanced activity in 
vitro and in vivo; nevertheless, many of them still need 
different complementary studies to fine-tune the carrier 
in terms of pharmaceutical properties, as well as safety 
and efficacy. </p>

<p>sequential optimization of methotrexate encapsulation in micellar nano-networks </p>

<p>Following our recent study on the synthesis of homo-
geneous nano-networks via the core cross-linking of the 
complexes of Zn 
2+ and the PEI ionomer and the subsequent 
removal of Zn 
2+ from the micellar template, 
53 we aimed to 
study the application of the developed carrier for the active 
encapsulation and delivery of MTX in vitro. The effect 
of different physicochemical and formulation parameters 
was investigated on colloidal (particle size distribution and 
morphology) and pharmaceutical (drug-loading and release 
kinetic) properties of the MTX-loaded nano-networks. It 
was hypothesized that the cross-linked polyamines core of 
the nano-networks can encapsulate the negatively charged 
chemotherapeutic agents, such as MTX, efficiently. 
Moreover, the redox-sensitive cross-links can provide the 
required stability of the nano-networks if they are diluted 
in the simulated extracellular medium; whereas, the break-
down of the network in the simulated reductive medium can 
promote the release of the encapsulated MTX. Finally, the 
cellular internalization of the fluorophore-labeled nanonet-
work and the in vitro cellular activity of the MTX-loaded 
nanonetwork were noticed. </p>

from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany). Deionized water 
(Direct Q UV3; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) was

<p>Template-assisted synthesis 
of nano-networks </p>

<p>The synthesis method includes the following consecutive 
steps: PEGylation of PEI; formation of the micellar template 
of Zn 
2+ and PEI ionomer; the cross-linking reaction; and 
the subsequent removal of Zn 
2+ from the micellar template 
(Figure 1). 
The ionomers composed of branched PEI and grafted 
mPEG-COOH were synthesized by carbodiimide reaction 
in the presence of triethylamine as a proton quencher, as 
reported before. 
54 Accordingly, the required volumes of the 
NHS-activated mPEG 2000 −COOH in methanol reacted with 
5% weight/volume PEI solution in DCM at different nominal 
ethylene oxide weight ratios (f ETO ) of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5. The 
reaction media were supplemented with 1% triethylamine 
and the required volumes of methanol to obtain the constant 
volume ratio of methanol/DCM of 2:1. Then, the vessels were 
incubated for 3 hours while mixing at 25°C. The products 
were concentrated using rotational speed-vacuum (RVC 2-18; 
Martin Christ GmbH, Osterode am Harz, Germany) until a 
yellowish white wax was obtained. The reconstituted products 
in deionized water were dialyzed using the Float-A-Lyzer 
6-8 kDa (Spectrum Laboratories Inc., Rancho Dominguez, 
CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. 
Then, the product solutions were lyophilized (Alpha 1-2 LD;

<p>H-NMR) spectroscopy was performed for the characteriza-
tion of the PEI ionomer. It showed multiple peaks at 2.3-3.1 
ppm attributed to the ethyleneimine proton and the peak of 
the ethylene glycol proton at 3.6 ppm in deuterium oxide 
(D 2 O) (data not shown). Relative yields of the reactions were 
about 86%-100%. 
To prepare complexes of Zn 
2+ and the PEI ionomers used 
as a template for the cross-linking reaction, the stock solu-
tions of mPEG-g-branched PEI copolymers (PEI ionomers) 
were prepared by reconstituting 30 mg of the lyophilized 
copolymers with the required volumes of deionized water cor-
responding to the final concentration of 2.3 M total polymer 
nitrogen. The ZnSO 4 was added at different molar ratios of 
metal ion to the polymer nitrogen (M </p>

<p>2+ </p>

<p>/N=0.1, 0.4, and 0.7) 
at different 100 mM MES buffer pH (5, 6.5, and 8) and NaCl 
concentrations (0, 50, 150 mM). The mixtures were vigorously 
micropipetted several times, incubated at ambient temperature 
for 30 minutes, and diluted ten times with deionized water. 
The L 9 -type Taguchi orthogonal array design was adopted to 
establish the optimum condition for the preparation of the 
small and uniform ionomer complexes (Table 1). </p>

<p>The cross-linking reaction was achieved via condensa-
tion occurring between the reactive amine groups of the 
copolymers and the carboxylic functional groups of 100 mM 
DTDP solution in DMSO using EDC and NHS, at the molar 
ratio 2:2:1 NHS/EDC/COOH. The degree of cross-linking 
was controlled by the cross-linking ratio (C), defined as the 
molar ratio of DTDP to primary amines that were studied 
in three levels (0.3, 0.6, and 1.2). The reaction mixture was 
allowed to stir overnight at room temperature. Then, the 
cross-linked ionomer complexes were dialyzed against the 
acidic deionized water (pH ,3) using the Float-A-Lyzer 
(6-8 kDa) to remove the Zn 
2+ template and to prepare the 
nano-networks. </p>

<p>-templated ionomer dispersions

of 1-2 mg/mL, using a Zetasizer 3000 HSA from Malvern 
Instruments (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) at a 
fixed scattering angle of 90°, using a helium-neon laser 
(λ=633 nm). The PDI is a dimensionless measure of the 
heterogeneity of particle sizes calculated from a cumulants 
analysis of the measured intensity autocorrelation function. 
The viscosity and refractive index of pure water at 25°C 
were used for data analysis. Zeta-potential measurements 
were performed for 1/10 dilutions of the dispersions in 
phosphate-buffered saline (pH =7.4), based on the elec-
trophoretic mobility of the particles in a clear, disposable 
capillary electrophoresis cell. Values were given as the mean 
of triplicate samples. </p>

<p>The aqueous dispersions of the PEI ionomer (f ETO =0.3, C=0) 
and the corresponding nano-networks at different cross-link 
ratios (C=0.3, C=0.6) were simply mixed by pipetting with an 
aqueous solution of MTX in the deionized water at different 
ratios of MTX to molar amine moieties of the PEI ionomer 
(R=0.15, 0.3, and 0.6) at different pH (5, 6, and 7). 
The mixtures were incubated for 72 hours at room tem-
perature while shaking at 400 rpm. The unbound MTX was 
removed by ultrafiltration using Amicon YM-30 centrifugal 
filter devices (EMD Millipore). The concentration of MTX 
in filtrates was determined using a Knauer high-performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with P1000 pump 
(Herbert Knauer GmbH, Berlin, Germany) equipped with 
a multiple wavelength ultraviolet (UV) detector (UV 2600 
detector). Separation of MTX was achieved at ambient </p>

<p>sequential optimization of methotrexate encapsulation in micellar nano-networks </p>

<p>temperature, using monolithic reversed phase column 
(Chromolith 
® Guard column, RP-18e, 5-4.6 mm; Merck). 
The mobile phase was composed of 100 mM sodium acetate 
(pH 4) acetonitrile (volume ratio of 88:12) and was delivered 
isocratically at a flow rate of 2 mL/minute. 
The HPLC method was validated in terms of specificity, 
linearity, accuracy, precision, and limit of quantification for 
an in vitro assay. Accordingly, the entrapment efficiency (the 
percentage of MTX entrapped to the total amount added) and 
the entrapment capacity (percentage of the entrapped MTX 
to the total amount of loaded system) were calculated. 
The effects of the different factors (pH, feeding ratios, 
and the cross-link ratios) on the loading parameters were 
investigated by full factorial design in three levels (Table 2). 
The factors were analyzed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Design-Expert</rs> 
® Software 
version <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">6.02</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Stat-Ease, Inc</rs>., Minneapolis, MN, USA). 
The particle sizes and ζ potentials of MTX-loaded 
nano-networks were determined at different cross-link ratios 
(0.0, 0.3, and 0.6) and a constant MTX feed ratio of 0.3, 
according to the section "Remote loading of MTX." </p>

<p>atomic force microscopy </p>

<p>To explore the morphology of the particles, samples were 
prepared for atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging by 
depositing 10 µL of 0.2 mg/mL aqueous dispersion of empty 
and MTX-loaded nano-networks (R=0.3) at different cross-link 
ratios (0.3 and 0.6) in comparison with the complexes of the 
MTX and the PEI ionomer, onto a prewashed glass slide. The 
AFM imaging was performed in air using a vibration-damped 
NanoWizard 
® II (JPK Instruments AG, Berlin, Germany). 
Commercial pyramidal tips (MicroMasch Inc., Tartu, Estonia) 
attached to I-type cantilevers with a length of about 230 µm, 
a resonance frequency of about 380 kHz, and a nominal force </p>

<p>constant of 40 N/m were used. Images were recorded in an 
intermittent contact mode at a scan speed of approximately

images had a resolution of 512×512 pixels. The topological 
characteristics, including projected diameter (d), surface area 
(A), perimeter (P), and maximum height (Z max ), were measured 
randomly by the software for at least 300 particles. 
Subsequently, the shape factors (circularity and aspect

<p>In vitro release study </p>

<p>The release of the MTX from the nano-networks prepared at 
the cross-link ratio of 0.3 was evaluated by the dialysis method 
at R=0.3 for 24 hours in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 
pH 7.4; 0.14 M NaCl) and acetate buffered saline (pH 5.5; 
0.14 M NaCl) without or with 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl) 
phosphine (TCEP) as a reducing agent. 
Briefly, 4 mL MTX-loaded nano-networks containing 
2.5 mg of the PEI ionomer and 1.4 mg of MTX were placed 
in the Float-A-Lyzer 6-8 kDa dialysis tube. The dialysis was 
carried out against 400 mL of the release media in a shaking 
incubator at 37°C and 100 rpm. 
At scheduled times, 1 mL of the medium was withdrawn, 
and the amount of MTX released was estimated by the 
HPLC method as described in the section "Remote loading 
of MTX." The cumulative release percentage of MTX was 
determined at each point and plotted as a function of time. </p>

<p>The control experiment was done to study free MTX 
transport through the dialysis membrane at the simulated 
media. To find out the mechanism of drug release from the 
nano-networks, the Korsmeyer-Peppas equation (Equation 
3) was best fitted for the first 60% drug release data in com-
parison to other mathematical equations, including zero order, 
first order, and the Higuchi models. 
55 The release rate (k), the 
release exponent (n), and the lag time (t 0 ) were determined 
from the fraction of MTX released (M/M ∞ ) versus time (t) by 
a nonlinear regression method, using <rs id="software-3" type="software">SPSS Statistics</rs> version

<p>redox-sensitive degradation </p>

<p>To study the redox biodegradability of the nano-networks, 
the thiol content of the cross-linked nanoparticles was deter-
mined prior to and after reducing the disulfide bond present in 
the DTDP molecule, according to the published method. </p>

<p>56   Briefly, 25 µL of the 0.2 M NaBH 4 solution in NaOH 
0.2% was added to 45 µL of the sample solutions, which 
contained 4 mM nitrogen, and incubated for 1 hour at room 
temperature while shaking at 300 rpm. Then, pH was adjusted 
to 4 using HCl 1 N and further incubated for 10 minutes to 
remove the NaBH 4 from the reaction medium. The medium 
was supplemented with NaOH 1 N to adjust the pH again 
to 8. The volume reached 90 µL with the addition of (4-(2-
hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) (HEPES) 
buffer (300 mM; pH 8.0). Then, 10 µL (4 mg/mL) DTNB 
in the HEPES buffer (50 mM; pH 8.0) was added, and the 
mixture was incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. 
Absorbance values were obtained with a PowerWave HT 
microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) at λ=412 
nm, and the thiol content was calculated using a standard 
curve of the reduced glutathione and expressed as mmol/L 
free thiol. </p>

<p>In vitro cellular studies </p>

<p>The MTT-based cytotoxicity assay was carried out based 
on the protocol described previously. 
57 Accordingly, the 
HepG2 cells were plated into 96-well microtiter plates 
(Orange Scientific, Braine-l′Alleud, Belgium) at a density 
of 25,000 cells/cm 
2 . After 24 hours, the cells were treated in 
serum-supplemented culture medium. First, the assay was 
performed for the nano-networks at the cross-link ratios 
of 0.3 and 0.6, in comparison to the PEI ionomer and the 
branched PEI (M w =10 kDa). In another experiment, the </p>

<p>cytotoxicity of MTX was determined in HepG2 cells incu-
bated with the free drug for 24, 48, and 72 hours. Finally, 
the cytotoxicity of the MTX-loaded nano-networks was 
compared to the free MTX after 24 hours. Each treatment 
was similarly prepared by the primary dilution of the stock 
solutions in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) and the final 
10× dilution in RPMI 1640 medium (PAA Laboratories 
GmbH, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine 
serum (Gibco BRL). 
Following incubation, the medium was aspirated and 
replaced by 100 µL of 1/10 diluted MTT stock solution 
in the culture medium to obtain the final concentration of 
0.5 mg/mL. After 3 hours, the medium was aspirated again, 
and the insoluble formazan crystals were dissolved in 
100 µL/well DMSO and measured spectrophotometrically 
in a microplate reader at λ=570 nm, and corrected for back-
ground absorption at λ=650 nm. Cell viability was calculated 
for blank-corrected data relative to untreated control cells. 
To determine cellular uptake potential of the nano-
networks, the cells were grown on Lab-Tek II 4-well cham-
ber slides with covers (Nunc, USA Scientific, Ocala, FL, 
USA) at a density of 2×10 
4 cells per chamber. The cells 
were treated with 50 µg/mL of nano-networks labeled with 
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), washed three times with 
cold PBS, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde solution in 
PBS at 4°C for 15 minutes, followed by washing with PBS. 
Cellular internalization of the nanohydrogels was studied 
by epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse E400; Nikon 
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). </p>

<p>Results and discussion 
Template-assisted synthesis 
of nano-networks </p>

<p>The preparation method requires a low-energy mixing pro-
cess, and it does not require the use of any organic solvent. 
The donor-acceptor complexes of Zn 
2+ and the amines of the 
PEI ionomers can be considered as a special type of copolymer 
with lyophobic segments formed from the phase separation 
of the ethyleneimine moieties with Zn </p>

<p>2+ </p>

<p>. The water-soluble 
mPEG segments stabilize the coacervates and prevent the 
aggregation or the macroscopic phase separation. </p>

<p>sequential optimization of methotrexate encapsulation in micellar nano-networks </p>

<p>Similarly, the formation of metal colloids has been shown 
in aqueous medium by the reduction of the lyophobic com-
plexes of diblock or graft PEO-PEI with Pd 
2+ or Pt 
2+ at low 
pH. 
25,34 The preparation requires a precise tuning of differ-
ent physicochemical parameters, such as f ETO , pH, the ionic 
strength of the solution, and the type and the concentration 
of the ionic species, inducing the gelation of ionomers. </p>

<p>23,58   Therefore, it was hypothesized that the colloid property of 
the complexes of PEI ionomers with Zn 
2+ depends on some 
factors such as pH, the molar ratio of Zn </p>

<p>2+ </p>

<p>, f ETO , and salt 
concentration. The factors were considered in the Taguchi 
orthogonal array design for optimization of the size distribu-
tion. The Taguchi method is a fractional factorial design pro-
posed by Genichi Taguchi, a Japanese engineer, to improve 
the quality of products or processes. 
Accordingly, the particle size data (Z-average and PDI) 
were analyzed statistically by changing the experimental 
factors simultaneously, according to the designed array in 
three levels (Table 1). The data were successfully fitted in 
individual two-factor interaction models (P,0.0001 and 
P,0.05, respectively). 
If the Z-average was considered as a response variable, 
pH (P,0.0001), the molar ratio of Zn 
2+ (P,0.0001), and 
their interaction (P approximately 0.001) were determined 
significant. Figure 2A shows the sizes increased abruptly if 
the molar ratio of Zn 
2+ increased from 0.2, possibly due to 
an insufficiency of mPEG chains to solubilize the lyophobic 
PEI-Zn 
2+ domains. Similarly, it was shown that the aggrega-
tion occurs for the block ionomer of polyacrylic acid at a 
relatively high concentration of Ba 
2+ and Gd </p>

<p>3+ </p>

<p>. 
59 The particles 
enlarged by increasing pH from 5-6.5, especially at the molar 
ratios of Zn 
2+ $0.4 (Figure 2B). This could be explained by 
the reduced protonation of the PEI backbone at a more basic 
pH, and the very low solubility of the Zn 
2+ complexes, due 
to the binding of the hydroxyl ion ligands. 
The main effect of the molar ratio of Zn 
2+ (P,0.05) and 
the related interaction effect with salt concentration (P,0.05) 
were statistically significant terms influencing PDI. A rela-
tively high level of the molar ratio of Zn 
2+ resulted in more 
homogeneous particles that might occur due to the cross-
link action of Zn </p>

<p>2+ </p>

<p>, though the PDI values were still high. 
An increase of the salt concentration brought about a higher 
PDI at the low level of Zn </p>

<p>2+ </p>

<p>; however, the lowest PDI was 
attained at the high level of salt concentration (150 mM) if the 
molar ratio of Zn 
2+ was 0.4. This controversial effect of salt 
concentration might be due to displacement of Zn 
2+ from their 
complexes at the high NaCl concentration during the phase-
separation step. This phenomenon was reported previously </p>

<p>for PEO-g-PEI/surfactant complexes. 
60,61 Nevertheless, the 
salt might stabilize the lyophobic complexes of Zn 
2+ at the 
molar ratio of 0.4, possibly through the formation of the salt 
bridges on the interface of the lyophobic complexes. 
The optimum condition def ined by the minimum 
Z-average × PDI comprises the molar ratio of Zn 
2+ =0.2, 
pH =5.7, f ETO =0.3, and without additional salt. The resulted 
self-assembly exhibited Z-average of 33.7 nm and PDI of 
0.22 and served as a micellar template for synthesis of cross-
linked polymer micelles in the next step. 
Cross-linking of the polyamine core of the micellar 
template was achieved via condensation reaction with the 
carboxylic functional groups of DTDP, a homobifunctional 
carboxylic acid based electrophilic cross-linking reagent with 
a length of 1.2 nm and a cleavable disulfide linkage. Following </p>

<p>. The </p>

<p>H-NMR spectra of the nano-networks showed the total inte-
gral intensity of the signals due to −S−CH 2 CH 2 −C=O protons 
of DTDP (m, δ: 2.4-2.9) increased by the cross-link ratio in 
comparison to the ethylene glycol peak of the PEI ionomers 
in the swollen state (data not shown). The estimated degree 
of cross-links per primary amines with the nominal cross-link 
ratio of 0.3 was calculated as 7.36%. This value gradually 
increased and reached 15.72% for the nominal cross-linking 
ratio of 1.2. It is noteworthy to mention that DTDP can also 
form a loop within a single chain; therefore, the calculated 
degrees of cross-linking can be overestimated. 
Figure 3A shows the sizes increased after removing 
Zn 
2+ to about 150-250 nm at the relatively lower cross-link 
ratios (0.3 and 0.6). These observations are consistent with </p>

<p>the swelling nature of the nano-networks. It was understood 
from Table 2 that the average volumes of the swollen nano-
networks changed more than ten times upon the removal 
of Zn 
2+ at C=0.3, while the volumes exhibited only a mod-
est increase at the higher ratios compared to those of the 
precursor complexes of Zn 
2+ and PEI ionomer. The aver-
age sizes of the nano-networks decreased by increasing C 
from 0.3-1.2. 
This is in line with other studies that showed that if the 
cross-link ratio increased, the smaller particles of PEO-b-
PAA were prepared. 
15,16 Nevertheless, the average sizes of 
the cross-linked complexes of the Zn 
2+ and the PEI ionomer 
increased markedly at the cross-link ratio of 1.2 before 
removing Zn 
2+ from the micellar templates. This could 
be explained by an increase of the hydrophobicity of PEI 
ionomer/Zn 
2+ complexes, due to the amide bond formation 
mediated by DTDP and the failure of the mPEG chains to 
prevent aggregation. 
Figure 3B shows that an increase of PDI happened upon 
the removal of Zn 
2+ that was less pronounced at C=0.6. The 
changes of PDI could be explained by the positive physical 
cross-link action of Zn 
2+ , which disappeared after acid 
dialysis. Taking into consideration these results, the synthe-
sis method produces a hydrophilic network with a relatively 
more uniform population of small particles if compared to 
other methods, such as polyionic complexation, desolvation, 
emulsion droplet coalescence, and direct cross-linking. </p>

<p>62   remote loading of MTX </p>

<p>MTX, a weak bicarboxylic acid with pKa values of 3.8 and 
4.8, could be immobilized into the PEI nano-networks (appar-
ent pKa approximately 8.5) by the simple mixing of the MTX 
solution with the aqueous dispersions of the nano-networks. 
Although it seems that the MTX loading was mainly governed 
through electrostatic charge complexation, we cannot exclude 
the possibility that the drug molecules can be physically 
entrapped and retained in the networks, due to nonspecific 
hydrophobic interactions. 
Table 3 shows full-factorial design optimization of the 
MTX loading into the nano-networks. The drug loading 
was expressed as a function of pH, C and the R in terms 
of the loading efficiency (LE%) and the loading capacity 
(LC%). The results of analysis of variance revealed that 
MTX loading follows the two-factor interaction statisti-
cal model (P,0.0001 similarly for LE% and LC%). The 
main effects of C and R and their interaction (C × R) were 
determined as the significant terms included in the cor-
responding models. </p>

<p>sequential optimization of methotrexate encapsulation in micellar nano-networks </p>

<p>Figure 4A shows that an increase of R led to a significant 
decline of LE% of the PEI ionomer (P=0.001), while LE% 
was little changed by R for the nano-networks; however, 
Figure 4B shows that LC% was almost constant for the PEI 
ionomer (P0.05), but increased for the nano-networks 
(P=0.001). The increase was more pronounced for R in the 
range of 0.15 and 0.30, but less at R=0.6, possibly due to 
reduced binding sites for MTX loading. 
Remarkably, the LC% in the PEI ionomer was lower than 
the nano-networks at R=0.6. It could be explained by the 
formation of the hydrophobic MTX-bound domains in the 
polyionic segment of the PEI ionomer stabilized by the mPEG 
chains that could lead to a self-assembly, preventing the 
further loading of MTX molecules. Unlike the PEI ionomer, 
hollow spaces of the nano-networks provide the free diffusion 
of MTX molecules, so the interaction of MTX with the outer 
layer amines does not restrict the subsequent loading. 
Higher degrees of cross-linking may lead to a decreased 
LC% (Figure 4B and C) as reported before for the 
cross-linked PEO-b-PMA micelles. 
16 The pH changes provide </p>

<p>an opportunity to tune the electrostatic binding between the 
MTX and the ionomer chains. LC% did not change by pH 
in the range of 5-7, since the MTX molecule has a similar 
negative-charge density in that pH range, and the polymer 
chain is protonated in the same way at pH =5-7. Both the 
optimum LE% and LC% were achieved at the average pH 
of 6 and R=0.3 for the nano-networks, especially at C=0.3. </p>

<p>The optimum LC% of 57% was noticeably higher than the 
previous report of 12%, 
63 so the nano-networks satisfactorily 
loaded MTX. 
Table 2 shows that MTX loading was accompanied by 
reduction of the Z-average of the nano-networks especially 
at the low cross-link ratio (C=0.3) (P&lt;0.05), suggesting that 
the drug loading attenuated swelling of the nano-networks 
through formation of charge-neutralized hydrophobic 
domains; moreover, the drug loading did not cause any 
adverse effect on the particle stability. 
Notably, the MTX-loaded nano-networks exhibited 
almost zero value of zeta potential, suggesting that MTX 
was effectively neutralized by the core amines; nevertheless, 
nano-networks showed only few positive charges that reduced 
by increasing the cross-link ratio. The reduced zeta potentials 
are possibly due to an arrangement of the mPEG chains 
around the cross-linked polyamine core that shifts the shear 
plane away from the positive core, as indicated before. </p>

<p>An AFM experiment was performed to investigate topo-
logical properties of the empty and the MTX-loaded 
nano-networks (R=0.3) at C=0.3 (cross-link 1) and 0.6 
(cross-link 2) compared to the complex of the PEI iono-
mer and the MTX. As shown in Figure 5, discrete, small, 
and round particles were observed for the nano-networks 
at C=0.6 that were smaller and more uniform than the 
complexes of the ionomer and the MTX. Table 4 shows 
that the average projected diameters of dehydrated empty 
nano-networks decreased to about 50 nm, if compared to the 
hydrodynamic diameters as determined by Zetasizer. After 
loading the MTX into the nano-networks, the diameters and 
the Z-values increased significantly (P,0.05), as compared 
to the empty particles. The average circularity of the empty 
nanonetwork (C=0.3; R=0) increased significantly (P,0.05) </p>

<p>from 0.59-0.78 (C=0.6; R=0) and 0.81 (C=0.3; R=0.3) in a 
similar pattern that could be explained by the formation of 
more homogeneous and spherical particles. Upon adsorption 
of the nano-networks on a glass surface, they exhibited a high 
aspect ratio, suggesting that the particles were flattened on 
the substrate as previously addressed. </p>

<p>59   In vitro release study </p>

<p>Figure 6 shows the release profiles of the MTX loaded 
nano-networks (C=0.6; R=0.3) in isotonic-balanced release 
media (pH 5.5 or 7.5 + 140 mM NaCl). A prolonged release 
of MTX achieved over 24 hours is consistent with the previ-
ous reports of a sustained MTX release for 8-24 hours. </p>

<p>65,66   No burst release or very significant lag-time was recognized </p>

<p>(P0.05) for the MTX-loaded nano-networks if compared 
to free MTX, although the initial burst behavior has been 
reported in several studies, due to the fast escape of the free 
MTX out of the nanoparticles. 
67,68 The better control of the 
initial burst release might be explained by the formation 
of a core-enriched model of an active MTX loading within 
the closely packed amine moieties. The release data were 
analyzed, according to the mathematical power function 
(Korsmeyer-Peppas model) to understand the mechanisms 
by which the drug release happened and to calculate the 
corresponding constants (Table 5). The MTX release was 
determined swelling-controlled, that means the reduced drug 
concentration gradient over the time period was compensated 
by an increased swelling of the nano-network which happens </p>

<p>following MTX release. It was found that the nano-networks 
show a control over the MTX release, since n was calculated 
to be near the value of one, especially at the physiologic pH 
of 7.5. It could be explained by the reservoir action of the 
nanonetwork for the negatively charged molecules, such as 
MTX. The effect of pH and the cross-linking reaction on the 
rate constant (K) and n were not found significant (P0.05). 
MTX is a weak acidic drug that exhibits more solubility at 
pH 7.5 than at 5.5. The lower solubility of MTX at the acidic 
environment of inflamed tissues can be considered as a hurdle 
for the delivery of MTX. The negative solubility behavior of 
MTX was improved most likely by a pronounced swelling of 
the nano-networks that compensates the reduced solubility 
of the drug in the relatively acidic pH of 5.5. 
To evaluate whether reducing the disulfide containing cross-
link (DTDP) can trigger MTX release from the nano-networks, 
the study was repeated in the release media supplemented with 
a reducing agent, such as TCEP, which is active in a broad range 
of pH and simulates the reducing action of glutathione. The 
TCEP treatment increased K, irrespective of the medium pH </p>

<p>(P,0.05), that -in turn -indicates that the MTX release can 
be accelerated in the intracellular reducing environment. </p>

<p>redox-sensitive degradation </p>

<p>To fabricate a stabilized redox-sensitive system for intra-
venous administration, bioreversible disulfide containing 
cross-links (DTDP) were used for the preparation of the 
nano-networks. 
To study whether the disulfide bonds in the core of 
the nano-networks undergo cleavage, the empty particles 
were incubated in a simulated medium containing reduc-
ing agents, such as NaBH 4 . Figure 7 shows the ratio of 
free thiol to total primary amines of the nano-networks 
increased in the presence of the reducing agent, as the 
cross-link density increased. The cross-links were stable 
during synthesis of the nano-networks since no significant 
free thiol was found at the end of the reaction; nevertheless, 
the stable disulfide containing cross-links could be prone 
to glutathione mediated reduction, which predominantly 
occurs in the intracellular medium. </p>

<p>cytotoxic effect. In contrast, the nano-networks showed 
practically no cytotoxic effect at concentrations below 
100 µg/mL. This interesting result could be explained by 
the substantially reduced ζ-potentials of the nano-networks 
and the shielding effect of the mPEG shell, as discussed by 
different authors. </p>

<p>71,72   Prior to evaluating the activity of the MTX-loaded nano-
networks, the cytotoxicity of free MTX was studied as a 
function of the drug concentration after 24, 48, and 72 hours 
(Figure 8B). The incubation of HepG2 cells with increasing 
concentrations of MTX in the range of 0.1-100 µM did not 
result in significant changes in cell viability at each time 
interval; however, a time-dependent cytotoxic effect was 
observed (P,0.001), as previously reported, 
73 since MTX is 
a cytostatic chemotherapeutic agent that mainly inhibits cell 
proliferation. The toxicity on HepG2 cells was augmented 
for the MTX loaded in the nano-networks (P,0.05), espe-
cially at the concentrations above 1 µM (Figure 8C), though 
the empty nano-networks did not demonstrate cytotoxicity. 
The finding might be related to the mechanisms by which 
free MTX transports into cells. The cellular entry of MTX 
is restricted to saturable mechanisms, such as the reduced 
folate transmembrane carrier and the folate receptor. 
74 Unlike 
free MTX, the MTX-loaded nano-networks can enter the 
cells via a parallel endocytic pathway. Moreover, the drug 
molecules that escaped from the endosomal compartment are 
less accessible to efflux pumps; therefore, a higher cellular 
accumulation of MTX and an enhanced cytotoxicity can be 
achieved. The issue was similarly addressed for different 
nanoparticulate systems. </p>

<p>75,76 </p>

<p>Conclusion </p>

<p>The nano-networks synthesized successfully through the 
cross-linking of the micellar template of the PEI ionomer 
complex, whose size distribution is controlled by pH and the 
molar ratio of a complexing metal ion, such as Zn </p>

<p>2+   . They 
comprise a polycation swollen core structure stabilized by a 
hydrophilic mPEG shell, avoiding unfavorable interactions 
with biological interfaces. The nano-networks exhibited some 
appropriate pharmaceutical properties, such as small sizes, 
uniformity, globular morphology, and flexibility without using 
high shear forces or organic solvents for manipulation. They 
were able to accommodate negatively charged molecules, 
such as MTX, efficiently featured with a higher encapsula-
tion capacity than the corresponding polyionic micelles and 
a prolonged MTX release in a swelling-controlled manner; 
moreover, the strategy of reductive activation of nanonetwork 
biodegradation boosted the release rate in the simulated </p>

<p>intracellular medium. Taken together, these observations 
and the enhanced antitumor activity in vitro might imply the 
potential application of the nano-networks for the successful 
delivery of MTX that should be tested in vivo. </p>

<p>echargeable lithium ion batteries (LIBs) operating on shuttling of lithium between the negative and positive 
electrodes, both of which are composed of topotactic insertion hosts of lithium such as graphite and 
LiCoO 2 , are indispensable to our society as power sources for portable and large electronic appliances 
such as notebook computers and electric vehicles. However, their energy densities are rather modest; even the 
state-of-the-art LIBs do not exceed 250 Wh kg </p>

<p>21 </p>

<p>. Therefore, various researches are being carried out to develop 
post-LIBs with much higher energy densities. 
One of the approaches is utilization of electrode materials operating on so-called conversion reactions and the 
theoretical specific capacity is 714 mAh g 
21 for the reaction of CoO 1 2Li 
1 1 2e 
2 R Co 1 Li 2 O 
1 , while the severe 
hysteresis in voltage between the charging and discharging processes generally limits the energy efficiency. 
Moreover, some metal oxides including CoO show surprisingly good cycling reversibility despite the highly 
destructive nature of the conversion reaction. However, such oxide materials can be used only for anodes, because 
their working potentials are typically in the range of 0-1 V (vs. Li/Li 
1 ) and low. Recently, some fluorides such as 
BiF 3 
2 and FeF 2 (or FeF 3 ) 
3 have been reported to operate at higher potentials (2.7-3.4 V), while their poor kinetics 
and reversibility are problems. 
Another approach is a development of a lithium-air (Li-O 2 ) battery by use of atmospheric O 2 with a theoretical 
specific energy of 3400 Wh kg 
21 even including the weight of oxygen in the discharged product (Li 2 O 2 ). However, 
the actual capacity or the energy is dependent on the pore volumes of the cathode matrices where Li 2 O 2 is formed, 
the pores are clogged with solids, and the discharge is prohibited by the limitation of the oxygen supply. In 
addition, there are more serious inherent problems of the open device, suffering from the coexisting moisture and 
CO 2 , and safety for the application to electronic vehicles. The main discharge product for Li-O 2 batteries is Li 2 O 2 
according to the reaction (the equilibrium potential, Eu (vsLi 2 O 2 z2Li

<p>However, there is no report on the repetition of the charge and

22 ) and Li 2 O 2 
(or O 2

Li-rich layered oxides shows not only the charge compensation 
mechanism involving transition metal ions but also some contri-
bution of the reversible redox reaction of oxygen atoms </p>

<p>10-13 </p>

<p>. 
Therefore, we have reached an idea that Li 2 O 2 would act as a 3 V-
level cathode utilizing the redox couple of oxide (O 
22 )/peroxide 
(O 2 
22 ) [equation (2)]. In addition, a certain electrode catalyst or 
mediator would selectively accelerate the thermodynamically more 
favourable backward reaction of equation (2) instead of the back-
ward reaction of equation (1) and the following reaction, </p>

<p>Results 
Preparation and Characterization of the Co-Doped Li 2 O Cathode. 
The powders (Co/Li 5 0.025-0.2) of Li 2 O and Co 3 O 4 were 
pulverized and the Co-doped Li 2 O were obtained. Among them, 
the Co-doped Li 2 O (Co/Li 5 0.1) showed the best charge-
discharge performance (Supplementary Figure S1a). The electronic 
conductivity of the Co-doped Li 2 O (Co/Li 5 0.1) powder compact 
was 5.3 3 10 
2 kV cm, while Li 2 O is an insulator. Therefore, the 
resulting Co-doped Li 2 O (Co/Li 5 0.1) was hereafter used as a 
cathode and the specific capacity was calculated on the basis of the 
total weight of the Co-doped Li 2 O. Rh 2 O 3 and IrO 2 could also act 
similarly to Co 3 O 4 (Supplementary Figure S1b). 
In the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the Co-doped Li 2 O 
(Supplementary Figure S2), broad peaks of anti-fluorite-type Li 2 O 
and a weak peak at 44.8u of cubic LiCoO 2 
15 were observed, while 
peaks of spinel-type Co 3 O 4 were not observed. The peak intensity of 
the cubic LiCoO 2 increased upon increase in the Co/Li ratio. 
The Co K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) 
measurement of the Co-doped Li 2 O was carried out to investigate the 
oxidation states and coordination environments of the Co species 
(Supplementary Figure S3). The absorption edge position agreed 
with that of starting Co 3 O 4 , indicating that the average Co valence 
does not change under mechanical milling conditions. The pre-edge 
peak of the Co-doped Li 2 O was stronger than those of Co 3 O 4 and 
LiCoO 2 and as strong as that of the spinel CoAl 2 O 4 , in which every 
Co 
21 ion is located at the tetrahedral site. This absorption represents 
the transition of the 1s electron to an unoccupied d orbital of Co ions, 
which is an electric dipole forbidden transition in an ideal octahedral 
symmetry, while the noncentrosymmetric tetrahedral environment 
allows the transition </p>

<p>. Thus, the intense pre-edge peak shows the 
presence of considerable amounts of tetrahedral Co. </p>

also quantified the O 2

<p>Observation and Analysis of the Cathode during the Charge. The

curve (Figure 4a). In the range of 0-216 mAh g

increased. The slope of O 2 evolution in the range of 324-594 mAh

Supplementary Figure S4). The evolution of CO 2 was not observed in 
the whole range of the charge process. 
Direct observation of the Co-doped Li 2 O cathode charged to 
270 mAh g 
21 was attempted with high resolution transmission elec-
tron microscopy (HRTEM). Figure 5 shows the HRTEM image and 
the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern. Since some spots in 
Figure 5b lie on the circles estimated with the Li 2 O 2 crystal structure, 
many fringe regions surrounded by red circles in Figure 5a are likely 
attributable to Li 2 O 2 . In contrast, for the starting cathode before the 
charge, since all spots (Supplementary Figure S5b) lie on the circles 
estimated with Li 2 O or cubic LiCoO 2 crystal structures, many fringe 
regions surrounded by red circles (Supplementary Figure S5a) are 
likely attributable to Li 2 O or cubic LiCoO 2 . </p>

<p>Discussion 
Upon increase in Co content above Co/Li 5 0.1, the discharge capa-
city decreased (Supplementary Figure S1a) and the XRD peak intens-
ity of cubic LiCoO 2 increased (Supplementary Figure S2), suggesting </p>

<p>that the resulting cubic LiCoO 2 is inactive for the charge and 
discharge reactions at the voltage of 2.0-3.2 V (vs. Li/Li </p>

<p>1 </p>

<p>) as has 
been reported in ref. (18). 
In the XRD pattern of the Co-doped Li 2 O (Supplementary Figure 
S2), broad peaks of anti-fluorite-type Li 2 O and a weak peak at 44.8u 
of cubic LiCoO 2 
15 were observed, while peaks of spinel-type Co 3 O 4 
were not observed. The volume fractions of Co-doped Li 2 O and cubic 
LiCoO 2 were estimated to be 0.9050.10 with the parameters of 111 
reflection of Co-doped Li 2 O and 200 one of cubic LiCoO 2 in 
Supplementary Table S1 (see the Supplementary Information). The 
Co K-edge XANES spectrum of the Co-doped Li 2 O shows the pres-
ence of considerable amounts of tetrahedral Co (Supplementary 
Figure S3). These results indicate that most of Co ions are substitu-
tionally doped in the tetrahedral Li sites of the anti-fluorite Li 2 O 
structure with formation of vacancies at the same sites due to charge 
compensation. Co 
21 and Co 
31 in the Co-doped Li 2 O would be ran-
domly distributed at the tetrahedral sites in a defective anti-fluorite 
structure, since the XRD pattern was not identical to that of the 
defective anti-fluorite structure, in which Co ions were ordered in 
the tetrahedral sites </p>

The Co-doped Li 2 O cathode, of which the theoretical specific 
capacity is calculated to be 556 mAh g 
21 based on the weight of 
Li 2 O in the Co-doped Li 2 O (see the Supplementary Information), 
exhibited a reversible capacity over 190 mAh g </p>

<p>21 </p>

<p>, a high rate cap-
ability, and a good cyclability (Figure 1). The electronic conductivity 
of the Co-doped Li 2 O powder compact was 5.3 3 10 
2 kV cm and of 
the same level (5 3 10 
2 kV cm) as that of LiMn 2 O 4 
21 , showing that 
the Co-doped Li 2 O can work as an electrode material. This conduc-
tivity is possibly explained by narrowing of the Li 2 O band gap by 
formation of the impurity state with the dope of Co or becoming 
metallic by the carrier dope. The coulombic efficiency of the present 
system is 96% and still below 100%. This is possibly explained by the 
progress of the side reaction of solid electrolyte interface formation 
during the charge other than CO 2 formation. 
To clarify the oxidation states of Co and the presence of O 2 
22 in the 
Co-doped Li 2 O cathode, the Co K-edge XANES measurement and </p>

22 was 
2.31 mmol g 
21 in approximate agreement with that for the first 
charge, suggesting reversible formation of O 2 
22 in the repeated 
cycles. 
It is essentially important for the present battery that no substan-
tial amount of O 2 is released in the charge process. Moreover, CO 2 
evolution accompanied by anodic side reactions between Li 2 O 2 and 
carbon additives or electrolytes has been pointed out as a problem of 
the Li-O 2 batteries </p>

<p>22-24 </p>

<p>. In the range of 0-216 mAh g

hardly observed (Figure 4b), suggesting that the side reactions of

ing to the reaction, 2O

<p>2 </p>

<p>, with some contribution of 
the oxidation of Co ions. The slope of 0.25 O 2 /e 
2 in the range of 324-

21 suggests that O 2 is formed according to the direct 
reaction (i) 2Li 2 O R O 2 1 4Li

tion (ii) 2Li 2 O R Li 2 O 2 1 2Li

<p>). The investigation on the mech-
anism of the O 2 evolution is in progress. The XRD 111 peak intensity 
of the Co-doped Li 2 O was approximately linearly weakened with 
increase in the charge capacity toward the theoretical capacity of 
556 mAh g 
21 (Figure 4c and Supplementary Figure S4). The upper 
deviation from the linear line at 540 and 580 mAh g 
21 is probably 
due to the O 2 evolution. While the HRTEM image shows fringe 
regions attributed to Li 2 O 2 (Figure 5), the XRD patterns of Co-doped 
Li 2 O upon charged to 270, 324 and 540 mAh g 
21 showed no Li 2 O 2 
signal (Supplementary Figure S4) because of the small amount and 
poor crystallinity. The evolution of CO 2 was not observed in the 
whole range of the charge process, showing that the Co-doped 
Li 2 O cathode is free from side reactions to produce CO 2 and the 
superconcentrated LiFSA electrolyte in acetonitrile is stable under 
the present conditions. 
All results demonstrate that the Co-doped Li 2 O cathode is 
charged without the O 2 evolution in the region of 0-216 mAh g </p>

MBRAUN) at atomic ratio of Co/Li 5 0.1. The milling pot was fixed in a planetary 
ball mill machine (Pulverisette 7, Fritsch) and agitated with zirconia milling balls 
(10 mm diameter 3 25) at 600 rpm for 200 h. Then, the milling pot was opened in an 
Ar-filled glove box and a dark green powder was collected. The elemental analysis of 
the resulting powder was carried out by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission 
spectroscopy (ICP-AES); Li 28.7 wt%, Co 24.0 wt%, atomic ratio of Co/Li 5 0.099. </p>

<p>Electrochemical Measurements. The Co-doped Li 2 O cathode was prepared by 
blending the active material thoroughly with powder acetylene black and 
polytetrafluoroethylene at the weight ratio of 4555055. The material was then pressed 
on an Al mesh (100 mesh) current collector to form an electrode. The cathode, a Li 
anode pressed on a Cu foil current collector, a concentrated electrolyte solution of 
4 M LiFSA in acetonitrile </p>

<p>14 </p>

<p>, and a glass fibre filter (GA-55, Toyo Roshi Kaisha, Ltd.) as 
a separator were assembled in two-electrode cells (HS Test Cell or CR2032 coin-type 
cell, Hosen Corp.). All these procedures were carried out in an Ar-filled glove box. 
The charge and discharge tests were conducted with a battery charge/discharge 
system HJ1001SD8 (Hokuto Denko Corporation). </p>

<p>Characterization of Materials. The elemental analysis of Li and Co was performed by 
ICP-AES with ICPS-8100 (Shimadzu). The Co-doped Li 2 O powder (11.37 mg) was 
weighed in an Ar-filled glove box and dissolved into 1 mL of an aqueous solution 
(6 M HCl). The solution was diluted in a volumetric flask to 100 mL and then 5 mL of 
the solution was diluted in a volumetric flask to 50 mL. The concentrations of Li and 
Co were quantified with standard solutions of Li and Co (0-4 ppm). 
Powder XRD patterns were measured using the monochromatized Cu-K a1 radi-
ation on a RIGAKU Smart-Lab system. Every sample was mounted in a gas-tight 
holder with a Be window filled with Ar. The charged or discharged Co-doped Li 2 O 
cathode was removed from the cell, washed three times with acetonitrile, and dried 
under vacuum. All procedures were carried out in an Ar-filled glove box. 
The oxidation states and coordination environments of Co in the cathode were 
observed with XANES measurements. The XANES measurements at the Co K-edge 
were carried out on the BL14B2 beamline at the SPring-8 synchrotron radiation 
facility (8 GeV, 100 mA) of the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute 
(JASRI) in Hyogo, Japan. A Si(111) two-crystal monochromator was used for the 
measurements of Co K-edge XANES spectra. Ion chambers filled with N 2 (100%) and 
N 2 (85%)/Ar (15%) were used for the I 0 /I detector. XANES spectra at Co K-edge were 
collected in a transmission mode, and the total acquisition time was 6 min per 
spectrum. Data reduction was performed by using the <rs type="software">REX2000</rs> program (Rigaku 
Co., Ltd.). 
The HRTEM measurements of the Co-doped Li 2 O cathode pristine and after 
charged to 270 mAh g 
21 were carried out on a JEM-4010 microscope (JEOL, Japan) at 
an accelerating voltage of 400 kV. </p>

<p>Measurements of O 2 and CO 2 Evolution in the Charging Process. The Co-doped 
Li 2 O cathode (11.3 mg) was pressed on an Al mesh as a current collector. The 
negative electrode was a metallic Li foil pressed on a Cu mesh. These electrodes, a glass 
fibre filter separator, and a 4 M LiFSA electrolyte were assembled in a two electrode 
beaker cell. The resulting beaker cell, a circulation cylinder, and a 2-position 6-port 
valve with a sampling loop were assembled. All these procedures were carried out in 
an Ar-filled glove box. Then, the system was transferred outside and connected to the 
gas flow system directly connected to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (OmniStar 
GSD301, Pfeiffer Vacuum) (Supplementary Figure S6). The galvanostatic charging 
test was conducted at a rate of 4.5 mA g 
21 (50.9 mA) for 168 h at room temperature 
(ca. 298 K) with SI 1287 (Solartron) potentio/galvanostat. The gases in the cell were 
transferred to the sampling loop by using the circulating cylinder and the analysis was 
conducted every 12 h with the mass spectrometer as follows: The gases in the 
sampling loop were purged with a carrier gas (He, 50 mL min </p>

<p>21 </p>

<p>) by switching the 
valve and transferred into the mass spectrometer. To remove a vapour of acetonitrile, 
the purged gases were passed through a cold trap (ca. 193 K). The concentrations of 
O 2 (m/z 5 32) and CO 2 (m/z 5 44) were determined with the integrated peak areas of 
O 2 and CO 2 (with respect to that of Ar (m/z 5 40)), respectively. </p>

under vacuum. Then, the sample, 1 g of ice water in a small glass container frozen 
with liquid nitrogen at 77 K, and a small amount of Pt powder (,1 mg) were put into 
the beaker cell (Supplementary Figure S6) and the beaker cell was closed with a gas 
tight glass cap. The resulting beaker cell, a circulation cylinder, and a 2-position 6-
port valve with a sampling loop were assembled. All these procedures were carried out 
in an Ar-filled glove box. Then, the system was quickly transferred outside and 
connected to the gas flow system directly connected to a quadrupole mass 
spectrometer (OmniStar GSD301, Pfeiffer Vacuum) (Supplementary Figure S6). 
Before the ice melted, the background oxygen concentration in the cell was analysed 
with the quadrupole mass spectrometer. Then, the sample was dispersed in the ice 
melting water and O 2 was evolved in the presence of a Pt catalyst. The amount of O 2 
evolved was quantitatively estimated with the quadrupole mass spectrometer in the 
same way as that described in the section of measurements of O 2 and CO 2 evolution in 
the charging process. It was confirmed in a separate experiment that the amount of 
Li 2 O 2 is quantitatively estimated with the amount of O 2 evolved in the presence of the 
Pt catalyst according to the reaction, Li 2 O 2 R 0.5O 2 1 Li 2 O. To confirm the origin of 
oxygen atoms in the peroxide in the Co-doped Li 2 O cathode, the labelled experiment 
was carried out by using H 2 
18 O in an N 2 -filled glove box to prevent overlapping of the 
m/z value of 
36 Ar with that of 
18 O 2 . For the mass analysis of the Co-doped Li 2 O 
cathode charged to 270 mAh g </p>

<p>21 </p>

<p>, a signal at m/z 5 32 was observed and those at m/z 
5 34 and 36 were not observed (Supplementary Figure S7). These results show that 
the oxygen atoms in the O 2 result from those in the Co-doped Li 2 O cathode. </p>

tered, and the adapters were removed using libngs (https://github.com/ 
sylvainforet/libngs) using a minimum quality of 25 bp and a minimum read 
size of 150 bp. The genomic assemblies were carried out with <rs type="software">SPAdes</rs> 
( Bankevich et al., 2012 ) using the following options: "-k 21,33,55,77,99,127-
careful -t 16 -m 64". 
To design phylogenetic markers that are broadly applicable, we focused 
primer design on common regions of high sequence homology. Initially, we 
compared the four Sebacina isolates from Eriochilus against the C. huegelii 
isolate within <rs type="software">CLC Genomics Workbench</rs> software. This allowed us to target 
the high homology sequence regions shared across the fi ve isolates for posi-
tioning the primers. Out of the 58,295 successful reads of Sebacina from 
C. huegelii , there were 1251 shared reads with E. pulchellus (average length 
285 bp) and 950 to 1605 shared reads with E. dilatatus isolates (average length </p>

<p>1 Manuscript • Premise of the study: To investigate fungal species identity and diversity in mycorrhizal fungi of order Sebacinales, we devel-
oped phylogenetic markers. These new markers will enable future studies investigating species delineation and phylogenetic 
relationships of the fungal symbionts and facilitate investigations into evolutionary interactions among Sebacina species and 
their orchid hosts. 
• Methods and Results: We generated partial genome sequences for a Sebacina symbiont originating from Caladenia hue-
gelii with 454 genome sequencing and from three symbionts from Eriochilus dilatatus and one from E. pulchellus using 
Illumina sequencing. Six nuclear and two mitochondrial loci showed high variability (10-31% parsimony informative 
sites) for Sebacinales mycorrhizal fungi across four genera of Australian orchids ( Caladenia , Eriochilus , Elythranthera , 
and Glossodia ). 
• Conclusions: We obtained highly informative DNA markers that will allow investigation of mycorrhizal diversity of Sebaci-
naceae fungi associated with terrestrial orchids in Australia and worldwide. </p>

<p>profi le was used consisting of a 3-min denaturation at 94 ° C; followed by 12 
touchdown cycles at 94 ° C (30 s) with the fi rst annealing temperature at 66 ° C 
(40 s) (−3 ° C/second cycle) and a primer extension at 72 ° C (1 min); then 
30 cycles at 94 ° C (30 s), 48 ° C (40 s), 72 ° C (1 min); with a fi nal extension at 
72 ° C for 20 min. Products were sequenced bidirectionally with ABI PRISM 
BigDye Terminator version 3.1 sequencing kit on an ABI 3100 automated 
sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, California, USA). Sequences were 
edited using the program <rs id="software-4" type="software">Sequencher</rs> <rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">version 4.7</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-4" type="creator">Gene Codes Corporation</rs>, 
Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) and aligned in <rs id="software-5" type="software">Geneious Pro</rs> <rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-number">version 6.1.6</rs> 
( Drummond et al., 2011 ). Consistent and high-quality amplifi cation of all 
tested Sebacina isolates occurred for eight primer sets ( Table 2 ). Estimates of 
variability across the alignment of up to 31 sequences were performed within 
<rs id="software-6" type="software">MEGA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-6" type="version-number">version 5.2</rs> ( Tamura et al., 2011 ). The eight markers revealed 15-40% 
nucleotide diversity and 11-31% parsimony informative sites across these 
sequences ( Table 2 ). </p>

<p>Phylogenetic analyses -A multiple sequence alignment was constructed 
using the alignment tool in <rs id="software-7" type="software">Geneious Pro</rs> <rs corresp="#software-7" type="version-number">version 6.1.6</rs> ( Drummond et al., 
2011 ) before performing manual checks and minor adjustments. Phyloge-
nies of individual and concatenated loci were estimated with a maximum 
likelihood (ML) analysis using <rs id="software-8" type="software">RAxML</rs> <rs corresp="#software-8" type="version-number">7.0.3</rs> ( Stamatakis et al., 2008 ). 
Support for nodes was assessed for ML trees using 1000 pseudoreplicates of 
nonparametric bootstrapping in RAxML. A GTR+G substitution model was 
used for all analyses as all other models are nested inside this model. Trees were 
visualized using <rs id="software-9" type="software">FigTree</rs> <rs corresp="#software-9" type="version-number">version 1.3.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-9" type="url">http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/fi gtree</rs>/) and midpoint rooted. Among the 31 isolates, eight to 12 well-supported 
clades were identifi ed with the newly developed loci ( Fig. 1 , Appendices 
S1-S7). </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS </p>

<p>We successfully designed polymorphic markers for eight 
putative gene coding loci that successfully amplifi ed across 
the mycorrhizal fungi species complex S. vermifera. These 
new markers will allow investigations of the species diver-
sity, phylogenetic relationships, and the specifi city of orchid 
mycorrhizal associations for a wide range of Australian ter-
restrial orchids. </p>

<p>375 and 588 bp). GenBank BLAST searches (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) 
were conducted on 159 of C. huegelii sequences with high homology with at 
least two Eriochilus isolates. A total of 31 sequences (out of the 159) were 
identified as being associated with annotated or predicted genes from 
Basidiomycota R. T. Moore or Ascomycota (Berk.) Caval.-Sm. fungi. Prim-
ing sites were selected for 19 consensus sequences using <rs type="software">Primer3</rs> ( Rozen and 
Skaletsky, 2000 ); selection was based on product length, ease of primer de-
sign, and gene designation. </p>

<p>Genetic marker amplifi cation success and sequence diversity -Success-
ful fungal isolation, following Roche et al. (2010) , was obtained for several 
Sebacina isolates from host species within the Australian orchid genera Ca-
ladenia (14 spp.), Glossodia (2 spp.), Eriochilus (3 spp.), and Elythranthera 
(1 sp.). A total of 31 isolates were evaluated for DNA sequence diversity with 
the new fungal primers described below ( Tables 1 and 2 , Appendix 1). This 
set represented one to four isolates each from the 13 most strongly supported 
phylogenetic clades as revealed by a preliminary screen with ITS (bootstrap 
support &gt;0.78; data not shown) of Sebacina isolates associated with several 
Australian orchids. 
PCR reactions were performed in 30-μ L reactions containing 2 μ L of

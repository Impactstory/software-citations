<p>Objetivo: El objetivo de este estudio piloto fue 
evaluar el valor del servicio de dispensación de los 
farmacéuticos desde la perspectiva del público 
general utilizando la técnica de evaluación del 
contingente en el estado de Penang, Malasia. 
Métodos: Se muestreó convenientemente a los 
participantes en los centros comerciales y se les dio 
un cuestionario de auto-cumplimentación que 
recogía información demográfica del paciente y sus 
conocimientos del servicio de dispensación de los 
farmacéuticos. Se les presentaba una descripción 
del servicio de dispensación farmacéutica, el riesgo 
de os errores de medicación y sus consecuencias, y 
la reducción del riesgo de errores de medicación 
asociada con la intervención del farmacéutico. La 
voluntad de pagar (VDP) de los participantes se 
evaluaba después utilizando una entrevista de 
evaluación del contingente que preguntaba la 
probabilidad y la cantidad máxima que estaban 
dispuestos a pagar. 
Resultados: ¡00 personas participaron en el estudio 
y el 57% estaban entre 18 y 35 años. De estos 
participantes, el 51% eran mujeres y el 46% de 
ellos ganaba más de 1000MYR (285,71USD) al 
mes. Además, el 8% de los participantes nuncáhabía visitado una farmacia comunitaria. 
Finalmente, el 67% de los participantes estaba 
dispuesto a pagar por el servicio de dispensación 
farmacéutica; y la mediana que los participantes 
estaban dispuestos a pagar era de 10MYR 
(2,86USD). La VDP estaba ligeramente 
correlacionada con su conocimiento de los servicios 
de dispensación farmacéutica (r=0,377, p=0,02). 
Conclusión: En general, el público valorizó el 
servicio de dispensación farmacéutica. Su 
aceptación puede mejorarse educando al público 
sobre el papel del farmacéutico. </p>

<p>of their core businesses. 
1 Over the years, the 
dispensing role has been not only limited to the 
provision of the prescribed medicine to the 
consumer, but also to ensure that any medicine-
related problem in the prescription is rectified 
beforehand with proper documentation of the 
process. 
2 For centuries, this dispensing role has 
been well distinguished from the prescribing role in 
developed countries, where dispensing is the 
exclusive right of the pharmacists, while physicians 
retain their prescribing role. Although the original 
separation intention was not based purely on public 
health perspective, the fact that this separation can 
promote a rational utilisation of medicine, reduce 
medication errors, and minimise ethical conflicts of 
physicians as prescribers and suppliers have 
prompted several other countries to separate these 
roles accordingly. </p>

<p>3 </p>

<p>However, in some countries such as Malaysia, the 
physician is still allowed to assume the role of 
dispensing due to the historical shortage of 
pharmacists. There has now been a significant 
increase (6397 pharmacists in 2008) in the 
pharmacist 
workforce 
since 
the 
country's 
independence 52 years ago, with 500 pharmacists 
expected to graduate annually from the country's 14 
schools of pharmacy. 4 Despite this increase, there 
remains substantial government reluctance to 
change the physicians' role due to the perceived 
negative public benefit. 5 </p>

<p>Overview of Malaysia Health Care System </p>

<p>Health care in Malaysia is provided by both public 
and private sectors. The public sector health care is 
heavily funded by the government, and the patient's 
co-payment only covers 3% of the cost of providing 
the service. However, due to its accessibility and 
convenience, there is an increasing demand for 
private health care, especially in the primary care 
sector, with more than 50% of the primary care 
contact occurring in the private sector. In addition, 
93% of private payments in Malaysia are paid out-
of-pocket, which is more than double the level found 
in high income countries. </p>

<p>6 </p>

<p>In Malaysia, all 
physicians in private practice are allowed to 
dispense medicine. Physicians dispense most of 
their prescriptions, and patients cannot choose to 
have their medications dispensed elsewhere. </p>

<p>Rationale of the Study </p>

<p>In most countries that have separated prescribing 
and dispensing, the dispensing service fee is set as 
a percentage mark-up system or a fee for service, 
which is based on government negotiation or 
previous utilisation rates. 7 Although this fee can be 
used as a proxy for the value of the dispensing 
service, it does not reflect the real value or the 
preference of the society for the service. In light of 
this concern about the value of such dispensing 
services and the public health importance of such 
information, an empirical study to assess the value 
of the pharmacists' dispensing service from the 
general public's perspective is urgently needed. </p>

<p>A number of studies were published previously that 
assess the willingness to pay (WTP) for pharmacy 
service. It has been found that 36 -85% of the </p>

<p>public are willing to pay for the type of pharmacy 
service in question. 
8,9 The amount that the public 
are willing to pay ranged from 4.02 USD for 
pharmacy service that reduced medication-related 
problems 9 to 40 USD for pharmacist-provided 
menopause and hormone replacement therapy 
consultations. 
9 In this WTP or contingent valuation 
method, the respondents were asked to think about 
the contingency for a program and reveal the 
maximum amount they would be willing to pay for 
such a program. 
10 However, most of the studies 
only evaluated a specific or expanded pharmacy 
service rather than the basic dispensing service. In 
addition, these studies were based in countries 
where the pharmacist dispensing role is separated 
and well established. </p>

<p>Therefore, this preliminary study aims to assess the 
WTP for pharmacists' dispensing service among the 
general population in the state of Penang, Malaysia. 
This information can be used as a direct measure of 
the monetary value for dispensing through 
pharmacist. It can be used from normative 
perspective in a cost-benefit analysis that would 
inform policy makers about the social desirability of 
dispensing by pharmacist as compared to 
dispensing by doctors. 11 This could serve as a 
potential framework to those undertaking a similar 
task in countries that are still in the process of 
separating the prescribing and dispensing roles. 
This information can also be used to construct 
demand curve in a behavioural perspective (market 
research). </p>

<p>METHODS </p>

<p>Study Design </p>

<p>A cross-sectional pilot survey on the general 
population's WTP for pharmacy dispensing service 
was designed and targeted for the population in the 
state of Penang, one of the 14 states in Malaysia. 
For the purpose of this pilot study, the convenience 
sampling technique was used to recruit only 
Malaysian adults from various strategic locations in 
five main shopping complexes in May 2008. Out of 
126 potential participants approached, only 100 
agreed to participate in this study. </p>

<p>In order to calculate an appropriate initial bidding 
amount for pharmacy dispensing, the survey was 
preceded by a cross-sectional micro-costing 
analysis of ten conveniently sampled community 
pharmacies in Penang. </p>

<p>Cost Analysis of the Dispensing Cost </p>

<p>A 17-item self-administered questionnaire was 
developed to assess the resources used for the cost 
analysis of the dispensing activities. The 
questionnaire was divided into three sections: 
information about the pharmacists, the non-
pharmacist staff, and the pharmacy. The 
questionnaires were completed by the person in 
charge of the community pharmacy, which could be 
either the pharmacist or manager of the pharmacy. </p>

<p>The cost analysis was performed to calculate the 
dispensing cost per minute in a community 
pharmacy. This was calculated as the sum of the </p>

state of Penang, Malaysia. Pharmacy Practice (Granada) 2010 Apr-Jun;8(2):116-121. </p>

<p>monthly pharmacist cost, the pharmacy overhead 
cost, and the equipment cost, divided by the 
pharmacy monthly open hours. The resources 
included were the pharmacist's salary, the size of 
the dispensing area, the non-pharmacist staff's 
salary, rent, electricity, water, phone, security, 
insurance, furniture, and computer system. </p>

<p>The exact time of the furniture investment, computer 
system, and security installation for the different 
pharmacies was unknown. Thus, an assumption 
was made where all of these items were purchased 
or installed at the same time. It was calculated as 
an equivalent cost with a 4.45 annuity factor with 
the assumption that the items had been in use for 
five years and had 4% annual depreciation. </p>

<p>10 </p>

<p>The dispensing cost per minute was then multiplied 
with the dispensing time per prescription, which was 
estimated by the pharmacists to be 15 minutes per 
prescription. </p>

<p>Instrument Assessing WTP </p>

<p>The willingness to pay for dispensing service was 
assessed using a 13-item questionnaire, which was 
prepared in both Malay (Malaysia national 
language) and English based on past literature and 
group discussion. The questionnaire was later 
assessed for its face and content validity by two 
pharmacy practice experts. The three-part 
questionnaire was divided into Section A, which 
collected patient demographic information (gender, 
age, income, education, and occupation); Section B, 
which assessed the public's knowledge about the 
pharmacist's dispensing service (frequency of 
pharmacy visits, experience in filling prescriptions in 
the pharmacy, awareness of the six specific 
activities of pharmacist dispensing); and Section C, 
which used contingent valuation interviews to 
assess the ex-post WTP for a pharmacist's 
dispensing service among the general population. In 
section B, the public's knowledge was assessed by 
asking the participants to select the activities that 
they think are involved in pharmacist's prescription 
dispensing role. </p>

<p>The contingent valuation (CV) method in section C 
was performed using a bidding game approach 
administered by face-to-face interviews with the 
participants. The participants were presented with a 
description of the pharmacist's dispensing service, 
the risk of medication error in prescriptions and its 
consequences, and the risk reduction of medication 
error associated with pharmacist intervention 12 
(Table 1). They were then asked a series of 
questions regarding the likelihood for them to pay 
for the pharmacist's dispensing service and the 
maximum amount they were willing to pay. </p>

<p>10 </p>

<p>Based on the initial dispensing cost analysis, the 
bidding began with an initial value of 10MYR 
(2.86USD; 1MYR=0.35 USD). If the participant 
agreed to pay for the value, the amount willing to 
pay was increased by 2MYR (0.57USD) to 12MYR 
(3.43USD). An increment of 2MYR (0.57USD) was 
added to the last bidding value each time the 
participant agreed to the suggested amount, until 
the bidding reached an amount they were not willing 
to pay for or until the bidding reached the maximum </p>

<p>of 30MYR (8.57USD). If the participant was still 
willing to pay for the maximum value of 30MYR 
(8.57USD), an open-ended question was given that 
asked the maximum amount the participant is willing 
to pay for the pharmacists' dispensing service. </p>

<p>However, if the participant refused to pay the initial 
bidding amount of 10MYR (2.86USD), a reduction 
of 2MYR (0.57USD) was offered every time the 
participant refused to pay for the service. The 
bidding amount was reduced until an agreeable 
amount was reached. </p>

<p>Analysis </p>

<p>All analysis was done using <rs id="software-0" type="software">STATA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">9.1</rs>. The 
outcome variables were the dispensing cost, 
willingness to pay, and amount willing to pay for the 
community pharmacists' dispensing service. Cost 
was only analysed descriptively. The participant's 
knowledge of pharmacist dispensing was calculated 
as the percentage of the activities that the customer 
selected from the list of activities outlined in Section 
B. The Chi-square and Fisher's exact test were 
used to assess the factors associated with the 
participants' WTP. The Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-
Wallis, and Spearman correlation tests were used to 
assess the factors associated with the amount the 
participants' were willing to pay for the pharmacists' 
dispensing service. For all statistical tests 
performed, the significance level was set a priori at 
P&lt;0.05. </p>

<p>Table 1. Description of the nature and benefit of the 
pharmacists' dispensing service. 
Assume that you are taking your prescription to a 
pharmacy for filling. At first, the pharmacist will screen 
your prescription to identify any potential medication 
errors, including incorrect medicine usage or possibility of 
the medicine in the prescription interacting with your 
condition or other medicine you are taking. 
Research has found that three out of ten prescriptions 
have medication errors. It is important to identify and solve 
these problems because they will lead to adverse 
reactions, such as rash, diarrhoea or reduced 
effectiveness of the medicine. Other research by the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) found that there is at least 
one death per day and 1.3 million people are injured each 
year due to medication errors, including wrong medicine 
and improper dose. 
Here, the role of the pharmacist is to assist you in the 
prevention of the undesired outcomes by correcting any 
medication errors through professional screening, 
counselling and evaluation. The Jonna Briggs Institute in 
Australia has found that community pharmacists can 
reduce the risk of medication errors by 20%. </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>Dispensing Cost Analysis </p>

<p>For this study, 15 pharmacies were approached, 
and 10 agreed to participate in the study. In this 
study, nine (90%) of the participating pharmacies 
held a retail license, while the remaining pharmacy 
was a retail and wholesale license holder. There 
were only three pharmacies that had a personal 
office for the pharmacists. Six of the pharmacists 
graduated from a local public university, two 
graduated from a private local university, and the 
rest graduated from universities based overseas. </p>

<p>Of the total pharmacy dispensing cost, 38.1% was 
attributed to the pharmacist's salary, followed by 
rental costs, which was 24.9%, and then the non-
pharmacist staff's salary, which was 23.3%. The 
mean dispensing cost per minute was estimated to 
be 0.39 MYR (SD=0.08MYR). The minimum cost 
per minute was 0.31 MYR (0.09USD) with a 
maximum of 0.47 MYR (0.13USD). Assuming that 
the dispensing time was 15 minutes, the dispensing 
cost per prescription was estimated to be 5.87 MYR 
(1.68USD). The starting bid for the willingness to 
pay study was later calculated based on the 
conservative 40% mark-up of a 15-minute 
prescription. </p>

<p>Willingness to Pay for a Pharmacist's Dispensing 
Service </p>

<p>A total of 100 Penangites participated in this study 
with a mean survey completion time of 6.5 minutes 
(SD=1.2). Of the participants, 51% were women, 
and 57% were aged between 18 and 35 years old. 
A household income of more than 1,000 MYR 
(285.71USD) per month was reported by 46% of the 
participants. Most of the participants (54%) were 
educated to the tertiary education level, and 31% of 
the participants were unemployed. In addition, 8% 
of the participants had never visited a community 
pharmacy. Only 18% of the participants had more 
than 67% knowledge about the pharmacist's 
dispensing activities. Concerning the dispensing 
activities, 34 participants knew that the pharmacists 
validate prescriptions, 32 participants knew that 
pharmacists check prescriptions for interactions, 42 
participants knew that pharmacists solve medicine-
related problems, 52 participants knew that 
pharmacists provide counselling, 16 participants 
knew that pharmacists document the dispensing 
activity, and 22 participants knew that pharmacists 
do drug monitoring as part of their dispensing role. </p>

<p>When asked about their willingness to pay, 67% of 
the participants were willing to pay for the 
pharmacists' dispensing service. Their willingness 
to pay for the service was found to be similar across 
gender, age, and education level (Table 2). 
However, the willingness to pay was found to be 
significantly different between different income 
groups (p&lt;0.05). </p>

<p>The median (IQR) amount that the participants were 
willing to pay for a community pharmacist's 
dispensing service was 10 MYR (8 MYR, 16 MYR). 
No statistically significant association was found 
between the participants' demographic factors and 
the amount they were willing to pay (Table 3). The 
Spearman correlation test showed that participants' 
WTP amount for the pharmacist's dispensing 
service was moderately correlated with their 
knowledge of the community pharmacist's 
dispensing services (r=0.377, p=0.02). </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>This pilot study was carried out to measure the 
amount the Malaysian public was WTP for a 
pharmacist's dispensing service. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first study that has pursued 
such a research question in a non-separated 
prescribing/dispensing practice. </p>

<p>Of the participants, 67% were willing to pay for the 
pharmacists' dispensing service. In comparison, the 
percent of people that are willing to pay for a 
pharmacist's service in the literature ranges from 
36-85%. </p>

<p>8,9 </p>

<p>The high percent found here is 
impressive considering the largely negative media 
coverage on the dispensing separation proposal in 
Malaysia, and this suggests that the Malaysian 
public do appreciate the benefit of the pharmacists' 
dispensing service. Furthermore, the Malaysian 
consumer group association 
13 has publicly thrown </p>

<p>its support behind the proposal, and this study 
finding may be a reflection of public sentiment. </p>

<p>This study found that neither demographic factors 
(except income) nor knowledge about the 
pharmacists' activities were associated with the 
participants' willingness to pay. One possible 
explanation for this observation is that the 
Malaysian public may not feel comfortable paying 
out-of-pocket for health services that are usually 
free or included in the physician's fee; however, this 
was not explored in the present study. The 
mechanism of payment for dispensing the service 
was not stated in the survey, and this may have 
influenced the participants' negative decision, not 
because they do not value the service, but because 
they feel that their insurance should cover it. </p>

<p>8,10 </p>

<p>Thus, to reduce this strategic bias, future research 
should include a description of the payment 
mechanism and perhaps form the question using an 
ex ante approach that would frame the outcome in 
an uncertain term. </p>

<p>This study found that the societal value of the 
pharmacist's dispensing service was 10 MYR 
(2.86USD), which is considerably enough to cover 
the cost of providing such a service. This is a 
reasonable amount, especially considering that it is 
also far lower than the average Malaysian 
physician's consultation fee (which is 30 MYR). 
However, caution should be taken as the estimated 
value could be the result of starting point bias, 
which is the bias introduced by the first bid into the 
monetary valuation. 
14 Although this study does not 
analyse the effect of this bias, the value found 
coincides with the first bid given to the participants. </p>

<p>No demographic factors were found to be 
associated with the amount the participants were 
willing to pay, despite evidence of age association 
by Suh. 
8 However, evidence about the age 
association with the amount people are willing to 
pay for a health service is very inconsistent, with 
some studies pointing to a similar finding with the 
present study. 15 Some studies have found a 
significant relationship between income and the 
amount people are willing to pay. 
9,16 However, this 
was not found in our study, similar to a few other </p>

<p>studies. 
8,17 We believe these findings may be 
caused by the negligible amount in the questions as 
compared to other professional service charges in 
this country. However, this study also found that the 
more knowledgeable the consumers were about the 
pharmacist's dispensing service, the higher 
amounts they were willing to pay for the service. 
Once the consumers have more knowledge of the 
pharmacist's dispensing service, they will have 
better insight about the role that the pharmacists 
play in providing the service, which results in a 
higher value for the service. </p>

<p>One of the limitations of this study is that the small 
convenience sample that was used limits its 
generalisation to the whole Malaysian population. 
The Penang state itself is generally an urbanised 
and high income state, which might not reflect the 
other Malaysia states that have higher rural and 
lower income populations. </p>

<p>In addition, the fact that individuals indicated that 
they would be willing to pay a certain amount does 
not mean that they would actually do so in a real-life 
situation. However, validation with real-life data is 
difficult to perform, though a variable starting 
amount could be used in future research to reduce 
this bias. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS </p>

<p>This study suggests that the general public values 
the pharmacist's dispensing service. Although no 
demographic factors influenced this decision, the 
public understanding of the pharmacist's dispensing 
services was found to positively influence the 
amount they are willing to pay. Therefore, there is a 
need for an intensive education campaign to be 
carried out to educate the general public about the 
pharmacist's role in the dispensing service in order 
to improve the acceptance of such a change among 
the general public. </p>

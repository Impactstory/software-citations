<p>as the difference between the drug added in the loading 
solution and the drug content remaining in solution after 
incubation with FNPs. All experiments were performed 
in triplicate. 
The release rate of resveratrol from the silk FNPs in 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was also evaluated. Briefly, 
25 mg of dried RL-FNPs were dispersed in 25 mL of PBS 1× 
(pH 7.4) in a 50 mL Falcon™ tube and then maintained at 
37°C with gentle agitation. At different times of incubation, 
samples were centrifuged until the supernatants were clear, 
and then aliquots of 150 μL of supernatant were withdrawn 
from the incubation medium, centrifuged at 18,000 g to 
remove residual FNPs, and measured for resveratrol con-
centration as described above. Samples were diluted to the 
calibration range (0.5-25 μg/mL) with ethanol (ethanol/PBS 
9:1). Each assay was performed in triplicate, including a 
negative control of PBS without RL-FNPs. After sampling, 
an equal volume of fresh PBS was immediately added to 
the incubation medium. The amount of resveratrol released 
from the nanoparticles was expressed as a percentage of the 
total resveratrol loaded in the nanoparticles and was plotted 
as a function of time. </p>

<p>Bioactivity of RL-FNPs in RAW 264.7 cells </p>

<p>RAW 264.7 cells (mouse macrophage cells) were obtained 
from the Cell Culture Unit of the University of Granada 
(Granada, Spain) and cultured in Dulbecco's Modified 
Eagle's Medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal 
bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-glutamine, in a humidified 
5% CO 2 atmosphere at 37°C. The RAW 264.7 cells were 
seeded onto 96-well plates, at a density of 5×10 5 cells per 
well, and grown until confluence. They were cultured for 
2 hours with each concentration of the nanoparticles (100, 
250, and 500 μg/mL) (alone or loaded with resveratrol) and 
then stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 ng/mL); 
similarly, positive and negative controls were also used, 
including three concentrations of resveratrol (12, 20, and 
60 μg/mL) -which correspond to the maximal release that 
could be obtained with each concentration of the RL-FNPs 
assayed. After 20 hours, the supernatants were collected 
and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 minutes: the nitrite levels, 
as an indirect marker of inducible nitric oxide synthase 
(iNOS) activity, were measured using the Griess assay. 23 Cell 
viability was examined using the cell cytotoxicity 3-(4,5-
dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide 
(MTT) assay kit test (CellTiter 96 ® AQueous One Solution 
Cell Proliferation Assay; Promega Corporation, Madison, 
WI, USA) as described elsewhere. 24 </p>

<p>In vivo evaluation of the bioactivity 
of RL-FNPs in the TNBS model of rat 
colitis </p>

<p>This study was carried out in accordance with the "Guide for 
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals", as promulgated by 
the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the protocols 
were approved by the Ethics Committee of Laboratory Ani-
mals of the University of Granada (Spain) (reference number 
CEEA-2010-286). Female Wistar rats (180-200 g) obtained 
from Janvier Labs (St Berthevin, France) were housed in 
Makrolon ® cages and maintained in an air-conditioned 
atmosphere with a 12/12 hour light-dark cycle, and they 
were provided with free access to tap water and food. The 
rats were randomly assigned to seven groups (n=10). An 
untreated TNBS control group and a noncolitic group were 
included for reference: they received only the vehicle used to 
administer the test compounds. The treatments tested were: 
a) unloaded FNPs, at the dose of 8 mg/rat; b) resveratrol, at 
the dose of 1 mg/rat; c) resveratrol encapsulated in FNPs 
(RL-FNPs), at the ratio of 1 mg in 8 mg nanoparticles/rat; 
and d) dexamethasone, at the dose of 0.1 mg/rat. All the treat-
ments were incorporated in carboxymethylcellulose (0.5% 
w/v) in water and administered intrarectally. 
Colonic inflammation was induced in the control and 
treated groups as previously described. 25 Briefly, rats were 
fasted overnight, anesthetized with halothane, and given 
10 mg of TNBS dissolved in 0.25 mL of 50% ethanol (v/v), 
by means of a Teflon cannula inserted 8 cm through the anus. 
During and after TNBS administration, the rats were kept in a 
head-down position until they recovered from the anesthesia 
and were then returned to their cages. Rats from the non-
colitic group were administered, intracolonically, 0.25 mL of 
PBS, instead of TNBS. The four treatments described were 
administered from the day following the colitis induction 
until the day before the death of the rats, which took place 
8 days after the induction of the colonic damage. All the rats 
were killed with an overdose of halothane. The animal body 
weights, occurrence of diarrhea, and water and food intake 
were recorded daily throughout all the experiments. Once the 
animals had been killed, the colon was removed aseptically, 
placed on an ice-cooled plate, opened longitudinally, and 
cleaned of its luminal contents with cold saline. Afterwards, 
the colonic segment was weighed and its length measured. 
Each colon was scored for macroscopically visible damage, 
on a 0-10 scale, by two observers unaware of the treatment, 
according to the criteria previously reported. 25 Then, the 
colonic samples were sectioned in different longitudinal frag-
ments to be used for biochemical determinations or for RNA </p>

<p>The DLC varied, depending on the feeding ratio. By vary-
ing the feeding ratio of FNPs and resveratrol, the highest </p>

<p>DLC and EE of resveratrol in the nanoparticles were 
11.6%±0.2% (2.89 mg of resveratrol loaded in 25 mg of 
FNPs) and 33.3%±0.2%, respectively. The DLC obtained is 
similar to that found by Shao et al 29 in a polyethyleneglycol-
polycaprolactone copolymer (PEG/PCL), mPEG4k-PCL20k, 
with a loading content of resveratrol near to 20%, but the 
EE in our study was far below their value (more than 90%). 
Although it is difficult to compare the properties of differ-
ent materials, such as silk and PEG/PCL copolymer, this 
low efficiency reached by the FNPs is probably due to the 
hydrophobicity of resveratrol. 29 The amount of resveratrol 
loaded in the particles was a function of its concentration in 
the incubation solution, the maximum loading being reached 
at a concentration of 25 mg/mL in ethanol. </p>

<p>Release of resveratrol from RL-FNPs </p>

<p>Resveratrol has very low solubility (0.11-0.3 mg/L) in aque-
ous media (simulated intestinal fluid or PBS). 30 Our RL-FNPs 
showed curves of liberation with an initial burst, reaching 
resveratrol saturation of the aqueous medium in 3-4 hours 
and maintaining a resveratrol concentration higher than 
15 mg/L in PBS medium over a period of 80 hours. Con-
sidering a volume of 25 mL of PBS, 0.5 mg of resveratrol 
was released initially until medium saturation was reached. 
Taking into account that the DLC of FNPs is about 12%, 
less than 20% of the loaded resveratrol was released in the 
initial burst. Adsorbed resveratrol was stable upon degrada-
tion, and the RL-FNPs showed a prolonged release over 
80 hours (Figure 4). </p>

<p>Bioactivity of RL-FNPs in RAW 264.7 cells </p>

<p>In this assay, we aimed to characterize the immunomodu-
latory properties of RL-FNPs in an in vitro model of cells 
involved in the immune response: the RAW 264.7 cell line 
of mouse macrophages. It is interesting to note that cell 
viability was not affected by any of the treatments used (not 
shown). In the absence of LPS stimulation, the treatment of 
these cells with the different concentrations of the nanopar-
ticles resulted in a progressive increase in the production of 
nitrite (Figure 5A). Similarly, the RL-FNPs also promoted 
the release of nitrite in the cell culture, although to a lesser </p>

<p>extent than with the nanoparticles alone. In addition, res-
veratrol was also able to significantly increase the nitrite 
production in basal conditions, when compared with the 
corresponding control, although no concentration-dependent 
effect was obtained. When RAW 264.7 macrophages were 
incubated with LPS, enhanced production of nitrite took 
place, as well as its accumulation in the culture media, due 
to increased expression of iNOS in these cells (Figure 5B). 
The pretreatment with resveratrol-unloaded nanoparticles 
did not significantly modify nitrite levels in comparison with 
control conditions, whereas RL-FNPs, at concentrations of 
250 and 500 μg/mL, were able to reduce nitrite production. 
This inhibition was similar to that obtained when resveratrol 
was assayed at the lowest concentration studied but lower 
than those achieved when the macrophages were incubated 
with higher concentrations of resveratrol (Figure 5B). </p>

<p>In vivo evaluation of the bioactivity 
of RL-FNPs in the TNBS model 
of rat colitis </p>

<p>The aim of this experiment was to verify whether the incor-
poration of resveratrol (1 mg) in the nanoparticles of fibroin 
(8 mg) had an additional anti-inflammatory effect in vivo, 
in comparison with the administration of nanoparticles or 
resveratrol alone. Also, the effects were compared to those 
obtained after intracolonic administration of the glucocorti-
coid dexamethasone (0.1 mg), one of the standard therapies 
in human IBD. 
The macroscopic evaluation of the colonic specimens 
revealed that most of the experimental groups showed an </p>

<p>intestinal anti-inflammatory effect, the exception being those 
colitic animals that received resveratrol alone. This beneficial 
effect was evidenced by a significant reduction of the colonic 
weight/length ratio in comparison with the nontreated group, 
which indicates an improvement of the edema associated with 
the inflamed tissue (Table 3). At the same time, a significant 
reduction in the length of the inflamed/ulcerated colonic tis-
sue was observed 8 days after the administration of TNBS, 
with lower values in the macroscopic score (Table 3). It is 
interesting to note that the effect of the FNPs, alone or loaded 
with resveratrol, was similar to that obtained with the intra-
colonic administration of dexamethasone (Table 3). 
The beneficial effect shown macroscopically was 
also evident in the evaluation of the different biochemi-
cal parameters in the colonic tissue. The treatment of the 
colitic animals with the nanoparticles, alone or resveratrol-
loaded, was associated with a significant reduction of 
the activity of the colonic MPO, probably due to a lesser 
infiltration of leukocytes into the inflamed tissue (Table 3). 
However, it is important to note that the reduction was sig-
nificantly higher when the nanoparticles were loaded with 
resveratrol, showing a similar activity to dexamethasone 
(Table 3). At the same time, the treatment with the RL-
FNPs significantly increased the glutathione content, which 
indicates an improvement of the altered oxidative state that 
was the result of the inflammatory process induced by the 
TNBS, showing significant differences from the group of 
animals that received the unloaded nanoparticles. Again, 
this effect was similar to that observed in the group of rats 
that received dexamethasone (Table 3). </p>

<p>Resveratrol-loaded silk fibroin nanoparticles in TNBS rat colitis </p>

<p>The analysis of the markers related to the alteration of 
the immune response (and associated with the intestinal 
inflammatory process) showed that the treatment of the 
colitic animals with the RL-FNPs significantly reduced the 
expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12, with an efficacy 
similar to that of the group receiving dexamethasone, except 
for IL-12 (Figure 6). The administration of unloaded nano-
particles significantly inhibited the expression of IL-6 and 
IL-12, whereas resveratrol alone only had a significant effect 
on the expression of TNF-α (Figure 6). 
Similarly, the administration of the RL-FNPs to the rats 
suffering the intestinal inflammation was associated with a 
significant reduction of the expression of the chemokines 
CINC-1 and MCP-1, this inhibition being similar to that 
achieved when resveratrol was administered. Unloaded 
nanoparticles were only able to reduce significantly the 
expression of MCP-1, whereas dexamethasone did not inhibit 
the expression of either of the two chemokines evaluated 
(Figure 7). On the other hand, the expression of the adhesion 
molecule ICAM-1 was also inhibited after treatment with the 
RL-FNPs, resveratrol, or dexamethasone; however, unloaded 
nanoparticles were devoid of any significant inhibitory effect 
on this proinflammatory marker (Figure 7). 
Finally, the evaluation of the markers related to the pre-
servation of the barrier function of the intestinal epithelium, 
like the mucins MUC-2 and MUC-3, as well as TFF-3 and 
villin, showed that only the treatment with RL-FNPs was 
associated with a significant increment in their expression, 
in comparison with the untreated colitic group, similar to the 
effects observed with dexamethasone (Figure 8). However, 
unloaded nanoparticles or resveratrol did not significantly 
modify the expression of these proteins, in comparison 
with control colitic rats. The recovery of the function of the </p>

<p>epithelial barrier was observed also in the group of colitic 
animals treated with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone, 
supporting the similar intestinal anti-inflammatory effect 
obtained with both treatments (Figure 8). </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>The results described in the present study indicate that it is 
possible to encapsulate the stilbene resveratrol in nanopar-
ticles made from silk fibroin. This encapsulation results from 
the adsorption of the drug onto the surface of the particles. 
Given that resveratrol has a small charge, the EE of about 
13% is quite low in comparison with other encapsulation 
approaches and materials for this compound. 31 However, 
even at this low level of encapsulation, the loaded nanopar-
ticles showed a significant and remarkable biological effect -
both in vitro, in a macrophage cell line, and in vivo, in a rat 
model of experimental colitis. The in vitro assays revealed 
the immunomodulatory properties of the FNPs when they 
contained resveratrol, since only in this case were they able 
to both promote the macrophage activity when the cells were 
in basal conditions, and inhibit it when stimulated with LPS. 
These effects are similar to those found when resveratrol 
was tested alone in these in vitro assays. In fact, previous 
studies have reported that resveratrol, although slightly 
enhancing iNOS mRNA in a concentration-dependent man-
ner, decreased nitric oxide production in activated RAW 
264.7 macrophages. 32 
The in vivo experiments show that the daily intracolonic 
administration of 1 mg of resveratrol encapsulated in 8 mg 
of FNPs per rat had an intestinal anti-inflammatory effect in 
the experimental model of rat colitis induced by the intraco-
lonic administration of the hapten TNBS, this effect being 
similar to that obtained with the intrarectal administration </p>

<p>of dexamethasone -a glucocorticoid used as a positive 
control, and one of the therapies available for the treatment 
of human IBD. 33 Previous study has reported the intestinal 
anti-inflammatory effect of resveratrol in this experimental 
model of rat colitis. 21 However, our study reveals that the 
incorporation of this compound into FNPs resulted in an 
improvement of its biological properties because the effect 
observed with RL-FNPs was greater than that obtained when 
the resveratrol or the nanoparticles were administered alone, 
suggesting a synergistic action in the encapsulated product. It 
is important to note that the FNPs cannot be considered as an 
inert carrier in experimental colitis since they had an intestinal 
anti-inflammatory effect, thus confirming previous observa-
tions with this biomaterial, both in vivo and in vitro. 16,18 
The synergistic effect obtained in the RL-FNPs was evi-
denced macroscopically since the lowest damage score was 
obtained in this group of colitic rats. It is noteworthy that the 
intestinal anti-inflammatory effects were related to the better </p>

<p>recovery of the colonic tissue produced by the treatments in 
comparison with the colitic control; this ruled out a preventa-
tive effect of the treatments since the administration of the 
different test compounds only started once the damage had 
been induced. The higher efficacy obtained with RL-FNPs 
was also demonstrated biochemically as a significantly lower 
reduction in colonic MPO activity in comparison with the 
colitic groups receiving resveratrol or the nanoparticles alone, 
probably related to a reduction of neutrophil infiltration and 
thus demonstrating the superior intestinal anti-inflammatory 
effect of the treatment. 34 
Moreover, it is precisely in this group of animals where 
the anti-inflammatory effects were associated with a sig-
nificant improvement in most of the markers related to 
the alteration of the immune response resulting from the 
intestinal injury induced by the TNBS. 35 In fact, RL-FNP 
administration was the only treatment able to significantly 
inhibit the expression of all the cytokines evaluated, namely </p>

<p>TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-12. This may be relevant since 
the expression of these proinflammatory cytokines has been 
reported to be increased in human IBD, and the effect of 
these cytokines on the intestine has been directly related to 
the induction of tissue injury and/or destruction. 36 Closely 
associated with the improvement in the immune response 
produced by the different treatments are their effects on the 
chemokines CINC-1 and MCP-1 as well as on the adhesion 
molecule ICAM-1, which could be responsible for the lower 
neutrophil infiltration (which in turn, coincided consistently 
with the lower activity of colonic MPO obtained with the 
treatments) and the decline in monocytes/macrophages in the 
inflamed tissue. This could play a key role in the intestinal 
anti-inflammatory effect because it has been well described 
that in the first steps of the gut inflammation, margination 
and extravasation of circulating leukocytes probably result 
in the perpetuation of the inflammatory process. 37 </p>

<p>Also of note is the significant effect of the more active 
treatments, RL-FNPs and dexamethasone, on the improve-
ment of the intestinal epithelium barrier function, as evi-
denced by increased expression of the mucins MUC-2 and 
MUC-3, the primary constituents of the colonic mucus 
layer, 38 and of TFF-3 and villin, the bioactive peptides 
involved in epithelial protection and repair. 39,40 This can 
be key to explaining the greater anti-inflammatory effect 
obtained with RL-FNP treatment in comparison with free 
resveratrol and unloaded nanoparticles -this could be one 
of the mechanisms that promotes the mucus-secreting layer 
that covers the epithelium and acts as a physical barrier, pro-
tecting its integrity and making possible a faster recovery of 
the injured colonic tissue. Epithelial barrier function impair-
ment is considered as one of the initial steps in intestinal 
inflammation that facilitates the access of antigens from the 
intestinal lumen and hence, generates an exacerbated immune </p>

<p>response. This effect seems to be of special relevance since 
it has been stated recently that mucosal healing is a key 
prognostic parameter in the management of IBD; in fact, 
mucosal healing has emerged as a key treatment goal in IBD 
that predicts sustained clinical remission. 41 </p>

<p>Conclusion </p>

<p>Silk FNPs constitute an attractive strategy for the controlled 
release of resveratrol. This is even more the case when one 
considers first the low bioavailability of resveratrol, both in 
animals and humans, and second, its low water solubility, 
which hinders its administration since it would need the 
use of an organic solvent (ie, dimethyl sulfoxide, acetone, 
or ethanol) that is not suitable for drug delivery. However, 
further studies, to improve its stability during gastric passage </p>

<p>and to delay drug release to the distal intestine, are needed in 
order to allow the oral administration of this nanoparticulate 
formulation. </p>

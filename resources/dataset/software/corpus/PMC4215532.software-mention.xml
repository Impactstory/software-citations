<p>Computer-aided diagnosis of Alzheimer3s disease (AD) is a rapidly developing field of neuroimaging with strong 
potential to be used in practice. In this context, assessment of models3 robustness to noise and imaging protocol 
differences together with post-processing and tuning strategies are key tasks to be addressed in order to move 
towards successful clinical applications. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of Random Forest classifiers 
trained using different structural MRI measures, with and without neuroanatomical constraints in the detection 
and prediction of AD in terms of accuracy and between-cohort robustness. 
From The ADNI database, 185 AD, and 225 healthy controls (HC) were randomly split into training and testing 
datasets. 165 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were distributed according to the month of 
conversion to dementia (4-year follow-up). Structural 1.5-T MRI-scans were processed using Freesurfer segmen-
tation and cortical reconstruction. Using the resulting output, AD/HC classifiers were trained. Training included 
model tuning and performance assessment using out-of-bag estimation. Subsequently the classifiers were vali-
dated on the AD/HC test set and for the ability to predict MCI-to-AD conversion. Models3 between-cohort robust-
ness was additionally assessed using the AddNeuroMed dataset acquired with harmonized clinical and imaging 
protocols. 
In the ADNI set, the best AD/HC sensitivity/specificity (88.6%/92.0% -test set) was achieved by combining corti-
cal thickness and volumetric measures. The Random Forest model resulted in significantly higher accuracy com-
pared to the reference classifier (linear Support Vector Machine). The models trained using parcelled and high-
dimensional (HD) input demonstrated equivalent performance, but the former was more effective in terms of 
computation/memory and time costs. The sensitivity/specificity for detecting MCI-to-AD conversion (but not 
AD/HC classification performance) was further improved from 79.5%/75%-83.3%/81.3% by a combination of mor-
phometric measurements with ApoE-genotype and demographics (age, sex, education). When applied to the in-
dependent AddNeuroMed cohort, the best ADNI models produced equivalent performance without substantial 
accuracy drop, suggesting good robustness sufficient for future clinical implementation.

<p>The application of pattern recognition approaches to neuroimaging 
offers the potential for diagnostically relevant analysis techniques, in 
particular for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which has already 
been demonstrated to provide relevant support in the diagnosis of 
Alzheimer3s disease (AD) (O3Brien, 2007). A large number of studies ad-
dressing the use of pattern recognition methods in image-based detec-
tion of AD have been published in recent years (Gray et al., 2013; Liu 
et al., 2012; Cuingnet et al., 2011; Klöppel et al., 2008). 
The advantage of these methods over visual assessment by a medi-
cal expert is that they are fully automated and therefore unbiased to-
wards human mistakes and can be incorporated into computerized 
medical decision-support systems, a growing field with especially fast 
research progress in radiology (Stivaros et al., 2010; Belle et al., 2013). 
However, such methods do have limitations. Our previous work dem-
onstrated that pattern recognition methods are sensitive to MR-protocol 
differences (Westman et al., 2011; Lebedev et al., 2013) and that a harmo-
nization step is therefore required. Another relevant issue pertains to the 
comparison of high-dimensional imaging data input versus measure-
ments extracted by neuroanatomical parcellation atlases, with the areas 
separated according to functional and histological maps of the human 
cortex (for simplicity, we will use the term "parcelled data"). Parcelled 
input has some obvious advantages in terms of lower computation, mem-
ory cost and processing time. However, it is possible that it could be bi-
ased by these landmarks. Normalized high-dimensional measurements 
without parcellation, in contrast, are unbiased, but at the same time are 
more difficult to handle using multivariate and machine learning ap-
proaches due to computation and memory costs. Moreover, situations 
where the number of measurements is much larger than the number of 
observations (p ≫ n) are often associated with the so-called "curse of di-
mensionality" (Bellman, 1961). This refers to a number of events that 
happen when dealing with high-dimensional input (due to increasing 
sparsity of the data), significantly hampering modeling efficacy. Such 
cases often require a preparatory step of dimensionality reduction. 
Random Forest (RF) is an ensemble machine learning algorithm, 
which is best defined as a "combination of tree predictors such that 
each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled inde-
pendently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest" 
(Breiman, 2001). 
In many applications this algorithm produces one of the best accura-
cies to date and has important advantages over other techniques in 
terms of ability to handle highly non-linear biological data, robustness 
to noise, tuning simplicity (compared to other ensemble learning algo-
rithms) and opportunity for efficient parallel processing (De Bruyn 
et al., 2013; Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil, 2006; Menze et al., 2009). 
These factors also make RF an ideal candidate for handling high-
dimensional problems, where the number of features is often redun-
dant. Although RF can itself be considered as an effective feature selec-
tion algorithm, several approaches for feature set reduction within 
and outside the context of RF have been proposed to further improve 
its performance (Tuv et al., 2009). In the current study, we use recursive 
feature elimination (Kuhn, 2012a) to optimize the models. 
Our previous work revealed that parcelled cortical thickness togeth-
er with subcortical volumetric measurements (used as an input to a 
multivariate model) resulted in the best performance, compared to 
other modalities (Westman et al., 2013). Here, we aimed not only to 
assess the accuracies of the classifiers trained with different morpho-
metric modalities, but also to analyze the impact of dimensionality, 
parcellation strategy on models3 accuracy, computation/memory/time 
costs of model training and feature selection. Finally, previous studies 
have successfully employed pattern recognition techniques to classify </p>

<p>MRI images from different cohorts only within the combined sets 
(Westman et al., 2011; Lebedev et al., 2014). The present study was 
planned as one of the first to assess classifiers3 between-cohort robust-
ness in two independent large-scale datasets. 
We hypothesized that with the use of more disease-specific 
parcellation atlases (in this case, when the measurements are extracted 
from the predefined regions, known to be affected by Alzheimer3s dis-
ease), it would be possible to achieve AD-detection accuracy equivalent 
to that of the models trained with high-dimensional input without 
parcellation with shorter computational time. In addition, we hypothe-
sized that it is possible to achieve good between-cohort generalization 
of the models if the MRI protocols are harmonized. </p>

<p>2. Methods </p>

<p>2.1. Subjects </p>

<p>The study was based on two cohorts. The first set of clinical and MRI 
data was obtained from the Alzheimer3s Disease Neuroimaging Initia-
tive (ADNI-1) database (http://adni.loni.ucla.edu). In short, ADNI-1 in-
cludes more than 800 subjects with up to 5 years of annual follow-up 
with comprehensive clinical, neuropsychological, imaging and laborato-
ry evaluations, performed at the 57 specialized ADNI sites in North 
America. For details, see Aisen et al. (2010) and ADNI-Core (2011). 
The present cross-sectional study is focused on baseline imaging data 
and longitudinal information regarding conversion to dementia. 
In total, 3D T1 baseline brain scans from 809 subjects passed 
our image quality control criteria. From this group we selected 
575 subjects -185 AD, 225 healthy controls (HC) and 165 patients 
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and long term follow up infor-
mation -who met the inclusion criteria (see below). 
In order to test the impact of different cohorts, we additionally 
included 321 subjects (AD 107, 114 MCI and 100 HCs) from the 
AddNeuroMed study with harmonized clinical and imaging protocols 
(http://www.innomed-addneuromed.com/). The standardized study har-
monization workflow (described in previous publications) particularly 
included careful MR protocol alignment evaluated by phantom scan-
ning and careful quality control (Simmons et al., 2011). </p>

<p>2.2. Inclusion criteria and clinical assessment procedures </p>

<p>All AD patients met the NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for probable AD, had 
mild level of dementia, defined as the Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE) score between 20 and 26, and had the Clinical Dementia Rating 
(CDR) score of 1.0. 
Inclusion criteria for MCI were: 1) MMSE score between 24 and 30, 
2) memory complaints and objective memory impairment measured 
by the Logical Memory II subscale of the Wechsler Memory Scale (edu-
cation adjusted), 3) CDR of 0.5, 4) absence of significant levels of impair-
ment in other cognitive domains, 5) preserved activities of daily living, 
and 6) absence of dementia. MCI converters had to meet the criteria 
for Alzheimer3s disease during at least two sequential evaluations 
(e.g., at 24 and 36 month follow-ups). Those MCI subjects who did not 
have the required follow-up information or had their diagnoses changed 
back from AD to MCI (or to HC) were excluded (n = 232 out of 397). To 
consider MCI subjects as being non-converters we required that their clin-
ical status remained stable for at least 3 years of follow-up. 
Controls (general inclusion/exclusion criteria): 1) MMSE scores 
between 28 and 30, 2) CDR of 0, and 3) they did not meet the criteria 
for clinical depression at baseline, MCI or dementia within 3 years of 
follow-up. One HC subject (ID # 0223) was excluded from the sample 
due to conversion to AD at follow-up. One AD subject (ID # 0805) was </p>

<p> 
A.V. Lebedev et al. / NeuroImage: Clinical 6 (2014) 115-125 </p>

<p>excluded during the outlier detection procedure, leaving 575 subjects. 
Subjects were between 55 and 90 years of age. 
Apart from this, the standardized clinical evaluation protocol includ-
ed multi-test assessment of cognitive functions and neuropsychiatric 
symptoms, ApoE genotyping and some other procedures (for more de-
tails see http://www.adni-info.org/). </p>

<p>2.3. Subsampling </p>

<p>From the final ADNI cohort of 575 subjects, 150 AD patients and 
150 HCs were randomly selected, forming the training dataset, with 
the remaining AD 35 and 75 HC (coupled with 165 MCI patients) sub-
jects included in the testing dataset. 
MCI subjects were split into 6 subgroups according to the month of 
MCI-to-AD conversion during 4 years of follow-up (6th-, 12th-, 18th-, 
24th-, 36+th-month converters and non-converters). </p>

<p>2.4. Study ethics </p>

<p>The studies were approved by the local Regional Committees for 
Medical Research Ethics. All patients provided written consent to partic-
ipate in the study after the scheduled procedures had been explained in 
detail to the patient and a caregiver. All subjects were willing and able to 
undergo all study procedures including imaging and agreed to longitu-
dinal follow-up. </p>

<p>2.5. MRI </p>

<p>All subjects had 1.5 Tesla T1 3D MRI images acquired using the har-
monized ADNI-1 protocol (Jack et al., 2008). For details visit http://adni. 
loni.usc.edu. </p>

<p>2.6. Image post-processing </p>

<p>Image processing was performed at one site: Centre for Neuroimag-
ing Sciences, IoP (KCL). Image quality control was performed using stan-
dardized procedures (Simmons et al., 2011; Simmons et al., 2009). 
Next, the raw 3D T1 MRI data underwent processing for surface-based 
cortex reconstruction and volumetric segmentation using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">Freesurfer 
image analysis software</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="url">http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/</rs>/) version 5.1 
installed on a CentOS4 x86_64 cluster. There are several rationales for 
using Freesurfer in our study. Firstly, the surface-based registration ap-
proach incorporated into this software has been shown to have better re-
producibility compared to Laplacian-or Registration-based methods for 
cortical thickness estimation (Clarkson et al., 2011). Secondly, this frame-
work provides a range of different kinds of surface-based and volumetric 
measurements, as well as different parcellation atlases for extracting av-
eraged morphometric data. The steps of this processing are described in 
detail elsewhere (Ségonne et al., 2007; Ségonne et al., 2004; Fischl and 
Dale, 2000; Fischl et al., 1999; Dale et al., 1999; Sled et al., 1998). 
The surface-based pipeline produced several morphometric mo-
dalities (cortical thickness, Jacobian maps, and sulcal depth). After the 
Freesurfer steps, cortical models from each individual were registered 
to a spherical atlas, providing matching across subjects, and finally 
327,684 normalized measurements acquired for every subject were 
concatenated into large matrices (one for each high-dimensional mor-
phometric modality). 
41 volumetric measurements for all subjects were corrected for intra-
cranial volume (ICV) using linear modelling (removing linear effects of 
ICV) and finally concatenated into an n-by-41 matrix that was used in 
the subsequent analysis. 
The image post-processing and analysis steps are illustrated in 
Appendix: Fig. A1. </p>

<p>2.7. Statistical analysis </p>

<p>Statistical analysis was carried out using the R programming lan-
guage (R Core Team, 2012), version 2.15.1, on R-Cloud built on EBI 64-
bit Linux Cluster (Kapushesky et al., 2010). Demographic and clinical 
features were compared using parametric and non-parametric tests as 
appropriate. Principal component analysis (PCA) from the R 'base' pack-
age was used with visual inspection of PCA score-plot for the outlier de-
tection (Esbensen et al., 2002). One subject was excluded during this 
procedure (see Results). The 'randomForest' package (Liaw and Wiener, 
2002) was used in further analysis. </p>

<p>2.8. Problem formulation </p>

<p>The Random Forest algorithm is formally defined as a collection of 
tree-structured classifiers: f(x,θ k ),k=1,2,…,K; where θ k is a random vector 
that meets i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) assumption 
(Cover and Thomas, 2006) and each tree casts a unit vote for the most 
popular class at input x (Breiman, 2001). For classification problems, the 
forest prediction is the unweighted plurality of class votes (majority 
vote). The algorithm converges with a large enough number of trees. 
For more detailed explanation see Breiman (2001). </p>

<p>2.9. Parameter selection and classification </p>

<p>The R package 'caret' (Kuhn, 2012a) was used to implement recur-
sive feature elimination (RFE) based on the Gini-criterion with 5-fold 
cross-validation (CV) within the context of RF (Kuhn, 2012b). Each of 
the steps described below was performed for all modalities: cortical 
thickness, sulcal depth, Jacobian maps, non-cortical volumes, combined 
parcelled measurements of cortical thickness and non-cortical volumes. 
First, the measurements with near-zero variance were removed from 
the feature sets and the resulting output underwent stepwise RFE. 
10,000 trees were used to "grow" the first forest (using full feature 
set), and afterwards RFE was performed based on feature importance 
vector (defined in Eq. 1) derived from the first forest, by removing the 
lowest-ranked 5% of the features at each step (gradually reducing the 
dimensionality as 100%, 95%, … etc., up to 50%), and by the subsequent 
accuracy comparison with 5-fold CV. In order to reduce CPU, RAM and 
time usage the forests were trained with 1000 trees (instead of 10,000 
for the first forest) at each step of RFE. After selection of the optimal fea-
ture subset, m try -parameter adjustment was also performed using 1000 </p>

<p>), and 
finally the forests were retrained with optimal parameters using 
10,000 trees. For the parcelled data (non-cortical volumes and 
parcelled thickness), an exhaustive search for optimal feature subset 
and m try -parameter was performed, "growing" 1000 trees at each 
step with 10-fold CV. See diagram in Appendix Fig. A2. 
The following parameters from the final models were reported to 
characterize performance: out-of-bag error (for the term definition 
see Breiman, 2001), area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity/speci-
ficity and overall accuracy on the testing datasets of AD, HC and MCI 
subjects (see "Subsampling"). ROC-curves of the best models were com-
pared using DeLong3s test for two correlated ROCs, as implemented in 
the 'pROC' R-package (Robin et al., 2011). 
The robustness of each model was also tested with respect to cohort 
differences (using a different cohort of AD and HC subjects from the 
AddNeuroMed study) (Simmons et al., 2011). 
Finally, variables of importance were mapped from the best model 
into the brain space in order to identify the regions, which were most 
relevant for the classification. 
At every split node τ one of the m try variables, say x k , is used to 
form the split and there is a resulting decrease in the Gini index. 
The mean decrease of the Gini index, ▵i(τ) (Eq. 1) was used as a </p>

<p>where iðτÞ ¼ 1−∑ c∈C p </p>

<p>js R </p>

<p>j </p>

<p>j </p>

<p>js j j are the probabilities of sending a data point to the left and 
right nodes, respectively. 
This metric reflects the contribution of a variable x k to the node ho-
mogeneity of τ. Thus, a higher mean decrease (Eq. 1) of the Gini index 
for a particular feature means that the variable is present more often 
in nodes with higher purity among all trees in the forest (overall). The 
sum of all decreases in the forest due to a given variable x k , normalized 
by the number of trees, therefore gives an estimate of its Gini impor-
tance (Eq. 2), i.e.: </p>

<p>I G ðx k Þ ¼

<p>Therefore, the Gini importance I G ðx k Þ indicates how frequent the 
particular feature x k was selected in a split node, and how large its over-
all discriminative value was for the classification task. </p>

<p>2.10. Morphometric modality combination </p>

<p>The classifiers trained with individual morphometric modality 
were combined by a majority vote and subsequently compared 
with the best model that demonstrated the highest accuracy (the 
one trained using parcelled thickness and volumetric measure-
ments) on the test set. 
We were also interested in assessing the effects of feature selection. 
For this purpose, all the steps described above (in "Parameter selection 
and classification") were performed without RFE (only mtry-parameter 
adjustment). The resulting classifiers were assessed using the identical 
approach and combined together by a majority vote. </p>

<p>2.11. Use of different parcellation schemes </p>

<p>To investigate the effect of different atlases, we selected cortical 
thickness as a measurement type that produced the most accurate 
models and applied two parcellations implemented in the Freesurfer 
package -Desikan-Killiany (DK) and Destrieux (D) atlases -to extract 
averaged values from the predefined regions. 
DK (Desikan et al., 2006) is a gyral-based neuroanatomical 
parcellation atlas that subdivides each hemisphere of the human brain 
cortex into 34 regions. One of the important features of this atlas, 
which is especially relevant for the present study, is that it has been 
developed using MRI scans not only from healthy controls (young, 
middle-and old-age groups), but also from patients with AD, and there-
fore this parcellation may be considered as more disease-specific. In ad-
dition, the atlas includes the entorhinal cortex as a separate region. This 
area is a crucial element of the episodic memory system (Lipton and 
Eichenbaum, 2008) and known to be affected by Alzheimer3s disease 
from its initial stages (Braak and Braak, 1985). 
The D atlas (Fischl et al., 2004; Destrieux et al., 2010) utilizes proba-
bilistic labeling algorithm and among its advantages is that it is not tied 
to any specific neuroanatomical template, incorporating not only the 
probable location of a region of interest, but also the potential inter-
subject variance of the location of the region (Fischl et al., 2004). This 
parcellation includes more regions than the DK atlas (74 areas for 
each hemisphere versus 34 in the DK atlas). 
Next, after the training steps, we compared models3 performance 
and ROC-curves as described above. </p>

<p>2.12. Comparison with linear SVM </p>

<p>Apart from this, we compared our best models with "reference clas-
sifier", linear support vector machine (SVM) (Vapnik, 1995), tuned with 
recursive feature elimination. Of note, a non-linear SVM was not used as 
a reference, because it would be substantially more difficult and compu-
tationally expensive to tune and therefore would not be a fair compari-
son in terms of computation and memory costs. </p>

<p>2.13. Combining imaging biomarkers with ApoE genotype and demographics </p>

<p>The ɛ-4 allele of the gene encoding Apolipoprotein E is one of the 
major genetic risk factors for Alzheimer3s disease (Alonso Vilatela et al., 
2012). In order to investigate whether it was possible to further improve 
the best model (trained using combined cortical thickness and volumetric 
measurements) information on subjects3 ApoE genotype (together with 
demographics) was added as an additional feature. The resulting model 
was trained and assessed as described above. </p>

<p>3. Results </p>

<p>3.1. Demographics </p>

<p>The main demographic characteristics are described in Table 1. Signif-
icant differences between AD and HC subjects were observed in educa-
tion, in addition to word recall, ADAS-Cog and MMSE scores as expected. 
Corresponding description of the AddNeuroMed cohort is provided 
in Appendix Table A3. </p>

<p>3.2. Outlier detection </p>

<p>PCA-based outlier detection revealed one subject, whose Freesurfer 
output was corrupted and was therefore excluded from the subsequent 
analysis. </p>

<p>3.3. Classification </p>

<p>Time and memory costs of RFE and m try -adjustment varied substan-
tially depending on the number of features. Thus, the total tuning time 
varied between 10 min (volumetric data) and more than 89 h (Jacobian 
maps). For all steps, from 6 to 10 CPU cores were used, and RAM usage 
also varied significantly between 1 Gigabyte (GB) (volumetric data) 
and 58 GB (Jacobian maps). For details see Appendix Table. A4. 
Among all models, three had the best competing performances 
(Table 2, Fig. 1). The model trained using high-dimensional thickness 
measurements demonstrated AD-detection sensitivity/specificity of 
88.6%/90.7%, its out-of-bag AUC (95% C.I.) was 0.93 (0.9-0.96); while 
the model trained using volumetric measurements resulted in sensitivity/ 
specificity = 82.9%/86.7%, AUC = 0.91 (0.88-0.95); and using parcelled 
measurements of cortical thickness and subcortical structures resulted 
in sensitivity/specificity = 88.6%/92.0%, AUC = 0.94 (0.91-0.96). 
Comparing these 3 models with the corresponding ones without RFE 
revealed significant (p b 0.001) advantages of RFE only for the model 
trained with high-dimensional cortical thickness measurements. The 
difference between the remaining two models was not significant. </p>

<p>Comparison of the most accurate imaging-based RF model 
(trained using parcelled measures of cortical thickness and volu-
metric data) with a corresponding SVM classifier, revealed advan-
tages of the former. Test set AUC RF + RFE (95% C.I.) = 0.98 (0.96-1) and 
AUC SVM + RFE (95% C.I.) = 0.93 (0.87-0.98). Although there was a slight 
overlap between 95% C.I.s, further DeLong3s test revealed significant 
(p = 0.03) differences. </p>

<p>3.4. Combined models </p>

<p>Combining all models by a majority vote improved the overall accu-
racy (OA) to 91.0% (sensitivity/specificity = 88.6%/93.3% -test set). The 
ROC difference between the combined models with and without RFE 
was significant (p = 0.017). It did not, however, differ from the ROC of 
the best classifier trained using parcelled measurements of cortical 
thickness and non-cortical volumes (see Appendix Fig. A5). </p>

<p>3.5. Effects of different parcellation schemes on classifier performance </p>

<p>Use of the D parcellation atlas resulted in lower accuracy: test set 
sensitivity/specificity/OA = 74.3%/82.7%/78.5% (compared to 82.9%/ 
88.0%/85.4% for the DK atlas). ROC differences between parcellations 
[AUCs: 0.89 (0.85-0.93) and 0.90 (0.86-0.94), respectively] were non-
significant. Both models demonstrated lower performance compared to 
the one trained using non-parcelled measurements of cortical thickness 
(sensitivity/specificity/OA = 88.6%/90.7%/89.6%, AUC = 0.93(0.9 − 
0.96)). ROC differences (compared with "non-parcelled" models) were 
significant in both cases (p-values = 0.002 and 0.009, respectively). 
Test set accuracies were, however, equivalent for the DK and atlas-free 
measures. Results from this section are illustrated in Fig. 2. </p>

<p>3.6. Prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion </p>

<p>The best ability to predict MCI-to-AD conversion based on imaging 
data only was observed for the model in which all RF ensembles were 
combined by a majority vote, and was achieved at 76.6% in overall 
MCI-to-AD conversion detection sensitivity, 2 years before actual de-
mentia onset (averaged value for 6th-, 12th-, 18th-and 24th-month 
converters) with a specificity of 75.0% (see Table 3). </p>

<p>3.7. Combination with ApoE genotype and demographics </p>

<p>Adding ApoE genotype and demographics (age, sex, education) as 
additional predictors into our best AD/HC model, trained using com-
bined cortical thickness and non-cortical volumetric measurements, 
did not improve AD/HC classification accuracy (sensitivity/specificity/ 
OA = 90.7%/82.9%/86.7%). Meanwhile, its accuracy for MCI-to-AD con-
version was relatively higher compared to other models with maximum 
sensitivity/specificity/OA values of 83.3%/81.3%/82.3% (See Table 4). </p>

<p>However, this improvement was not significant with AUC for the 
averaged group of the 2-year converters of 0.83 (0.7-0.965) in the 
combined model versus AUC = 0.8(0.65 − 0.95) for cortical thickness 
alone (p = 0.74). </p>

<p>3.8. Robustness in different cohorts </p>

<p>Testing the ADNI models on AddNeuroMed data revealed good 
generalizability of the classifiers. The best stability (both for AD 
detection and prediction) was found for the models trained with 
high-dimensional measures of cortical thickness and parcelled 
thickness with volumetric measures. Combined models trained 
using both imaging and non-imaging data demonstrated absence 
of accuracy drop (see Table 5). </p>

<p>3.9. Regions of relevance </p>

<p>As expected, the observed pattern of feature relevance was typical for 
AD and similar in models trained using high-dimensional and parcelled 
input (Figs. 3 and 4). It included atrophy in temporal areas (with more ex-
tensive changes in the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala), 
lateral ventricular size differences and parietal cortical abnormalities. </p>

<p>4. Discussion </p>

<p>In the present study, we managed to produce robust and accurate 
models with good generalization across different cohorts. Our classifier 
ensembles demonstrated one of the best AD detection and prediction 
accuracy to date, superior over the reference model (linear SVM). It is 
also worth noting that performance of the best ADNI models on the 
AddNeuroMed dataset was equivalent to the cross-validated accuracies 
reported in Westman3s study (Westman et al., 2011). 
Of note, a recent study found no effect of the ApoE genotype on AD/ 
HC discrimination accuracy (Aguilar et al., 2013). This is in line with our 
results, which however demonstrated that adding this feature may be </p>

<p>beneficial for detecting earlier stages of the disease (MCI-to-AD 
converters). 
To the best of our knowledge, this study is also one of the first to in-
vestigate the impact of different parcellation schemes and dimensional-
ity of the imaging features on machine learning modeling accuracy, 
computation/memory and time costs. 
In our experiments, the use of a parcellation with more subregions 
(148 versus 68) resulted in a drop in accuracy, which can be explained 
by the fact that the Desikan-Killiany atlas provides more AD-specific 
segmentation of temporal lobes compared to the Destrieux scheme, 
extracting measurements from the entorhinal cortex (the cortical area 
first affected in AD). Therefore, the use of atlases providing segmentation 
of the regions primarily affected by the most common neurodegenerative 
diseases may be beneficial in such tasks. However, this is rather specu-
lative, since the atlases used in our study differ in many more aspects 
than just availability of the disease-specific regions. Measurement-
specific parcellation schemes may also be useful for further accuracy 
improvement. 
We did not find strong advantages for using high-dimensional input 
over parcelled measurements for our classification and prediction tasks. 
Both inputs produced models with equivalent performance. It is worth 
noting that tuning of the models with the parcelled input involved an 
exhaustive search for the optimal feature subset and m try -parameter, 
whereas tuning of the HD-models was carried out only partially. There-
fore, we cannot be sure that exhaustive tuning of the HD-models would 
not outperform the parcelled approach. But clarifying this currently 
does not appear to be feasible and practically relevant, even given abun-
dant computational and memory resources available for our study. Nev-
ertheless, it is worth mentioning that the use of high-dimensional raw 
features may have advantages for certain tasks due to the absence of 
spatial constraints of ROIs. Thus, we would generally expect this </p>

<p>approach to produce better performance when a disease-specific atlas is 
not available. 
In the present study, classifiers trained to differentiate between AD 
and HC demonstrated a good ability to predict MCI-to-AD conversion 
within 2 years before the onset of Alzheimer3s disease, which is in line 
with previous results (Westman et al., 2012). The best accuracy was 
observed for the classifier produced by the combination of all 
"high-dimensional" models with the model trained using non-cortical 
volumetric measurements. Superior accuracy of this classifier over the 
model trained using parcelled data can be explained by the ability to </p>

<p>detect less extensive structural changes, which are averaged in the 
atlas-based parcellation. 
Interestingly, a drop in the ability to predict MCI-to-AD conversion 
over 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36+ months was substantially steeper for cortical 
thickness and sulcal depth compared to Jacobian maps, which demon-
strated relatively stable performance over 2 years. It can be speculated 
that cortical thickness and sulcal depth are more dynamic measures, in-
dicating disease progression, while Jacobian maps, as a geometric fea-
ture associated with cortical folding patterns, may be more genetically 
determined and therefore more stable across lifespan. Thus, it has 
been shown that geometric measures are associated with the formation 
of neuronal connections and cortical connectivity patterns, serving as 
characteristics of cerebral development (Armstrong et al., 1995; Van 
Essen, 1997). However, further research is clearly needed to support 
or reject this speculation. 
Another interesting observation was that recursive feature elimina-
tion for the high-dimensional data improved performance of the model 
trained with cortical thickness, whereas other HD models did not seem 
to demonstrate substantial improvement. A possible explanation for 
this may be that the impact of neurodegeneration on cortical thickness 
is more localized to the entorhinal area, whereas its impact on sulcal 
depth and brain deformation is sparser, which complicates feature 
elimination. 
The main strengths of the present study are: </p>

<p>(a) the use of two large imaging databases of Alzheimer3s disease 
with assessment of the classifiers3 between-cohort robustness; 
(b) optimized models with one of the best accuracy to date; 
(c) evaluation of several important factors influencing classification 
performance, such as morphometric data modality and dimen-
sionality, parcellation schemes; 
(d) long-term follow-up available for the MCI subgroup from the 
ADNI cohort that allowed the appropriate definition of MCI 
non-converters and assessment of models3 sensitivity at different 
disease stages before the actual dementia onset. </p>

<p>It is also important to acknowledge several methodological limita-
tions, such as an influence of possible diagnostic mislabeling of the 
data on our results, and possible misdiagnosis, since autopsy data 
were not available. Therefore, without solving these issues one should 
not expect perfect diagnostic class separation. The first problem can 
be addressed post-hoc by using computational approaches to detect </p>

<p>Fig. 3. Cortical pattern of relevance for Alzheimer3s disease detection: high-dimensional morphometric data. The figure illustrates regions, which were the most relevant for Alzheimer3s 
disease detection based on the mean decrease of the Gini index (see Methods). In all three high-dimensional modalities, the pattern was AD-specific and included changes predominantly 
in temporal lobes (with maximum relevance of entorhinal region). </p>

<p>Fig. 4. Pattern of relevance for Alzheimer3s disease detection: parcelled morphometric data 
(cortical thickness [DK-atlas] + non-cortical volumes). The figure illustrates regions, which 
were the most relevant for Alzheimer3s disease detection based on the mean decrease of 
the Gini index. Likewise in the high-dimensional input, the pattern-of-relevance is AD-
specific. </p>

<p> 
A.V. Lebedev et al. / NeuroImage: Clinical 6 (2014) 115-125 </p>

<p>mislabeled examples, whereas the second problem is organizationally 
more complex and pertains to the imperfection of diagnostic criteria 
for AD, which can potentially be overcome by employing more diagnos-
tic procedures (for example, dopamine transporter imaging to exclude 
patients with Lewy body dementias), cerebrospinal fluid markers, and 
post-mortem diagnosis. 
Another important issue pertains to robustness of the classifiers to the 
MR-protocol differences. Clinical implementation of such models will still 
require additional reliability assessment in order to make sure that 
models3 between-cohort generalization is appropriate. Apart from this, 
traditional "offline" or "batch" learning framework (used in our study, 
where the whole training set is available to the algorithm at the begin-
ning) does not allow any modifications of the models after the training 
has been completed. The latter would be very relevant especially for the 
clinical setting where continuous data flow is usually available. The "on-
line" learning framework (where the system gradually "learns" using 
one instance at a time) may be beneficial in this context, providing not 
only an opportunity to update the models, but also valid estimations of 
the prediction confidence under a general i.i.d. assumption (independent 
and identically distributed) (Vovk, 2005; Gammerman and Vovk, 2007; 
Nouretdinov and Lebedev, 2013). Since this approach can be applied to 
an individual patient and gives reliable estimations of possible diagnoses, 
it has strong potential to be used in clinical practice and, to our opinion, 
would be the best candidate for diagnostic trials employing computer-
aided medical decision-support systems. 
To conclude, our workflow produces accurate models for detec-
tion and prediction of AD with good between-cohort robustness. 
The use of raw high-dimensional measurements does not appear to 
be effective due to its high computation/memory costs and at the 
same time equivalent performance compared to models trained 
with parcelled input. Therefore, we recommend using disease-
specific parcellation schemes for image classification tasks. Combi-
nation with other imaging and non-imaging biomarker modalities </p>

<p>may provide further improvement in accuracy and model 
robustness. </p>

dimensional measurements using Freesurfer software (blue box). After this part had completed, the extracted measures underwent steps for outlier detection, and the resulted output was 
used in further Random Forest classification runs (in R programming language -gray box). We additionally tuned our models using recursive feature elimination and m try -parameter 
adjustment (which defines the number of predictors randomly sampled at each node of the classifier). Finally, feature importance vectors from the best models were either mapped into 
the brain space (for the high-dimensional data) or plotted (for the parcelled input). </p>

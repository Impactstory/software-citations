<p>ABSTRACT 
Background: Cilostazol is an oral antiplatelet agent </p>

<p>currently indicated for treatment of intermittent 
claudication. There is evidence that cilostazol may 
reduce femoropopliteal restenosis after percutaneous 
endovascular intervention. </p>

<p>Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus and </p>

<p>Cochrane databases from 1966 through September 
2013 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating 
the addition of cilostazol to standard care in patients 
receiving femoropopliteal endovascular treatment. 
Restenosis, target lesion revascularisation and 
combined adverse outcomes (death, revascularisation 
and amputation) within 1-2 years postprocedure were 
evaluated. </p>

<p>Results: Of 205 articles, three RCTs were included in </p>

<p>the analysis. The pooled data provided a total of 396 
patients, 195 of whom received cilostazol. When 
compared to standard medical therapy alone, cilostazol 
significantly reduced the risk of restenosis (risk 
difference −0.20; 95% CI −0.29 to −0.11; p&lt;0.0001; 
number needed to treat 5), target lesion 
revascularisation (risk difference −0.17; 95% CI −0.25 
to −0.09; p&lt;0.0001; number needed to treat 6). Death 
and amputation were not different in between groups. </p>

<p>Conclusions and limitation: Cilostazol significantly </p>

<p>increases femoropopliteal patency and decreases 
adverse outcomes in percutaneous endovascular 
intervention. However, further RCTs are needed because 
of limited sample size; this meta-analysis represents the 
best current evidence. </p>

<p>Revascularisation is required for patients with

lines on the management of femoropopliteal 
PAD have expanded the indications for endo-
vascular therapy (EVT) to the detriment of 
surgical revascularisation. </p>

<p>The potential benefits of cilostazol after EVT

lines. Therefore, we decided to perform a

<p>KEY MESSAGES </p>

<p>What is already known about this subject? </p>

<p>▸ Cilostazol could decrease restenosis rates after 
endovascular therapy for peripheral artery 
disease, but the current randomised controlled 
trials evaluating this have small sample size. </p>

<p>What does this study add? </p>

<p>▸ We sought to improve the current level of evidence 
by conducting a systematic review and meta-
analysis of cilostazol and outcomes after endovas-
cular therapy for peripheral artery disease. We 
discovered that compared to standard medical 
therapy alone, cilostazol significantly reduced the 
risk of restenosis and target lesion revascularisa-
tion without any significant side effects. </p>

<p>How might this impact on clinical practice? </p>

<p>▸ Our study provides the best current evidence for 
using cilostazol after endovascular therapy in per-
ipheral artery disease as well as a rationale for a 
large, multicentre randomised controlled trial. </p>

<p>MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Search strategy 
We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus and 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for RCTs 
from 1966 to September 2013, which compared cilosta-
zol to standard medical therapy in patients with femoro-
popliteal EVT. The review was performed in accordance 
with established methods for systematic reviews in car-
diovascular medicine. 
11 The following medical subject 
heading terms were included for a MEDLINE search 
and adapted for other databases as needed: "cilostazol" 
AND ("peripheral arterial disease" OR "endovascular 
therapy" OR "femoropopliteal"). In addition to search-
ing databases, reference lists of all included studies, 
meta-analyses and reviews were manually searched, 
including unpublished data. There was neither language 
nor patient population size restriction for the search. </p>

<p>Data extraction 
Two authors independently completed data extraction 
after following defined search criteria and quality assess-
ment. They obtained data from tables, text and graphs. 
When the data were presented in percentage the absolute 
values were calculated. Disagreements were resolved by 
consensus after review by the senior author of the study. </p>

<p>Selection criteria 
Inclusion criteria were RCTs with (1) a direct compari-
son between patients treated with cilostazol and a 
control group who received standard medical therapy 
alone; (2) patients with femoropopliteal lesions due to 
PAD; (3) patients who received EVT; and (4) reports of 
the primary and secondary outcomes. Exclusion criteria 
were (1) studies that only reported outcomes of cilosta-
zol, without a direct comparison to a control group; (2) 
observational studies; (3) non-randomised clinical trials; 
and (4) overlapping patient population, identified by 
studies developed over the same period of time with 
common authors or common study centres. In this case, 
only the study with a greater number of patients was 
included. </p>

<p>Outcomes 
The primary outcome studied was 1-2-year incidence of 
restenosis after endovascular treatment defined by 
Doppler. Secondary outcomes of interest were 1-2-year 
target lesion revascularisation and combined major 
adverse outcomes, which included death, target lesion 
revascularisation, surgical revascularisation and amputa-
tions. When major combined outcomes were not pre-
sented as defined it was calculated adding the individual 
outcomes. </p>

tions of the Cochrane Collaboration and the Quality of

12 13 Pooled treat-
ment effects were estimated using risk difference (RD) 
with the Mantel-Haenszel method. We calculated the 
number needed to treat (NNT) according to the recom-
mendations 
of 
the 
Cochrane 
Collaboration. </p>

<p>Heterogeneity was assessed using χ

we defined I 
2 &lt;25% as low heterogeneity according to 
the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews. We per-
formed fixed effect analysis when I 
2 was less than 25% 
or p value at least 0.10; otherwise we used random 
effect. We assessed quality for each included trial accord-
ing to the methods of the Cochrane Collaboration. 
13 All 
included studies were controlled trials and were consid-
ered high quality. </p>

<p>RESULTS 
The process of study selection is shown in figure 1. 
Initial MEDLINE search using a systematic approach 
yielded 205 studies. The search in EMBASE and 
Cochrane registries did not yield additional studies. 
Through a review of titles and abstracts, 173 studies were 
rejected due to lack of relevance to our meta-analysis. 
The remaining 32 articles were reviewed and assessed 
for satisfaction of the inclusion or exclusion criteria. 
Three studies met all criteria and were included in this 
analysis. 
The first study 
14 had a follow-up period of 24 months 
and compared cilostazol/aspirin with ticlopidine/aspirin 
in 200 patients with femoropopliteal lesions. At 12 and 
24 months, the cilostazol/aspirin group reduced resten-
osis rates (18% vs 43% and 27% vs 52%, respectively). A 
smaller study in 2009 
15 also found similar results with 
restenosis rates (43% vs 70.3%). These findings were 
validated in a larger multicentre study in 2013 with 200 
patients 
16 that demonstrated an angiographic restenosis 
rate at 12 months of 20% in cilostazol group versus 49% 
in the non-cilostazol group. 
In order to obtain pooled estimates, a total of 396 
patients were included in this analysis. Following EVT 
for femoropopliteal PAD lesions, 195 individuals were 
treated with cilostazol and standard medical therapy, 
whereas 201 received standard medical therapy alone, 
which included aspirin and a thienopyridine. The main 
characteristics of individual studies can be found in 
table 1. Of note, stent restenosis by Doppler was defined 
as a peak systolic velocity ratio &gt;2.4 in Iida et al 
14 and 
Soga et al 
15 and &gt;2 in Iida et al. </p>

<p>Table 2 illustrates baseline characteristics of popula-
tions in the individual studies. All baseline variables 
including stenting ratio were similar in all studies with 
the exception of preprocedural Ankle Brachial Index 
(ABI) in Iida et al 
16 ; despite both groups having the ABI 
on the moderate disease range it was higher on the cilos-
tazol group (0.71 vs 0.66). 
For the primary outcome, as seen in figure 2, the 
follow-up revealed a significantly reduced incidence of 
restenosis in patients who received cilostazol in addition </p>

p&lt;0.0001; NNT 5). This was reflected on a reduced 
need for target lesion revascularisation (RD −0.17; 95% 
CI −0.25 to −0.09; p&lt;0.0001; NNT 6) with a NNT of 5 
for both outcomes (figure 3). We also conducted a sen-
sitivity analysis utilising OR as the primary pooled esti-
mate and the effect size did not change. Death and 
amputations did not statistically differ between the two 
groups. </p>

<p>DISCUSSION 
The potential benefit of cilostazol following EVT for 
femoropopliteal PAD was investigated in this study. Our 
meta-analysis of RCTs revealed that 75 of 201 patients 
not treated with cilostazol have developed restenosis 
within 12-24 months and that the chance of restenosis 
may be mitigated in more than 50% with cilostazol. This 
result is particularly significant when taken into account 
that cilostazol is a generic and inexpensive drug that has 
been shown to be a cost-effective drug in other clinical 
scenarios, such as treatment of intermittent claudication 
and secondary prevention of cerebral infarction 
9 10 and 
that the benefit is obtained with a small NNT. 
One-year incidence of restenosis after balloon angio-
plasty of femoropopliteal lesions has been reported as 
high as 64%. 
17 18 Sirolimus-eluting stents 
19-21 and endo-
vascular brachytherapy 
22 23 have failed to demonstrate a 
long-term decrease in the restenosis incidence following 
lower extremity EVT for PAD, but paclitaxel-eluting 
stents have shown increased patency and a lower rate of 
events. 
23 Nevertheless, patency has greatly improved 
since the introduction of nitinol stents. 
18 24 When com-
pared to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, the use 
of nitinol stenting decreased the 12-month restenosis </p>

<p>incidence from 81.3% to 36.7% in a RCT. </p>

<p>18 </p>

<p>Nevertheless, the results of this meta-analysis suggest 
that patency rates can be further increased with cilosta-
zol in addition to nitinol stents, given that stent use did 
not differ among cilostazol and control groups, as illu-
strated in table 2. 
Cilostazol has been shown to decrease restenosis and 
repeat revascularisation after percutaneous coronary 
intervention in patients with coronary artery disease, 
without an increased bleeding risk. 
25 Similarly, in this 
meta-analysis, target lesion revascularisation occurred in 
about every third patient on the control group over a 
12-24 month follow-up. The chance of requiring a 
repeat target lesion revascularisation was reduced in 
more than 60% with the use of cilostazol. The combined 
incidence of death, revascularisation and amputation 
was also significantly reduced in the cilostazol group 
but it was mostly driven by the reduced need for 
revascularisation. 
The main mechanism for cilostazol-mediated decrease 
in restenosis and target lesion revascularisation after EVT 
is likely inhibition of intimal hyperplasia. Cilostazol has 
been shown to suppress neointimal hyperplasia in animal 
models. 
26 27 Furthermore, RCTs have demonstrated that 
triple antiplatelet therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel and 
cilostazol was more effective than dual therapy alone in 
suppressing intimal hyperplasia. 
28 A second mechanism 
for improved outcomes in the cilostazol group is vasodila-
tion. Studies have shown that cilostazol increases walking 
distance in patients with PAD and improves ankle-brachial 
index due to vasodilation. 
29-31 Moreover, cilostazol med-
iates an in-vitro inhibition of smooth muscle cell prolifer-
ation. 
32 Whether this effect contributes to improved EVT 
procedural outcomes is unknown. Cilostazol also inhibits 
platelet aggregation. </p>

<p>Meta-analysis </p>

<p>This meta-analysis has some limitations. Owing to the 
limited number of studies the sample size is small. 
However, despite the limited sample size, our 
meta-analysis represents the best available evidence for 
the use of cilostazol to increase femoropopliteal patency 
after endovascular intervention. As with any meta-
analysis, our study is subject to publication bias that is 
potentially mitigated by the exclusive use of RCTs. 
Although the time frame of outcomes varied from 12 to 
24 months, most cases of restenosis following EVT for 
femoropopliteal lesions occurred from 6 to 12 months, </p>

able data are exclusively from Asian populations and it is 
possible that our results apply exclusively to Asian popu-
lations, but that is unlikely due to prior positive cilosta-
zol studies in other populations. Finally, regarding the 
antiplatelet properties of cilostazol, bleeding complica-
tions could not be assessed given that this outcome was 
not reported in all included studies and this could be 
considered to be an important limitation of our analysis. 
Only Soga's study attempted comparing major bleeding 
in dual versus triple therapy but no patients had events. 
Although not reported in these studies, there is robust 
evidence that when cilostazol is used in combination 
with dual antiplatelet therapy for other indications, 
there is no increased risk of bleeding compared to dual 
antiplatelet therapy alone. For example, in an RCT with 
patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing stent-
ing, triple therapy had similar bleeding events compared 
with dual antiplatelet therapy. </p>

<p>In summary, in our meta-analysis of RCTs, cilostazol 
following endovascular treatment for femoropopliteal 
PAD was shown to significantly reduce restenosis, target 
lesion revascularisation and combined adverse outcomes 
when compared to a standard therapy control group. 
Large RCTs are urged to confirm our findings. </p>

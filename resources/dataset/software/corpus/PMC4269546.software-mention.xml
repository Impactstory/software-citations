<p>To respond appropriately to objects, we must process visual inputs 
rapidly and assign them meaning. This involves highly dynamic, inter-
active neural processes through which information accumulates and 
cognitive operations are resolved across multiple time scales. 
However, there is currently no model of object recognition which pro-
vides an integrated account of how visual and semantic information 
emerge over time; therefore, it remains unknown how and when se-
mantic representations are evoked from visual inputs. Here, we test 
whether a model of individual objects-based on combining the HMax 
computational model of vision with semantic-feature information-can 
account for and predict time-varying neural activity recorded with mag-
netoencephalography. We show that combining HMax and semantic 
properties provides a better account of neural object representations 
compared with the HMax alone, both through model fit and classifica-
tion performance. Our results show that modeling and classifying indi-
vidual objects is significantly improved by adding semantic-feature 
information beyond ∼200 ms. These results provide important insights 
into the functional properties of visual processing across time. </p>

<p>Object representations in the ventral stream undergo a transi-
tion in the first half-second, becoming increasingly fine-
grained and specific (Sugase et al. 1999; Hochstein and Ahissar 
2002; Hegdé 2008; Mace et al. 2009; Clarke et al. 2013). This re-
quires highly dynamic and interactive brain mechanisms 
through which visual information accumulates and cognitive 
operations are rapidly resolved across multiple time scales, 
with a continuing interplay between visual and cognitive 
factors (Humphreys et al. 1988; Humphreys and Forde 2001). 
However, it is currently unclear when different forms of visual 
and semantic information emerge across time, and when visual 
signals contribute to semantic representations. Early models 
claimed that basic level (e.g., dog) information about objects is 
available prior to (superordinate) category information (Rosch 
et al. 1976; Jolicoeur et al. 1984); however, recent evidence has 
challenged this presupposition in favor of a coarse-to-fine 
model (Fei-Fei et al. 2007; Mace et al. 2009; Loschky and 
Larson 2010; Fabre-Thorpe 2011; Praß et al. 2013). This re-
search suggests that category information is present within the 
first-pass of neural propagations along the ventral stream 
(Kirchner and Thorpe 2006; Liu et al. 2009; Chan, Baker et al. 
2011), while object-specific, basic-level, semantic information 
emerges after 150-200 ms supported by recurrent interactions 
within the stream (Martinovic et al. 2008; Schendan and Maher 
2009; Clarke et al. 2011, 2013). Thus, information sufficient for 
categorical (e.g., "tool") and object-specific (e.g., "hammer") 
dissociations seem to be differentially represented over time. </p>

<p>In the current study, we ask what kind of model of object 
representations can account for such categorical and object-
specific semantic effects, by modeling both visual and seman-
tic properties of individual objects, and testing the efficacy of 
the model against time-sensitive neural activity using magne-
toencephalography (MEG). 
Several biologically plausible computational models have 
been developed based on hierarchical stages of the ventral pro-
cessing stream. The HMax model is a biologically inspired feed-
forward model of visual processing with different levels of the 
model being linked to different stages in the ventral visual 
pathway from V1 to posterior IT (Riesenhuber and Poggio 
1999), and matches human behavioral performance in a rapid 
visual categorization task (Serre et al. 2007). However, the 
extent to which the model can account for human neural object 
representations and whether object representations are better 
modeled by adding semantic information are both unknown. 
While there are well-developed computational models of 
human vision, models of object semantics-specifically those 
able to capture both category and object-specific conceptual 
information-are less well characterized at the neural level. 
Feature-based accounts of semantic representations can model 
both types of information (Farah and McClelland 1991; Hum-
phreys et al. 1995; Garrard et al. 2001; Tyler and Moss 2001; 
Cree and McRae 2003; Rogers and McClelland 2004; Vigliocco 
et al. 2004; Taylor et al. 2011) but have only been explicitly 
tested against neural activity in a few cases (e.g., Clarke et al. 
2013; Tyler et al. 2013). The semantic features from property 
norming studies (e.g., has ears, made of metal; McRae et al. 
2005; Devereux et al. 2013) provide a means of estimating se-
mantic content, capturing categorical structure as similar con-
cepts have similar features, while also differentiating between 
concepts as each concept has a unique set of features. Such se-
mantic content can be used as a proxy for the underlying 
neural representation of object meaning. 
Here, we test whether a visuo-semantic model-based on 
combining the HMax computational model of object recogni-
tion and semantic-feature information-can capture the time-
varying neural activity of individual objects. Multiple linear 
regressions are used to 1) ask how well our model fits MEG 
signals over time, and 2) test whether the mapping between the 
MEG signals and visual and semantic measures can predict MEG 
signals for novel items using a leave-two-out cross-validation ap-
proach (Fig. 1; Mitchell et al. 2008). Furthermore, we evaluate 
the performance of this model compared with models based 
only on HMax. The predictive accuracy of different combina-
tions of model parameters was used to reveal how specific 
forms of visual and semantic information are represented across 
time and source localization was used to reveal the neural 
regions primarily supporting these types of information. </p>

<p>Materials and Methods </p>

<p>Participants 
Fourteen participants (9 females, mean age 23.2 years) took part in the 
study. All gave informed consent and the study was approved by the 
Cambridge Psychology Research Ethics Committee. All were right-
handed and had normal, or corrected to normal vision. </p>

<p>Procedure and Stimuli 
Participants performed a basic-level naming task (e.g., "tiger") with 
302 objects from 11 categories (animals, buildings, clothing, food, fur-
niture, household items, musical instruments, plant life, tools, vehicles, 
weapons) that represented concepts from an anglicized version of a 
large property generation study (McRae et al. 2005; Taylor et al. 2012). 
All objects were presented in color as single objects on a white back-
ground. Each trial began with a black fixation cross on a white back-
ground for 500 ms before the object was shown for 500 ms, and 
followed by a blank screen lasting between 2400 and 2700 ms. The 
order of stimuli was pseudo-randomized such that consecutive stimuli 
were not phonologically related (i.e., shared an initial phoneme) and 
no more than 4 living or nonliving items could occur in a row. The 
stimuli were presented in 3 blocks. Stimuli were presented using 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">Eprime</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 2</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Psychology Software Tools</rs>, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) 
and object naming accuracy was recorded by the experimenter during 
data acquisition. </p>

<p>Stimulus Measures 
For each object, we obtained measures capturing the low and high-
level visual attributes of the picture in addition to feature-based seman-
tic measures. 
The low-and high-level visual information about objects was 
derived from the HMax computational model of vision downloaded 
from http://cbcl.mit.edu/software-datasets/standardmodel. Different 
levels of the model have been linked to different stages in the ventral 
visual pathway from V1 to posterior IT. Here, we extract responses 
from 2 levels of the HMax model to capture low and high-level visual 
object information: namely, the C1 responses relating to early visual 
cortex (V1/V2), and C2 responses relating to V4/posterior IT (Riesen-
huber and Poggio 1999; Serre et al. 2007). 
The input to the HMax model were gray-scale versions of the 
images seen during the MEG recording that were resized to 92 × 92 </p>

<p>pixels. Responses from different layers of the HMax model, the C1 and 
C2 responses, were extracted using the settings described by Serre et al. 
(2005) and precomputed S2 features from natural image fragments 
(downloaded http://cbcl.mit.edu/software-datasets/standardmodel). For 
each object, the responses at the 2 layers were extracted separately, and 
C1 and C2 matrices were constructed containing responses for all 302 
objects (C1 matrix dimensions 302 × 28608, C2 matrix dimensions 
302 × 2000). Principal components analyses were then performed on 
each matrix (using the <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> function princomp). The number of 
components used in the final model was determined based on 
maximum model classification performance for data in the time window 
100-300 ms using an independent group of participants performing 
the same task with similar objects (see Clarke et al. 2013). This proced-
ure identified that 12 HMaxC1 components and 6 HMaxC2 compo-
nents resulted in maximum classification accuracy and so these values 
were used in the final set of models (range tested: 1-12, 30, and 50 
components). 
The semantic content of objects was modeled using semantic-
feature norms (McRae et al. 2005; Taylor et al. 2012). The feature 
norms contain lists of features associated with a large range of objects 
(e.g., "has 4 legs," "has stripes," and "lives in Africa" are features of a 
"zebra"). As similar concepts have similar features, feature-based models 
capture categorical structure by virtue of feature overlap, while also cap-
turing the properties of a concept that differentiates it from other con-
cepts of the same semantic category, because each concept is composed 
of a unique set of features. Based on the feature norms, each object can 
be represented by a binary vector indicating whether each feature is as-
sociated with the object or not. The 302 objects used in this study were 
associated with 1510 features in total. Modeling semantic content was 
achieved using a binary concept-feature matrix derived from the prop-
erty norms. The matrix had dimensions of 302 concepts by 1510 
features, with cell values of 1 indicating which features are true for 
concepts and 0 in all other cells. A principal components analysis 
was used to reduce the dimensionality of this matrix, and the first 6 
semantic-feature components were selected based on maximum model 
classification performance for the time window 100-300 ms using an 
independent group of participants. </p>

<p>MEG/MRI Recording 
Continuous MEG data were recorded using a whole-head 306 channel 
(102 magnetometers, 204 planar gradiometers) Vector-view system 
(Elekta Neuromag, Helsinki, Finland) located at the MRC Cognition </p>

<p>Figure 1. Schematic of data analysis. Multiple linear regression was performed using MEG signals from each sensor and time point independently for the HMaxC1-only, HMax, and 
HMax + SemFeat sets of predictors. For the model fit analyses (top path), model fit (R </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>) was calculated for each predictor set for statistic comparison. For the classification 
analysis (bottom path), the regression coefficients from the multiple linear regression (based on all but 2 objects) were used to predict the MEG signals to the 2 left-out objects at 
each time point. The predicted data were constructed by applying the learned regression coefficients to the known visual and semantic parameters for the 2 left-out objects. The 
predicted patterns were classified as correct if they matched the observed patterns. The process is repeated for all possible leave-out object pairs, and accuracy is calculated as the 
proportion of pairs correctly classified at each time point. The classification accuracy time course for each predictor set are then compared. </p>

<p>and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge, UK. Participants were in a seated 
position. Eye movements and blinks were monitored with electro-
oculogram (EOG) electrodes placed around the eyes, and 5 head-
position indicator (HPI) coils were used to record the head position 
(every 200 ms) within the MEG helmet. The participants' head shape 
was digitally recorded using a 3D digitizer (Fastrak Polhemus, Inc., 
Colchester, VA, USA), along with the positions of the EOG electrodes, 
HPI coils, and fiducial points (nasion, left and right periaricular). MEG 
signals were recorded at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz, with a band-pass 
filter from 0.03 to 125 Hz. To facilitate source reconstruction, 1-mm </p>

<p>T 1 -weighted MPRAGE scans were acquired during a separate session 
with a Siemens 3 T Tim Trio scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Cam-
berley, UK) located at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, 
Cambridge, UK. </p>

<p>MEG Preprocessing 
Initial processing of the raw data used <rs id="software-2" type="software">MaxFilter</rs> <rs corresp="#software-2" type="version-number">version 2.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Elektra-Neuromag</rs>). First, static bad channels were detected that were subse-
quently reconstructed by interpolating neighboring channels, as were 
bad channels containing long periods of high amplitude or noisy 
signals. The temporal extension of the signal-space separation tech-
nique was applied to the data every 4 s to segregate the signals origin-
ating from within the participants' head from those generated by 
external sources of noise, along with head movement compensation 
and transformation of head position to a common head position. An 
artifact removal procedure was applied to the continuous data based 
on independent components analysis (ICA), implemented using 
EEGLab (Delorme and Makeig 2004). Components of the data that 
showed a correlation greater than a Pearson's r of 0.4 with either EOG 
channel were removed from the data. ICA was applied to the magnet-
ometers and gradiometers separately. 
The resulting MEG data were low-pass filtered at 40 Hz in forward 
and reverse directions using a fifth-order Butterworth digital filter, 
epoched from −200 to 600 ms, and downsampled to 100 Hz using 
<rs id="software-3" type="software">SPM</rs><rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">8</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Wellcome Institute of Imaging Neuroscience</rs>, London, UK). 
Items that were incorrectly named were excluded, where an incorrect 
name was defined as a response that did not match the correct 
concept. We did not explicitly account for potential muscle artifacts 
produced by the overt naming task as this should not affect our data 
considering the duration of the epoch examined and frequency range 
included in relation to the typical onset of muscle artifacts and their fre-
quency distribution (mean naming latency: 991 ms, standard deviation 
over participants: 109 ms). Furthermore, any such artifacts are unlikely 
to be confounded with visual or semantic processing in such a way to 
affect classification accuracy or model fit. </p>

<p>Model fit 
To determine how much variance in the MEG signals was captured by 
each of the 3 models, we calculated each model's R 
2 using multiple 
linear regression (no regularization) at each sensor and for each time 
point independently. We performed an item-wise analysis where the 
MEG activity to each object was averaged over participants, which also 
acted to increase signal-to-noise ratio. The 3 models tested contained 
different numbers of predictors-HMaxC1 predictors alone (n = 12), 
HMaxC1 and HMaxC2 predictors (n = 18), and HMax and semantic-
feature predictors (n = 24). Significant changes in model fit were calcu-
lated by the F-ratio of the change in R 
2 between models with different 
sets of predictors, and corrected for multiple comparisons over sensors 
and time using a false discovery rate (FDR) with an α of 0.05. </p>

<p>Concept Classification 
A leave-two-out cross validation approach was used to assess each 
model's ability to predict and classify individual concepts using mul-
tiple linear regressions (Fig. 1; Mitchell et al. 2008) where the predic-
tors of the regression model were composed of different combinations 
of C1, C2, and semantic measures. The data were split into a training 
set and the 2 left-out concepts. Multiple linear regression was per-
formed at each sensor and each time point independently, resulting in 
a spatiotemporal beta map of regression coefficients (weights) where </p>

<p>the betas capture the relationship between the observed MEG signals 
and a single predictor. The MEG signals for the 2 left-out concepts 
were then constructed through a weighted sum of the beta maps, 
where the weights are derived from the known C1, C2, and semantic 
values for those 2 concepts. The 2 predicted MEG patterns are then 
compared with the actual recorded signals, where correct classification 
is defined as higher Pearson's correlation between the correct 
predicted-observed pairs than the incorrect predicted-observed pair-
ings (Mitchell et al. 2008). Classification accuracy is determined for 
each time point between −200 and 600 ms, using a 30-ms sliding time 
window, creating a concept classification time course. The process was 
then repeated across all possible leave-out pairs (45 451) and for each 
model. 
Classification accuracy was computed for all 3 models (HMaxC1, 
HMaxC1 and HMaxC2, and HMax and semantic features). As there was 
some degree of correlation between the predictors (Supplementary 
Fig. 1), an additional analysis was conducted showing unique effects 
of semantic features. This was achieved by performing multiple linear 
regression on the MEG data using the HMax model parameters and ob-
taining the residuals. The classification analysis was then performed 
using the semantic-feature predictors and the residuals to show unique 
effects of semantic features that cannot be accounted for by the HMax 
model. 
As with model fit, concept classification was calculated with data 
where the MEG activity for an object was averaged across participants 
(except for a complementary analysis where classification was run for 
each participant independently; see Results). Classification accuracy 
was calculated for each leave-out pair, and an accuracy measure was 
calculated for each individual object as the mean accuracy over all 
leave-out pairs that contained the object. Overall classification accuracy 
for each model, as well as within-and between-category accuracies, 
was tested against chance (50%) at each time point using the Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test, which was also used to statistically compare classifica-
tion accuracy between pairs of models. Where classification accuracy 
was calculated for individual participants, two-tailed paired-sampled 
t-tests were used in place of Wilcoxon signed-rank test. All tests were 
corrected for multiple comparisons across time using FDR with an α of 
0.05. 
To compare the onset of significant between-and within-category 
classification accuracies, we created 10 000 bootstrapped samples by 
sampling with replacement. For classifications based on the group 
averaged data, the object pairs were sampled with replacement, and 
for classification statistics based on individual participant classifica-
tions, participants were sampled with replacement. For each bootstrap 
sample, we calculated the classification accuracy and determined the 
onset of above chance classification accuracy for between-and within-
category classification (defined as the first time after 50 ms that was 
significantly above chance). This allowed us to calculate bootstrap esti-
mates of the difference in onsets for between-and within-category clas-
sification accuracy, which were used to calculate the probability that 
between or within-category classification was significantly earlier than 
the other. </p>

<p>Source Localization: Visualizing Regression Coefficients 
To visualize the cortical representation of the regression weights, the 
minimum norm source localization technique was implemented in 
<rs id="software-4" type="software">SPM</rs><rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">8</rs> using the IID option. Instead of using the regression weights 
derived from MEG data averaged over participants (those used for 
model fit and classification), for source localization, we calculated the 
regression weights for each participant separately, that were then used 
as the inputs to the source localization procedure. These individual 
participant localizations were used to provide more accurate source re-
constructions than those that localizing the grand averaged data would 
have produced. Since the regression weights are obtained using linear 
equations with standardized predictors, they can be used for source lo-
calization (Hauk et al. 2006). MRI images were segmented and spatially 
normalized to an MNI template brain in Talairach space. A template 
cortical mesh with 8196 vertices was inverse normalized to the indivi-
dual's specific MRI space. MEG sensor locations were coregistered to 
MRI space using the fiducial and digitized head-points obtained during </p>

<p>3604 Predicting Individual Objects with MEG • Clarke et al. </p>

<p>acquisition. The forward model was created using the single shell 
option to calculate the lead-fields for the sources oriented normal to 
the cortical surface. The data from both magnetometers and gradi-
ometers were inverted together (Henson et al. 2009) to estimate activ-
ity at each cortical source using a minimum norm solution, where the 
inversion was performed simultaneously for all the regression weights 
for the epoch −200 to 600 ms. No depth weighting was applied. The 
estimated cortical activity was averaged across the specified time 
windows (70-160 and 200-400 ms-see Results) before generating an 
image in MNI space (absolute regression coefficient values), which 
was smoothed with a 6-mm FWHM Gaussian smoothing kernel. This 
produces a cortical representation of the regression weights for each 
predictor, which were then averaged across participants, and displayed 
on an inflated cortex using <rs id="software-5" type="software">Caret</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-5" type="url">http://www.nitrc.org/projects/caret</rs>/). 
The color scale used was defined by the maximum absolute regression 
coefficient over all time windows and conditions with no thresholds 
applied. </p>

<p>Source Localization: Regional Model fit 
To obtain regional measures of model fit, and test for changes in model 
fit when adding predictors, required estimating regional responses for 
single trials that could be entered into multiple linear regression 
models. This was achieved using a minimum norm source localization 
of the individual participant preprocessed MEG signals using the same 
parameters described above. After inversion, the time course for each 
single trial was extracted from 6 regions along the ventral stream 
before the trial data were averaged over participants. The locations of 
the regions were defined as the peaks from the localized regression 
coefficients after averaging over time windows and all predictors, and 
had a 10 mm radius. The MNI coordinates for the peak locations were 
in the occipital (left: −10, −94, −16, right: 22, −92, −14), inferior tem-
poral (left: −50, −52, −20, right: 52, −56, −16) and anterior temporal 
lobes (left: −30, −6, −40, right: 30, −4, −42). Each model's R 
2 was cal-
culated for 2 time windows (as above) and 6 regions separately using 
multiple linear regression between the mean source activity in the time 
window and the 3 models (HMaxC1, HMaxC1 and HMaxC2, and HMax 
and semantic features). Significant changes in model fit were calculated 
by the F-ratio of the change in R 
2 between models with different sets of 
predictors. </p>

<p>Results </p>

<p>Our initial analysis aimed to determine whether semantic in-
formation plays a significant role in object representations over 
and above that played by visual information. We tested this by 
evaluating the performance of a combined visuo-semantic 
model compared with a computational model of visual object 
recognition in accounting for neural representations over time. 
The evaluation was performed both in terms of overall mea-
sures of model fit, and each model's accuracy at predicting 
time-varying neural representations for individual objects. Fol-
lowing this, we tested if our semantic model can dissociate cat-
egorical and object-specific semantic processing. </p>

<p>Computational Visual and Semantic Models 
We tested 3 principal models with varying model parameters. 
The first model, "HMaxC1-only," reflects a model of early 
visual cortical responses and is based on the C1 layer of the 
HMax computational model of object recognition. The second 
model, "HMax," included both the C1 and C2 layers of the 
HMax model, and captures both low-and high-level visual 
object representations. Finally, HMax + SemFeat, represents a 
more complex visuo-semantic model and included the HMax 
parameters along with semantic-feature information. The se-
mantic information captures category information as similar 
concepts will have similar semantic features, while also </p>

<p>capturing object-specific semantic information as each concept 
is composed of a unique set of features. Therefore, we capture 
both category and object-specific semantic information in the 
same model. </p>

<p>Object Representations Require Semantic Information: 
Model fit &amp; Concept Classification 
We first determined how much variance in the MEG data was 
captured by each of the 3 models by calculating each model's 
R 
2 at each sensor and for each time point for the multiple 
linear regression models. This approach allows us to test how 
each model relates to the data across time, and importantly can 
show time-specific improvements in model fit. 
The maximum R 
2 for all models occurred between 50 and 
150 ms, while models including the C2 responses and 
semantic-feature information showed an increased fit follow-
ing this period (Fig. 2a). The HMax model (combining C1 and 
C2 layers) showed a significant improvement in model fit com-
pared with the HMaxC1-only model from 100 to 150 ms in pos-
terior sensors, followed by fewer effects primarily between 
290 and 450 ms (all qs &lt; 0.05, FDR corrected; Fig. 2b). Import-
antly, the model including semantic-feature information 
showed a significant and sustained increase in R 
2 compared 
with the HMax model from 200 to 580 ms with a focus over left 
anterior sensors (all qs &lt; 0.05, FDR corrected; Fig. 2c). As all 
models include the C1 responses, our results suggest that 
object representations are initially well modelled by low-level 
image properties before size and position invariant informa-
tion about object shape (captured in the C2 responses) begins 
to be processed from 100 ms. Finally, adding semantic infor-
mation into the model significantly increases model fit post 
200 ms showing that object-specific semantic information is 
processed after this time. These findings show that a model 
combining low-and high-level visual properties with semantic 
information provides a better model of the underlying neural 
representations than one based only on computational models 
of vision. 
A further test of the efficacy of each model is provided by 
the accuracy with which they can predict novel concepts. Pre-
diction accuracy was evaluated at each time point using a 
leave-two-out cross-validation approach. All 3 models could 
predict concepts significantly above chance (50%) from 50 ms 
lasting until 600 ms (all qs &lt; 0.05 FDR, Wilcoxon signed-rank 
tests), with an initial maximum in classification accuracy 
between 70 and 160 ms and a maximum 85% accuracy 
(HMaxC1-only: 83%, 110 ms; HMax: 85%, 120 ms; HMax + 
SemFeat: 84%, 110 ms; Fig. 3). All models showed a second 
sustained increase in classification performance between 200 
and 400 ms, during which the model including semantic infor-
mation showed an increase in performance compared with 
both HMax models (maximum accuracy: HMaxC1-only: 73%, 
290 ms; HMax: 74%, 290 ms; HMax + SemFeat: 77%, 290 ms). 
A statistical comparison of classification performance over 
time showed the model including semantic information was 
significantly better able to predict concepts than both the 
HMaxC1-only and HMax models between 190 and 600 ms (all 
qs &lt; 0.05 FDR, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests). To rule out the 
possibility that the increased classification performance for the 
HMax + SemFeat model was driven by having a greater 
number of predictors in the model (number of predictors: 
HMaxC1-only 12, HMax 18, HMax + SemFeat 24), we ran an </p>

<p>Cerebral Cortex October 2015, V 25 N 10 3605 </p>

<p>additional control analysis where all models had an equal 
number of predictors [i.e., 12 extra predictors were added to 
the HMaxC1-only model, and 6 extra were added to the HMax 
model (3 from C1 and 3 from C2)]. The results replicated those 
of the original analyses (Supplementary Fig. 2) and further 
support the claim that the added semantic information repre-
sents a qualitative, rather than quantitative, improvement to 
modeling neural activity. Together with the model fit results, 
our findings suggest that object-specific semantic information 
is present after approximately 200 ms, and that a model includ-
ing semantic-feature information provided the best description 
of the underlying neural representations. </p>

<p>Categorical versus Object-specific Semantic 
Representations 
The analysis up to this point has concentrated on modeling the 
representations of individual objects, rather than categorical </p>

<p>representations. To test the models' ability to account for cat-
egorical and object-specific semantic representations, we can 
break down the predictive accuracy of the semantic-feature 
model when the 2 left-out items are from different categories 
(between-category, e.g., when one item is an animal and the 
other a tool) or the same category (within-category, e.g., when 
both items are animals, or both items are tools). Partitioning 
classification accuracies in this manner gives us information 
about whether the semantic-feature model can successfully 
perform both categorical (between-category) and fine-grained 
(within-category) distinctions between objects. 
Using the full HMax + SemFeat model, both between-and 
within-category classifications were significantly better than 
chance after 50 ms (all qs &lt; 0.05 FDR, Wilcoxon signed-rank 
test). Comparing the latency of the onsets for between-and 
within-category classification using bootstrapping showed no 
significant difference in latency (P = 0.96). While early classifi-
cation accuracies were similar overall, after 120 ms accuracy </p>

<p>was significantly higher for between-category distinctions 
(maximum 79%) than within-category distinctions (72%) (all 
qs &lt; 0.05 FDR, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests; Fig. 4a). As both 
within-and between-category predictions were successful 
from 50 ms, the full model (HMax + SemFeat) does not dissoci-
ate the timing of categorical and object-specific semantic dis-
tinctions. This may be because both types of information are 
rapidly accessed, or due to the HMax parameters supporting a 
high degree of classification in early time periods; showing 
that fine-grained low-and high-level visual information is 
present and able to dissociate any 2 images (regardless of cat-
egory). If the latter case is true, this may mask any differences 
between categorical and fine-grained classification accuracy 
that is only driven by semantic information. Therefore, we 
evaluated the HMax and SemFeat components of the model in-
dependently. As there is some degree of correlation between 
the predictors for the HMax and SemFeat models (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1), the classification analysis was performed based on 
the HMax model first, before being performed using the 
SemFeat model after removing any variance in the MEG signals 
that correlated with the HMax model. This was achieved by 
first running multiple linear regressions against the MEG 
signals with the HMax model predictors to obtain the residuals, 
which were then used in the classification analysis based on 
the SemFeat model predictors. This allows us to determine if </p>

<p>the SemFeat model can still classify between-and within-
category objects, even when all the variance that can be 
accounted for by the HMax model has been removed. 
Using the HMax model, both within and between-category 
distinctions were significant from 50 ms (all qs &lt; 0.05 FDR, 
Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and the onsets for between-and 
within-category effects were not significantly different (P = 
0.98). Again classification accuracies were similar for the initial 
peak, before accuracy was significantly higher for between-
category distinctions than within-category distinctions from 
150 ms to the end of the analysis window (all qs &lt; 0.05 FDR, 
Wilcoxon signed-rank tests; Fig. 4b). For the SemFeat model, 
between-category classification was significantly better than 
chance after 110 ms with an initial maximum at 130 ms (q &lt; 
0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, FDR corrected; maximum 
59%; Fig. 4c) while within-category classification only became 
significant at later time points from 150 to 250 ms, reaching a 
maximum at 230 ms (all qs &lt; 0.05 FDR, Wilcoxon signed-rank 
test; maximum 59%). Furthermore, within-category classifica-
tions were significantly better than chance between 330 and 
360 ms and again from 400 to 500 ms. Bootstrapping revealed 
that the onset of successful between-category classification 
was reliably earlier than successful within-category classifica-
tion (P = 0.027). Direct comparisons of between-and within-
category accuracies showed that between-category accuracy 
was significantly higher than within-category accuracy 
between 120 and 140 ms, and from 200 ms to the end of the 
analysis window (all qs &lt; 0.05 FDR, Wilcoxon signed-rank 
tests). These analyses indicate that the semantic information 
reflected in the MEG signals is able to dissociate between 
members of different categories significantly earlier than disso-
ciations can occur within a category. </p>

<p>Concept Classification: Single-participant Models 
The above classification analyses assessed the ability to con-
struct and classify concepts using a model trained and tested 
on MEG responses averaged over participants. Here we ask 
whether these effects are conserved when training and testing 
the models on single-trial data from individual participants. 
To test between the 3 models, classification accuracy was 
tested in 2 time windows for each participant -from 70 to 160 
ms where we saw strong effects of the visual model, and from 
200 to 400 ms where the semantic-feature information led to a 
significantly better model of the data. Within these 2 time 
windows, we predicted/classified the MEG signals for the 
left-out objects based on the spatiotemporal response patterns </p>

<p>across all sensors and all time points within the time window. 
In both time windows, all participants performed better than 
chance, ranging between 54 and 83% (Fig. 5a,b). In the first 
time window, the HMaxC1 model had the highest overall ac-
curacy (HMaxC1 mean: 72.1%, HMax mean: 71.7%, HMaxSem-
feat mean: 70.2%) and was significantly higher than the 
HMaxSemfeat model (t (13) = 2.76, P = 0.016). There were no 
significant differences between the HMax model and either the 
HMaxC1 (t (13) = 0.39, P = 0.70) or HMaxSemfeat models 
(t (13) = 1.35, P = 0.20). In the 200-400 ms time window, the 
HMaxSemfeat model had the highest overall accuracy 
(HMaxC1 mean: 63.2%, HMax mean: 63.0%, HMaxSemfeat 
mean: 64.9%) and was significantly higher than both the HMax 
(t (13) = 8.76, P &lt; 0.0001) and HMaxC1 models (t (13) = 3.81, P = 
0.002). There was no significant difference between the HMax 
and HMaxC1 models (t (13) = 0.52, P = 0.66). </p>

<p>Between-and within-category classification time courses 
were also calculated for each participant based on the SemFeat 
model (after removing effects of the HMax model). This re-
vealed that between-category effects are significantly better 
than chance from 120 to 600 ms (all qs &lt; 0.05, FDR), and that 
within-category classifications are significantly better than 
chance from 210 to 350 ms, and from 410 to 460 ms (all qs &lt; 
0.05, FDR). Furthermore, between-category classifications are 
significantly better than within-category classifications 
between 120 and 140 ms, and from 180 to 600 ms (all qs &lt; 
0.05, FDR). Finally, bootstrapping showed the onset of signifi-
cant between-category classification was prior to the onset of 
within-category classifications (P = 0.013). These results show 
that the pattern of results described above is also apparent at 
the individual participant level, and that our effects cannot be 
explained by a minority of the participants driving the effects 
in the averaged MEG data. </p>

<p>Source Localisation of Regression Weights and Regional 
Model fit 
The analyses so far highlight that early object representations 
-principally between 70 and 160 ms-can be modeled with 
the low-and higher level visual object properties of the HMax 
model. Furthermore, within this timeframe, we also find evi-
dence for the processing of semantic information that can dis-
sociate between members of different object categories prior 
to more specific conceptual representations largely between 
150-200 and 400 ms. To visualize the neural regions that are 
most important to object-specific classification, we mapped the 
regression weights of each model predictor to the cortical 
surface. To achieve this, source localization was performed for 
each predictor's regression weights that were calculated for the 
MEG sensors (Hauk et al. 2006). The absolute cortical regres-
sion weights for each type of predictor were averaged to create 
single maps for HMaxC1, HMaxC2, and semantic information. 
We found the strongest weights associated with HMaxC1 re-
sponses from 70 to 160 ms in early visual cortex, highlighting 
this variable's relationship to low-level visual processing of 
objects (Fig. 6). The HMaxC2 response weights were overall 
weaker but with peaks in the posterior inferior temporal (IT) 
cortex, while the semantic-feature weights had maximal re-
gression weights in posterior IT and the anterior temporal 
lobe. During the later time window from 200 to 400 ms, the 
strongest regression weights for semantic features were 
focused in bilateral IT and the anterior temporal lobes. Further-
more, regression weights for the HMaxC2 predictors were 
maximal in the right IT while HMaxC1 weights were overall 
reduced compared with the early time window. 
Finally, we tested to what extent the 3 different models 
could account for regional responses along the ventral stream 
and at which times and locations adding different predictors 
resulted in an improved model fit (Fig. 7). We found that in the 
time window 70-160 ms, adding the HMaxC2 responses to 
HMaxC1 model led to a significantly better fit to the data in bi-
lateral occipital (left: F = 3.03, P = 0.0068, right: F = 5.41, P = 0. 
0.00003) and right IT (F = 2.15, P = 0.048). During the later 
time window, 200-400 ms, adding semantic-feature informa-
tion into the model led to a significant improvement in model 
fit in the bilateral anterior temporal lobe (left: F = 3.12, P = 
0.0057, right: F = 2.18, P = 0.045), left IT (F = 2.31, P = 0.034) 
and the right occipital lobe (F = 5.25, P = 0.000038). Together, </p>

<p>the localization of the regression weights and regional model 
fit analysis indicate that HMaxC1 effects are primarily driven by 
early visual regions while HMaxC2 responses are additionally 
reflected in the posterior occipital lobe and IT. Finally, the 
object-specific semantic information captured with the SemFeat 
predictors was encoded in IT and the anterior temporal lobes. </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>The current study aimed to characterize when different forms 
of visual and semantic information emerge over time. To 
address these issues, we tested the efficacy of a visuo-semantic 
model based on a computational model of vision and semantic-
feature statistics by evaluating its ability to model and predict 
time-varying neural activity patterns associated with individual 
objects. 
This study provides clear evidence that semantic informa-
tion plays a key role during the temporal formation of object 
representations. The model including semantic-feature infor-
mation outperformed the HMax computational model of 
vision in terms of classification accuracy and in the model fit to 
the data after 200 ms. This shows that a model of meaningful 
object representations based on combinations of visual and 
semantic-feature-based measures provides a better account 
of underlying object representations than one based on </p>

<p>computational models of vision alone. Furthermore, this sug-
gests that models based just on visual information do not suffi-
ciently model meaningful object representations beyond the 
first ∼150 ms. This may be expected given the HMax model is 
only claimed to capture immediate vision based on feed-
forward processing alone (Serre et al. 2005, 2007). The HMax 
model does not reflect any form of more abstract object infor-
mation not directly related to the visual input, one class of 
which is semantic information that is required to fully model 
object representations. This is not to suggest that the feature 
representations used in our semantic model (e.g., "has legs," 
"made of metal") are literally coded in neural populations, but 
that the statistical regularities observed across features share 
some properties with the regularities observed in neural 
semantic object representations. 
The timing of these semantic-feature effects, post 200 ms, 
provides evidence that the concept-level individuation of spe-
cific objects is not accomplished through an initial feedforward 
propagation of signals thought to be completed within 100-
150 ms, suggesting it relies on more dynamic recurrent pro-
cessing. This interpretation is supported by other MEG/EEG 
studies showing that fine-grained object-specific semantic in-
formation emerges beyond 150-200 ms, after which long-
range recurrent processes are engaged (involving prefrontal 
cortex, anterior temporal, and posterior temporal regions) that 
function to disambiguate the object, enabling semantic indi-
viduation and the formation of concept-specific representa-
tions (Bar et al. 2006; Schendan and Maher 2009; Clarke et al. 
2011, 2013; Scholl et al. 2014). 
The effects driven by semantic-feature information were 
significant in the anterior temporal lobes, posterior IT, and the </p>

<p>right occipital lobe. Aspects of the anterior temporal lobe are 
considered key to representing conceptual representations 
(Tyler et al. 2004, 2013; Moss et al. 2005; Patterson et al. 2007; 
Lambon Ralph et al. 2010; Mion et al. 2010; Clarke and Tyler 
2014), which is also consistent with intracranial recording data 
from the human medial temporal lobes showing modality in-
variant responses to individual concepts from around 300 ms 
(Quian Quiroga et al. 2007, 2009). However, we believe it is 
unlikely that individual conceptual representations only rely 
on the anterior temporal lobes, as shown by the localization of 
the semantic-feature regression coefficients in IT and the 
region's improved model fit when adding semantic informa-
tion. Therefore, the anterior temporal lobes may function in 
cooperation with more posterior temporal regions and is con-
cordant with previous research which shows that interactions 
between the anterior temporal lobe and the posterior fusiform 
are crucial for processing fine-grained information about 
objects (Clarke et al. 2011). This is further supported by evi-
dence showing that, when the anterior temporal lobes are 
damaged, there is decreased functional activation in the poster-
ior ventral stream during semantic tasks (Mummery et al. 
1999) and reduced feedback from anterior to posterior ventral 
stream regions (Campo et al. 2013). One hypothesis of the pu-
tative function of this interaction is the integration of semantic 
information coded in the posterior temporal lobes, which is 
driven by conjunctive neurons in the perirhinal cortex that act 
to bind together complex object information (Miyashita et al. 
1996; Moss et al. 2005; Taylor et al. 2006; Mion et al. 2010; 
Chan, Baker et al. 2011; Clarke et al. 2011; Tyler et al. 2013; 
Clarke and Tyler 2014). 
This is not to suggest that semantic information is only re-
presented beyond ∼200 ms. We also found evidence that early 
semantic processing can underpin the dissociation of objects 
from different categories, and was observed significantly 
earlier than semantic information than can dissociate between 
members of the same category. This was based on a model in-
cluding only semantic-feature information, and after any 
effects accounted for by the HMax model had been removed, 
and so directly reveals when there is sufficient semantic infor-
mation captured in MEG data to make different kinds of object 
dissociations. The purely semantic-feature model showed sig-
nificant between-category classification after 110 ms (initial 
maximum was 130 ms) and significant within-category classifi-
cation from 160 ms (maximum at 210 ms; note the onset 
latency of within-category effects was 210 ms using the single-
participant classifications though both analysis show similar 
time courses and peaks). 
While between-category classification accuracy became stat-
istically significant after 110 ms, the maximum accuracy overall 
was observed after 350 ms and later than the maximum for 
within-category classifications (230 ms). The within-category 
classification effects we observed were not sustained through-
out the epoch, showing intermittent above chance effects. One 
reason why the significant within-category classifications may 
not be sustained after the onset could be that our analysis 
focuses on the aspects of the MEG signal that are time-locked 
to the onset of the image (the evoked signals). The initial 
between-category and within-category classification effects 
will be largely underpinned by the evoked information in the 
MEG signals. However, if there is information relevant to 
within-category classifications in the MEG signals that is jit-
tered in time across trials, then our approach will not fully </p>

<p>utilize this information, and as a consequence may underper-
form. Future research into the contribution of evoked and 
induced frequency-specific oscillations, and the functional 
relevance of these time windows will be required to fully 
understand the encoding of specific visual and semantic para-
meters and how they support behavior. 
Despite this, we do not take the sustained between-category 
effects and intermittent within-category effects to reflect the 
later processing of category information compared with object-
specific semantic information, but rather we focus on when 
there is sufficient information to make between-and within-
category distinctions. The early significant category distinc-
tions, after 110 ms, show a similar latency to previously re-
ported categorical distinctions in the ventral stream (Liu et al. 
2009; Chan, Baker et al. 2011). The latency and duration of the 
significant within-category distinctions (150-250 ms) is con-
sistent with research showing increased activity in the ventral 
stream from 170 to 258 ms for object-specific semantic infor-
mation compared with general category information (Clarke 
et al. 2011), and that after ∼200 ms neural activity begins to 
correlate with naming latencies (Costa et al. 2009). 
This suggests that in addition to processing visual aspects of 
the image, more abstract semantic information is also pro-
cessed within the initial feedforward processing, providing a 
sufficient level of representational detail to support coarse se-
mantic decisions prior to the formation of specific conceptual 
representations. These results are in contrast to claims that 
basic-level conceptual information is available prior to super-
ordinate category information (Rosch et al. 1976; Jolicoeur 
et al. 1984), instead supporting a model of object recognition 
where the initial feedforward responses support coarse, cat-
egorical knowledge about objects (Kirchner and Thorpe 2006; 
Liu et al. 2009; Chan, Baker et al. 2011), while the information 
required for individual semantic concepts emerges subse-
quently and depends on recurrent interactions (Schendan and 
Maher 2009; Clarke et al. 2011, 2013) and the continued inter-
play between visual and semantic factors (Humphreys et al. 
1988; Humphreys and Forde 2001). This progression of seman-
tic information over time does not necessarily suggest discrete 
stages of initial category representations and later concept-
specific representations, but instead can be formulated in 
terms of information emerging and accumulating over time, 
where different kinds of decisions can be made at different la-
tencies based on the information available in current represen-
tations (Mack and Palmeri 2011). 
In this study, we used machine learning techniques to gen-
erate neural predictions for the representation of objects. By 
training a model which incorporated both visual and semantic 
measures, we were able to successfully construct neural repre-
sentations for untrained objects with a high degree of accuracy. 
As the predicted neural representations were novel concepts, 
this approach allows us to generalize and construct spatio-
temporal neural activations for a potentially limitless set of 
meaningful objects. However, it is worth noting that some of 
our analyses are based on MEG signals averaged over partici-
pants, and so future analyses can be used to determine to what 
extent the models fully generalize across participants. Visual 
object classification studies utilizing time-sensitive methods, 
such as EEG, intracranial recordings and MEG have successfully 
shown that different categories of object and word can be clas-
sified very rapidly (Liu et al. 2009; Simanova et al. 2010; Chan, 
Halgren et al. 2011; Murphy et al. 2011). For example, EEG </p>

<p>3610 Predicting Individual Objects with MEG • Clarke et al. </p>

<p>patterns can successfully predict whether an object is an animal 
or a tool within 200 ms (Simanova et al. 2010), although it is 
unclear if the basis of classification success is visual or semantic 
(or both). The regression approach used here is based on specif-
ic, theoretically motivated predictors, and the relevance of these 
predictors governs whether classification accuracy improves or 
fails. This is in contrast to many decoding classification ap-
proaches that seek to find differences between 2 (or more) 
classes of stimuli, but which do not reveal the underlying basis 
of that difference (Kriegeskorte 2011; Naselaris et al. 2011). 
Therefore, the classification approach we have adopted pro-
vides important information about the basis on which classifica-
tion works (also see Sudre et al. 2012 for a related approach). 
Understanding how visual objects are represented in the 
brain is one of the central questions in neuroscience, but has 
traditionally been tackled using methods insensitive to the 
time-varying neural dynamics. Here, we utilized time-sensitive 
MEG recordings to model the visual and semantic representa-
tions of individual objects. Object representations are com-
posed of complex visual and semantic information, both of 
which are necessary to comprehensively model the processing 
of such representations. We demonstrate that a visuo-semantic 
model that includes low and high-level visual properties to-
gether with semantic-feature information provides an effective 
model of the time-varying neural representations of individual 
objects. Our results are supported by measures of model fit as 
well as predictive performance in constructing and classifying 
individual objects, and clearly highlight the need to incorpor-
ate complex semantic information about objects to understand 
how objects are represented and processed in the brain. </p>

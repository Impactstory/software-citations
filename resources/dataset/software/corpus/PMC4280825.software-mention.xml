<p>It was reported 25 years ago that intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) 
injection of angiotensin IV (Ang IV, Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe), an 
angiotensin II metabolite, improved memory and learning in 
rats. 
[1] The positive impact of Ang IV on cognition was subse-
quently confirmed in a series of animal models in both rats 
and mice. 
[2-5] Structurally related analogues to Ang IV, such as 
the endogenous LVV-hemorphin-7 (Leu-Val-Val-Tyr-Pro-Trp-Thr-
Glu-Arg-Phe), in which a tyrosine residue is attached to lipo-
philic amino acid residues, as in Ang IV, exhibited similar out-
comes. 
[6] These abilities to improve processes related to </p>

<p>memory and learning have attracted considerable interest in 
recent years. </p>

<p>[7, 8] </p>

<p>A specific binding site for Ang IV was identified in 1992, </p>

<p>[9, 10] </p>

<p>and high densities of the binding sites were found in areas of 
the brain that are associated with cognitive, sensory, and 
motor functions, including the hippocampus. 
[9] Insulin-regulat-
ed aminopeptidase (IRAP), a high-affinity receptor for Ang IV, 
was purified in 2001. 
[11] IRAP has been identified as cystinyl 
aminopeptidase (CAP, EC 3.4.11.3), placental leucine aminopep-
tidase (P-LAP, soluble human homologue), oxytocinase, gp160, 
or vp165. 
[12-14] IRAP, a single-spanning transmembrane zinc-
metallopeptidase that belongs to the M1 family of aminopep-
tidases, 
[15] has attracted awareness as a potential target for 
pharmaceuticals aimed at the treatment of cognitive disor-
ders. 
[8, 16-18] It is hypothesized that the inhibition of the catalytic 
activity of IRAP by the hexapeptide Ang IV results in longer 
half-lives of endogenous substrates to IRAP, such as vasopres-
sin and oxytocin, which are macrocyclic disulfides and are 
known to exert favorable influences on cognitive parameters 
in the brain, 
[19 ] although several alternative and relevant hy-
potheses explaining the action of Ang IV have been pro-
posed. </p>

<p>[20, 21] </p>

<p>We recently reported the syntheses and IRAP inhibition data 
from a series of constrained macrocycles derived from Ang IV 
and with structural similarities to, for example, oxytocin in the 
N terminus. 
[22-24] Among those, HA-08 (1), which has a b3hTyr 
residue in a 13-membered macrocyclic system is 20 times 
more potent than Ang IV as an IRAP inhibitor. 
[24] Although fur-
ther optimization and application of the metathesis reaction 
delivered very potent and more metabolically stable macrocy-
clic carba analogues, 
[22] these inhibitors, designed from struc-
tures of cyclic substrates, are still too peptidic and not likely to 
be able to enter the brain. </p>

<p>The inhibition of insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP, EC 
3.4.11.3) by angiotenesin IV is known to improve memory and 
learning in rats. Screening 10 500 low-molecular-weight com-
pounds in an enzyme inhibition assay with IRAP from Chinese 
Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells provided an arylsulfonamide (N-(3-
(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenyl)-4-bromo-5-chlorothiophene-2-sulfona-
mide), comprising a tetrazole in the meta position of the aro-
matic ring, as a hit. Analogues of this hit were synthesized, and </p>

<p>their inhibitory capacities were determined. A small structure-
activity relationship study revealed that the sulfonamide func-
tion and the tetrazole ring are crucial for IRAP inhibition. The 
inhibitors exhibited a moderate inhibitory potency with an 
IC 50 = 1.1 AE 0.5 mm for the best inhibitor in the series. Further 
optimization of this new class of IRAP inhibitors is required to 
make them attractive as research tools and as potential cogni-
tive enhancers. </p>

<p>Recently, Albiston et al. discovered a series of drug-like IRAP 
inhibitors encompassing a benzopyran system. 
[7, 25, 26] These in-
hibitors were identified after in silico screening of 1.5 million 
commercially available compounds against an IRAP model 
structure. After i.c.v. administration of one of these inhibitors, 
HFI-419 (2), a pronounced enhancement of memory in two 
memory paradigms in rat was observed. We were encouraged 
by these findings and performed a screening campaign of a li-
brary of 10 500 low-molecular-weight compounds and mea-
sured the inhibition of the catalytic activity of IRAP from Chi-
nese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. After subsequent hit confirma-
tion experiments, we identified sulfonamide 3 as one of the 
most promising compounds. We herein report the syntheses 
of a series of analogues of 3, their inhibitory capacity, and 
structure-activity relationships of this new class of IRAP inhibi-
tors. </p>

<p>Results and Discussion </p>

<p>In the primary high-throughput screen (HTS), analogues of 3, 
with a carboxylate group rather than the bioisosteric tetrazole 
in the ortho, meta, or para positions of the aromatic ring, were 
all found to be devoid of capacity to inhibit or be very weak 
inhibitors of IRAP, suggesting that an acidic function is not 
a sufficient criterion to achieve inhibition. Hence, the IC 50 
values for the meta carboxylate and the corresponding ethyl 
ester were determined to be greater than 125 mm in the hit 
confirmation experiments. Furthermore, the regioisomer of 3, 
with the tetrazole ring positioned in the para position rather 
than in the meta position, was inactive according to the pre-
liminary data. 
To examine the basic structure-activity relationships, com-
pounds 3, 7-22, 25, and 27 were synthesized and evaluated as 
inhibitors in an IRAP enzyme assay with a special emphasis to 
assess whether the thiophene ring, sulfonamide function, and 
the acidic NH of the tetrazole are prerequisites for binding to 
IRAP. 
The target compounds 3, 7-22, 25, and 27 were synthesized 
as shown in Schemes 1-3. Compound 3, 7-22 were synthe-
sized from 3-amino phenyltetrazole (4) or 3-amino-N-methyl-</p>

<p>benzamide (5) reacting with the corresponding aryl/heteroaryl 
sulfonyl chloride to give good to excellent yields. 
[27] N-Methy-
lated arylsulfonamide 25 was synthesized from 3-amino benzo-
nitrile (23) as shown in Scheme 2. First, the sulfonylation of 4-
bromo-5-chlorothiophene-2-sulfonyl chloride with 23 gave the 
desired product, 4-bromo-5-chloro-N-(3-cyanophenyl)thio-
phene-2-sulfonamide, which was used without purification for 
further treatment with methyl iodide in presence of sodium 
hydride to afford compound 24 in 78 % overall yield. The tetra-
zole ring formation starting from cyanophenyl sulfonamide 
(24) was successfully achieved via the reported method of 
Koguro et al. 
[28] by using sodium azide and triethylammonium 
hydrochloride salt in dry toluene to deliver product 25 in 71 % 
yield. For the synthesis of compound 27, 4-bromo-5-chloro-
thiophene-2-carboxylic acid was coupled with 3-amino phenyl-
tetrazole via standard peptide coupling conditions using ben-
zotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophos-
phate (PyBOP) as a peptide coupling reagent for 18 hours at 
25 8C with dimethylformamide (DMF) as the solvent 
(Scheme 3). </p>

<p>The biological data from the evaluation of 3, 7-22, 25, and 
27 as inhibitors of IRAP are presented in Table 1. The NH 
group on the tetrazole ring seems essential to the inhibitory 
activity since methylation of the nitrogen affords inactive com-
pound 7. To find out whether a considerably less acidic NH is 
sufficient for activity, compound 8 was evaluated and found to 
be inactive as well. Apparently a tetrazole with an acidic hydro-</p>

<p>gen but neither a carboxylate nor amide in the meta 
position of the aromatic ring results in IRAP inhibitory 
activity. 
Classic bacteriostatic arylsulfonamides, such as sul-
famethoxazole and sulfadiazine, which are structural-
ly similar to 3, are weak acids. The presence of the 
moderately acidic NH is important to retain activity 
since methylation, leading to 25, rendered a consider-
ably less potent inhibitor. Furthermore, displacement 
of the sulfonamide linker for an amide provided the </p>

<p>weak inhibitor 27. The loss of most of the inhibitory potency 
of 27 could be attributed to 1) the restricted rotation of the 
amide bond not allowing adoption of an optimal binding to 
IRAP, 2) the loss of an acidic NH, or alternatively 3) the sulfona-
mide oxygen(s) being crucial for binding. Substitution of the 4-
bromo for a 4-chloro group to provide 9 did not result in an 
improvement in the inhibitory activity, but substitution of the 
thiophene for a benzene ring resulted in a small improvement 
(c.f., compounds 9 and 10). Furthermore, an additional chloro 
substituent in the ortho position rendered an inhibitor with 
a good inhibitory capacity (11). A fluoro group in the ortho po-
sition of a para bromo derivative (12) provided a potent inhibi-
tor while with two ortho substituents, as in compound 13, a de-
cline in potency was observed. Compound 14 with two methyl 
groups located in the meta and para positions exhibited good 
potency, but biphenyl compound 15 was found to be more 
than ten times less active (IC 50 = 3.1 AE1.8 vs 44 AE 3.3 mm). The 
observation that a chloro or fluoro substituent was accepted in 
the ortho position by the enzyme prompted us to make the 
more bulky annelated benzooxadiazole derivative (16), which 
acted as a potent IRAP inhibitor. Benzothiophenes 17 and 18 
and methylindole derivative 19 were approximately 10 times 
less active as inhibitors. 
It is notable that the nonsubstituted thiophene, benzene, 
and pyridine derivatives 20, 21, and 22, respectively, exhibited 
all very poor abilities to inhibit the protease. Furthermore, IRAP 
inhibitors 10, 14, and 16 exhibited a more than 10-fold prefer-
ence for IRAP than for the protein homologue aminopepti-
dase N (APN) (unpublished data). 
In an attempt to rationalize the observed activities of the 
synthesized compounds, a docking study of the series was 
conducted using Glide (version 5.8; for details, see Experimen-
tal Section). To date, no crystal structure of IRAP has been re-
ported. In order to model the binding of the inhibitors, we uti-
lized APN for which several high-resolution protein-ligand co-
crystal structures have been reported. 
[30] Twelve of the sixteen 
amino acids that are found in the catalytic site of APN are con-
served in IRAP, where the catalytic site is defined as within 3 
of Val and Tyr in Ang IV when co-crystallized in APN (PDB code 
4FYS </p>

<p>[30] </p>

<p>); see Supporting Information for sequence alignment. 
Since APN and IRAP have a high sequence identity in proximity 
to the catalytic zinc, where we hypothesize that the modeled 
ligands are binding, we find it reasonable to assume that 
models of the binding modes found in the catalytic region of 
APN can be extended to IRAP. 
The docking produced several possible binding modes but 
all with rather poor Glide docking scores. However, by visual 
inspection, we identified a potential binding mode of the 
series that to some extent accounts for the observed struc-
ture-activity relationships. Figure 1 shows this binding mode il-
lustrated using compound 3. In the proposed binding mode, 
the negatively charged tetrazole of 3 is involved in zinc bind-
ing and, in addition, is stabilized in the catalytic site by a hydro-
gen bond to Tyr 477 (IRAP: Tyr 549). This Tyr residue is highly 
conserved in the M1 family of metalloproteases and is indicat-
ed to be important for binding and stabilization of the catalyt-
ic transition state. 
[30] Furthermore, the compound is stacked </p>

<p>between Phe 472 (IRAP: Phe 544) and Phe 896 (IRAP: Tyr 961) in 
the active site. The stacking interaction with Phe 544 in IRAP 
has previously been reported as a key interaction for ligand 
and substrate binding. 
[31, 32] Two of the amino acids in contact 
with compound 3 differ between APN and IRAP. Phe 896 is re-
placed by Tyr in IRAP, and Gln 213 is replaced by Glu. We antici-
pate that the difference between the protein structures should 
not have a significant impact on the present binding mode 
model of 3 as the aromatic stacking interaction should remain 
largely the same changing from Phe to Tyr and since Gln 213 is 
not involved in any specific interaction with the ligand. 
This binding mode model fits nicely with the inactivity of 
the methylated tetrazole found in 7, which cannot produce 
a complimentary negative charge to the catalytic zinc. The 
model can possibly also account for the preference for tetra-
zole over carboxylic acid by the different directionality of their 
zinc binding moiety. Replacing the tetrazole with a carboxylic 
acid, the carboxylate interacts with the catalytic zinc in the 
least common anti interaction. 
[33] Furthermore, N-methylation 
of the sulfonamide in 25 would, in this binding mode, gener-
ate a steric clash with the enzyme, thus possibly explaining the 
decrease in activity caused by this structural modification. 
However, the decreased activity of compounds extended in 
the phenyl para position is not accounted for properly by this 
model. In order to fully conclude the binding mode of this 
series of compounds, more experimental information needs to 
be obtained. It is possible that a crystal structure of IRAP 
would reveal differences in structure that are hard to predict 
using the approach applied herein, and thus fully account for 
the observed structure-activity relationships. </p>

dase N (APN) active site (PDB code 4FYS

and Phe 896 are displayed in pink sticks, and Phe 472 is displayed in light

<p>Conclusions </p>

<p>New improved enhancers of cognitive functions are persistent-
ly desired for the treatment of the cognitive decline associated 
with Alzheimer's disease, brain trauma, and cerebral ischemia, 
since the clinical studies of the cholinesterase inhibitors and N-
methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists used today 
have been mostly disappointing. 
[34, 35] It is therefore not surpris-
ing that the receptor(s) involved in the beneficial effects of 
Ang IV has emerged as a relevant new target for drug inter-
vention. High-throughput screening of 10 500 low-molecular-
weight compounds resulted in a series of hits, one of which 
was sulfonamide 3. As deduced from an analysis of analogues 
to 3, for example the corresponding carboxylic acid that was 
assayed in the primary screen and found to be inactive, and 
from a small structure-activity relationship study involving 
compounds 3, 7-22, 25, and 27, it is concluded that the sulfo-
namide function and a tetrazole ring in the meta position of 
the aromatic ring are crucial for IRAP inhibition. Further optimi-
zation, together with characterization of their mechanism of 
action and modes of binding are required to make these com-
pounds attractive as research tools for in vivo studies and as 
potential cognitive enhancers. </p>

<p>Biology </p>

<p>The enzymatic assay applied for screening purposes as well as 
follow-up dose-response characterization was based on the use of 
membrane preparations from CHO cells as a source of enzymatic </p>

<p>activity. These cells are known to abundantly express IRAP and 
contain minimal amounts of contaminating APN activities. 
[36] The 
CHO cell membrane preparation was conducted based on the pro-
cedure described by Demaegt et al. 
[37] with lysis of washed cells 
being done by means of ultrasonication followed by multiple 
strokes (&gt; 20) with a Dounze homogenizer and a centrifugation 
(30 000 g for 30 min at 4 8C) procedure for pelleting and washing 
of the membranes. </p>

<p>The extent of enzymatic activity in each sample was quantified in 
a microtiter-based screening assay using the peptide-like substrate 
l-leucine-p-nitroanilide (l-Leu-pNA; Sigma-Aldrich, product no. 
L9125), which upon IRAP-mediated cleavage produces para-nitroa-
niline that absorbs at 405 nm. 
[37] The screening campaign was per-
formed at Chemical Biology Consortium Sweden (CBCS) using a pri-
mary screening set of 10 500 compounds 
[38] (majority of com-
pounds donated by Biovitrum AB, Stockholm, Sweden). The screen 
was conducted in a 384-well format, whereas follow-up dose-re-
sponse experiments were conducted in a transparent 96-well plate 
(Nunc, product no. 269620). </p>

<p>In this format, the final assay volume was 200 mL in an assay buffer 
consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm phenylme-
thanesulfonylfluoride (PMSF) at pH 7.4. The assays were conducted 
in the presence of a final concentration of 1 mm l-Leu-pNA and 
homogenized CHO cell membranes from 50 000-200 000 cells per 
well, depending on test occasion and membrane batch. The proto-
col for running the dose-response assay started with a serial dilu-
tion of the compound stock solutions at 10 mm in 99.9 % anhy-
drous DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) by a factor of 1/3 in columns 1-11 of 
the 96-well plates. Column 12 was reserved for controls: the equiv-
alent amount of DMSO was added to wells A12-D12 (negative 
controls representing 0 % inhibition of the enzyme), whereas 
a 10 mm stock solution of 3 was placed in wells E12-H12 serving 
as controls representing 100 % inhibition of the enzyme activity. 
The DMSO solutions were then diluted in assay buffer and trans-
ferred to the transparent assay plates in triplicate (50 mL to each 
well both for samples and controls), followed by addition of dilut-
ed homogenized CHO cell membranes (50 mL) and substrate 
(100 mL) to initiate the enzymatic reaction. The plates were covered 
and then incubated at RT until a statistically significant difference 
was observed (6-12 h) between the controls (Z' &gt; 0.8). Care was 
taken to ensure the readings were taken at a time point when the 
absorbance signal still increased linearly with time. Raw data were 
then imported into Microsoft Excel for conversion to % inhibition 
data based on the controls on each plate. After data from triplicate 
samples were averaged, the curves were fitted to a four-parameter 
dose-response model within XLfit (model 205) to obtain best-fit 
values for the IC 50 , Hill slope, and the upper and lower limits of the 
dose-response curve. </p>

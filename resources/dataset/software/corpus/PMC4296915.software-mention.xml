(Figure 2C). There were no significant differences between 
the groups (P=0.69). </p>

<p>Effect on exercise capacity </p>

<p>After 8 weeks of training, only patients in the SET group 
had clinically significant improvement in 6-MWD. The 
improvement was maintained until month 9 (Figure 3A). 
No statistically significant differences between the groups 
were detected throughout the follow-up period (P=0.065). 
After 4 weeks of training, only patients in the SET group 
had statistically significant improvement in endurance time 
(P,0.01). The improvement was maintained throughout 
the testing period (month 12; Figure 3B). Significant differ-
ences between groups were also detected at all follow-up 
visits (P,0.01). </p>

<p>effect on breathlessness </p>

<p>The dyspnea score by mMRC did not show clinically 
significant differences in both groups and the statistical 
significant differences between groups were only detected 
at months 3, 6, and 9 (P,0.05; Figure 4A). However, the 
dyspnea score showed clinically significant changes by TDI 
only in the SET group at all follow-up visits and so did </p>

<p>effect on hrQol </p>

<p>After 4 weeks of training, only patients in the SET group 
had clinically significant improvements in SGRQ score. The 
improvement was maintained till the end of follow-up period 
(Figure 5). The patients in the control group had clinically sig-
nificant improvements in SGRQ score only in months 3 and 21. 
The statistically significant differences in SGRQ score between 
the groups were detected at all follow-up visits (P=0.004). </p>

<p>effects on survival </p>

<p>The overall survival curves for both groups are shown in 
Figure 6. After 2 years of follow-up, 34 of the original 
41 patients were alive (survival rate, 82.9%), 24 of the 
27 patients in the SET group (88.9%) and 10 of the 14 patients 
in the control group (71.4%). The difference in survival 
rate of the patients between the groups was not statistically 
significant (P=0.092). </p>

<p>improved one month later. Some parameters (respiratory, 
upper and lower limb muscle strength, BDI/TDI, and QoL) 
were improved throughout the study period (24-month 
follow-up). In addition, these parameters were continually 
improved for quite a long period after SET ended. Although 
there was clinically significant improvement in the severity of 
dyspnea in the patients in the SET group measured by TDI, 
the dyspnea score measured by mMRC did not show clinically 
significant improvement. Therefore, we could conclude that 
the change in TDI is more sensitive than mMRC for measur-
ing the dyspnea severity. For exercise capacities, we measured 
both 6-MWD and endurance time. The 6-MWD started to 
improve clinically from month 2 and persistentally improved 
up to month 9. The endurance time started to significantly 
improve from month 1 (one month earlier than 6-MWD) 
and persistently improved throughout the one-year testing 
period (at least 3 months longer than 6-MWD). The earlier 
and persistently longer improvement of endurance time than 
the 6-MWD might indirectly reflect that endurance time is a 
more sensitive parameter than 6-MWD for measuring change 
of exercise capacity in COPD. The severity of dyspnea signifi-
cantly improved both clinically and statistically as indicated 
by the mean change in the TDI score but not by mMRC 
score. Other studies have suggested that the latter, by using 
a rougher scale, is not sensitive enough to detect changes in 
patients with advanced COPD. 31 For the QoL, the patients in 
the SET group showed persistent improvement throughout 
all visits over the 2-year period. Varying results on survival 
were reported in previous retrospective, non-randomized 
survival analyses. 1,32 Our results indicated that there was a 
slight but not significant difference in survival rate between 
the SET (89%) and the control (71%) groups. The absence of 
significant difference in survival rate between the SET and the 
control groups might be due to a small sample size, signifi-
cant dropout rate, and only a 2-year follow-up. As expected, 
FEV 1 was the most significant predictor of survival. Our SET 
program did not affect the measures of pulmonary function 
that were shown in previous studies to be significant predic-
tors of survival in patients with COPD. 33,34 
ATS/ERS had suggested that the exercise training pro-
gram should offer at least three sessions per week to achieve 
any physiologic benefits. 35 This was modified later to twice 
weekly supervised plus one unsupervised home session. Our 
results were contrary to those of Ringbaek et al 36 who did not 
find any improvement in exercise capacity while exercising 
twice a week for 8 weeks. The reason could be that our SET 
exercise program was more intensified and the patients were 
more deconditioned. </p>

<p>Although our study had benefits of training on 2-year 
follow-up, all outcome measurements showed peak response 
at month 9. These benefits, which were similar to other stud-
ies, suggested that after 9 months, the rehabilitation program 
should have some reinforcements after the core phase in 
the form of supervised periods of exercise, group sessions 
to discuss progress and problems, and the introduction of 
maintenance techniques. 32 
Our study had some limitations. First, the study was 
conducted in a single university-based center and it might 
not be applicable to large-scale practices, especially those 
that do not have specialized physiotherapists and nurses. 
Second, the study was not designed as a double-blinded 
randomized control trial with sham exercise in the con-
trol group; we had divided the patients following their 
preferences. The patients in SET group might have had 
more motivation for coping with their COPD than the 
control group and might have been more enthusiastic 
about continuing their self-exercise program after the first 
2 months of the intensive supervised one. Third, our study 
had significantly high dropout rates in both groups. There 
were 19.5% versus 50% and 49.1% versus 64.3% of patients 
dropped out from the study by 12 months and 24 months in 
the SET group versus the control group, respectively. The 
proportion of respondents declining rehabilitation appears 
similar to other studies (9%-50%). 37-40 </p>

<p>Conclusion </p>

<p>Our results confirm that the SET program, as an intensive 
ergometer exercise, is effective for patients with advanced 
COPD. This program proved to be a feasible approach for 
improving peripheral and respiratory muscle strengths, 
dyspnea, and QoL up to 2 years and exercise capacity up 
to at least the 9-month follow-up. These promising results 
should encourage the health care professionals to promote 
exercise training for patients with advanced COPD who are 
prone to limit most of their daily activities despite optimal 
medication control. </p>

<p>Abstract </p>

<p>Background: To determine the role of Letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, in the treatment of endometriotic 
pain. 
Methods: In this prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial in minimally invasive surgery research cen-
ter, 51 women with pelvic endometriosis and endometriotic pain (dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain) score 
of 5 or more (for at least one of these endometriotic pain), after laparoscopic diagnosis and conservative lapa-
roscopic surgery were treated with either Letrozole plus OCP (n=25) or only OCP (n=26) for 4 months continu-
ously. 
Results: Using VAS test, the score of dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain 4 months after the laparo-
scopic surgery declined significantly in both groups but the difference between results of the two groups was not 
significant. 
Conclusion: Both treatment modalities showed comparable effectiveness in the treatment of pains related to 
endometriosis and in comparison with OCP, Letrozole did not affect the outcome. </p>

<p>Introduction 
Presence of endometrial glandular and 
stromal cells outside the uterine cavity is 
called endometriosis which can be diag-
nosed by visual inspection of the pelvis 
during laparoscopy. The most common 
manifestations of endometriosis are 
dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain and 
infertility that can have important effects on 
the quality of life (1,2). Endometriosis is an 
estrogen dependent disease (3,4) and estra-
diol supports growth and inflammation 
process in endometriotic lesions (2,5). Al-
most all treatments for endometriosis 
(GNRH agonists, progestins, danazol, </p>

<p>OCP) have an effect on endometriosis by 
decreasing ovarian estrogen levels or an-
tagonize estrogen. 
In women, another estrogen source is an-
drogen change into estrogen in peripheral 
tissues by aromatase P 450 enzyme (1,6). 
Aromatase is a key enzyme in the synthesis 
of estrogens. Aromatization is the last step 
in estradiol biosynthesis (3). Aromatase 
mediates the conversion of androstendione 
and testosterone to estrogens. Perhaps inhi-
bition of aromatase enzyme and decreasing 
the peripheral conversion of androgens to 
estrogen could have a therapeutic effect as 
inhibition of endometriotic foci. Letrozole </p>

<p>is a drug that can inhibit aromatase enzyme 
and in some studies on animal models (rats, 
mice and baboons) it has led to the reduc-
tion in the size of endometriotic implants 
(7-10). Letrozole is a drug that inhibits the 
aromatase enzyme by competitively bind-
ing to the cytochrome P 450 subunit of the 
enzyme, resulting in a reduction of estrogen 
biosynthesis in all tissues. Elevated levels 
of aromatase have been found in endome-
triotic lesions (11). Therefore, aromatase 
inhibitors maybe effective in treating en-
dometriosis related pelvic pain. </p>

<p>Methods 
This study was conducted as a random-
ized controlled trial to assess the effect of 
Letrozole on pain due endometriosis. As 
Letrozole can activate ovulation and is also 
a teratogen (12), during its use the patient 
must take contraception. We prescribed 
Letrozole in combination with OCP in one 
group and in the control group we pre-
scribed OCP only. Our sample was com-
posed of the patients with at least one kind 
of endometriotic pain (dyspareunia, dys-
menorrhea, pelvic pain) who were diag-
nosed as endometriotic by laparoscopy. 
Laparoscopy was performed under general 
anesthesia using the triple puncture tech-
nique. On laparoscopy, the surgeon tried to 
excise or ablate all the endometriotic im-
plants and adhesiolysis was also performed. 
The day before laparoscopy, a data collec-
tion form was filled by a physician. The 
severity of dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea and 
pelvic pain was estimated by Visual Ana-
logue Scale test (VAS test). Scale 0 was no 
pain and 10 was the most severe pain ever 
experienced. Those patients who had the 
score of 5 or more before the operation for 
one 
of 
their 
painful 
symptoms 
(dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain) 
were included in our study. After operation, 
the severity of endometriosis was written in 
the data collection form as revised Ameri-
can Society for Reproductive Medicine 
classification (ASRM) scores for endome-
triosis (1,13). 
With the acceptance of ethic committee </p>

<p>of Tehran University of Medical Sciences 
and obtaining informed consent in cases of 
Letrozole prescription, we prescribed OCP 
(Levonorgestrel 0.15 mg plus Ethinyl Es-
tradiol 0.03 mg, Iran Hormon, Tehran, Iran) 
daily for 4 months continuously in control 
group and OCP in combination with oral 
Letrozole (Femara, 2.5 mg-Novartis-
Switzerland) daily for 4 months continu-
ously in another group. Both groups took 
vitamin D 400IU plus Calcium 1 gram 
(Schiff, USA) daily for 4 months. All of the 
samples were the patients who had not 
planned to become pregnant after dis-
charge. We randomized the patients by as-
signing to the case and control groups al-
ternately in the order of their admission. 
Patients were evaluated at one and four 
months after operation and after starting 
medical treatment by office visits and tele-
phone inquiry for severity of their endome-
triotic pain and drug compliance. The pa-
tients did not have any other medical or 
systemic diseases. Before initiation of 
treatment, liver function tests, serum urea, 
creatinin, lipids and plasma glucose were 
checked. 
We analyzed the data by <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version">13</rs>, using 
the KS test (One-sample Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test) for normality of data distribu-
tion, Levene's test for equality of variances 
and independent samples t-test for equality 
of means for comparing quantitative nor-
mal data between two groups, paired sam-
ple t-tests for comparing quantitative nor-
mal data between before and after treatment 
in each group and Pearson Chi-square test 
for matching and comparing categorical 
variables between two groups. According 
to the KS test, we compared the non-
normal quantitative data by Mann-Whitney 
U nonparametric test between two groups 
and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test for com-
paring before and after treatment data in 
each group.The categorical variables, be-
fore and after medical treatment were ana-
lyzed by Mc Nemar test. </p>

<p>zole plus OCP group (L group) and 26 pa-
tients in OCP group (O group). The age 
range was 20 -43 years old. 10 patients 
from L group and 12 patients from O group 
were single and had not sexual contact. The 
patients in the L group were matched with 
O group for marital status, severity of en-
dometriosis and severity of pelvic pain so 
that there had been no significant differ-
ences (Table 1). 
All the patients reported improvement in 
the pain score within one month and four 
months of initiation of medical treatment. 
The pain scores continued to decrease dur-
ing the course of the treatment. All of the </p>

<p>patients developed amenorrhea after initia-
tion of therapy and none of them had bone 
pain. 
There was no significant difference in se-
verity of dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea and 
pelvic pain between the two groups before 
and after treatment, but after treatment the 
severity of the 3 mentioned symptoms was 
significantly reduced in both groups in 
comparison with their pretreatment status 
(Table 1,5). 
None of the patients developed any side-
effects of Letrozole or OCP and all contin-
ued the prescribed medication for 4 
months. </p>

<p>Effect of Letrozole on endometriosis-related pelvic pain </p>



<p>MJIRI, Vol. 28.107. 4 October 2014 </p>

<p>http://mjiri.iums.ac.ir </p>

<p>Discussion 
The major finding of this prospective, 
randomized trial of Letrozole plus OCP 
versus OCP in the treatment of endometri-
otic pelvic pain after ablative surgery was 
that there was no significant difference in 
outcome between the two groups and the 
results of both treatment modalities were 
similar. 
The highest level of aromatase in 
premenopausal women is in ovary. There </p>

<p>are observations of increased expression of 
aromatase P 450 in endometriotic tissues 
(11,14-16) and aromatase inhibitors had 
been successful in regressing endometriotic 
tissue (17) and decreasing pelvic pain (17- 22). 
In a retrospective study by Abushahin et 
al. on 16 patients with endometriosis and 
chronic pelvic pain Letrozole 2.5 mg plus 
norethindrone acetate 2.5mg daily for 6 
months improved pain symptoms, however </p>

<p>pain recurred after treatment was complet-
ed (19). In another study by Verma et al. on 
4 premenopausal women with endometrio-
sis prescription of 2.5mg Letrozole plus 
2.5mg norethisterone daily for 6 months, 
the mean pain score fell from 9 prior to the 
treatment to 4.5 at the end of treatment (4). 
In a prospective study by Ailawadi et al. on 
10 patients with endometriosis and chronic 
pelvic pain, they prescribed 2.5mg per day 
Letrozole plus norethinderone for 6 months 
and after that they did a second-look lapa-
roscopy. On laparoscopy, there was no his-
tologic evidence of endometriosis and pel-
vic pain score decreased significantly in 
response to treatment (17). In a study by 
Amesterdam et al., Anastrozole and OCP 
continuously for 6 months made reduction 
of pain in 93% of cases (23). In a study by 
Seal et al., 5 patients with ovarian endome-
trioma used letrozole, 2.5mg per day plus 
OCP for 6 months and they found disap-
pearance of ovarian endometrioma and re-
duction of pain scores (24). </p>

<p>We did not use Letrozole with progestins 
because of break through bleeding and that 
they could not make adequate contraceptive 
effect (because Letrozole is teratogen and 
during its use, the patient must have effec-
tive contraception. In our study, the results 
of OCP prescription for endometriotic pain 
in comparison with Letrozole plus OCP 
were similar. </p>

<p>Limitations 
1. We prescribed Letrozole in combina-
tion with OCP and the pain reduced signifi-
cantly, but it is not known that the reduc-
tion in pain severity is due to OCP as a 
standard regimen for endometriosis or due 
to Letrozole itself or synergistic effect of 
the two. Therefore, we suggest another 
study to be conducted using larger sample 
sizes on single sexually inactive women to 
know the isolated effect of Lerozole on 
pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea secondary to 
endometriosis. 
2. We did not perform a second-look lap-</p>

<p>aroscopy to determine the effect of treat-
ment on the size of endometriotic lesions. 
Of course it is possible that Letrozole has a 
reductive effect on the size of the endome-
triotic lesion without significant reduction 
in severity of subjective pain experience in 
patients, because the severity of symptoms 
is not directly related to the severity of en-
dometriosis (1). </p>

<p>Conclusion 
The outcomes of 2 groups were similar so 
we may can conclude that Letrozole had 
not any positive effect on decreasing en-
dometriotic pain. </p>

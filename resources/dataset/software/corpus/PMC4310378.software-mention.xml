<p>Background--Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a novel inflammatory marker produced by various cell types including those of the vasculature 
and the heart. The relationship between inflammatory markers and prognosis of patients with heart failure with normal ejection 
fraction (HFNEF) remains unknown. We investigated whether plasma PTX3 levels can predict future cardiovascular events in 
patients with HFNEF. </p>

<p>Methods and Results--Plasma PTX3, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and B-type natriuretic peptide levels were measured 
prospectively in 360 stable patients with HFNEF. The subsequent incidence of cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular 
death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina pectoris, nonfatal ischemic stroke, hospitalization for heart failure 
decompensation, and coronary revascularization, was determined. During a mean 30-month follow-up, 106 patients experienced 
cardiovascular events. These events were more frequent in patients with high plasma PTX3 levels (&gt;3.0 ng/mL) than low levels 
(≤3.0 ng/mL). Multivariable Cox hazard analysis showed that PTX3 (hazard ratio: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.27; P&lt;0.01) and B-type 
natriuretic peptide (hazard ratio: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.14; P&lt;0.001), but not high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, were 
significant predictors of future cardiovascular events. Multivariable Cox analysis with the forced inclusion model, including 5 
previously identified prognostic factors, found that PTX3 was a significant predictor of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio: 1.16; 
95% CI: 1.06 to 1.27; P&lt;0.01). The C-statistics for cardiovascular events substantially increased from 0.617 to 0.683 when PTX3 
was added to the 5 previously identified prognostic factors. </p>

<p>Conclusions--High plasma PTX3 levels, but not other inflammatory markers, are correlated with future cardiovascular events in 
patients with HFNEF. PTX3 may be a useful biomarker for assessment of risk stratification in HFNEF. </p>

<p>ORIGINAL RESEARCH </p>

<p>those for inflammation and neurohormones, provide impor-
tant information about the pathogenesis, risk stratification, 
and diagnosis of HF and are used to monitor response to 
therapy. 
4 Inflammatory markers are closely associated with </p>

<p>pathogenesis, poor functional state, and adverse prognosis 
in patients with HF. 
Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a newly identified member of the 
pentraxin superfamily, which includes C-reactive protein (CRP) 
and serum amyloid P. In contrast to CRP, which is produced 
by the liver, PTX3 is produced by various cell types in various 
tissues, especially in the vasculature, in response to inflam-
matory stimuli. 
5 PTX3 may reflect local inflammatory status in </p>

<p>tissues and thus may be a new biomarker of inflammation. </p>

<p>6 </p>

<p>We recently demonstrated that plasma levels of PTX3, but not 
high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), were significantly higher in 
patients with HFNEF than in non-HF patients. 
7 In addition, </p>

<p>these elevated levels of PTX3 were significantly and indepen-
dently correlated with the presence of HFNEF in patients with 
normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). 
7 Other studies </p>

<p>have also shown that PTX3 is a predictor of adverse clinical 
outcome in patients with HFREF. 
8,9 Consequently, PTX3 may </p>

<p>be a useful inflammatory marker in cardiovascular medicine. 
Although much attention has been focused on HFREF, 
less is known regarding factors that correlate with clinical 
outcome in patients with HFNEF. The Irbesartan in Heart 
Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction (I-PRESERVE) study 
demonstrated that age, presence of diabetes mellitus, history 
of hospitalization for HF, New York Heart Association 
classification, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels, 
and LVEF were associated with adverse outcomes in patients 
with HFNEF. 
10 The relationships between inflammatory </p>

<p>markers and prognosis in HFNEF, however, remain unknown. 
This study was designed to determine the ability of plasma 
PTX3 levels to predict future cardiovascular events in patients 
with HFNEF. </p>

<p>Methods </p>

<p>Patients and Protocol </p>

<p>We initially screened 747 chronic HF patients under a 
clinically stable condition with New York Heart Association 
functional class II to IV who were referred to Kumamoto 
University Hospital, Kumamoto, Japan. We did not include 
decompensated HF patients with acute HF. The diagnosis of 
HF was based on the Framingham criteria for HF. 
11 None of </p>

<p>the patients had any noncardiac causes of HF-like symptoms, 
especially lung disease (eg, chronic obstructive lung disease). 
The diagnosis of HFNEF was based on the criteria formulated 
by the European Working Group on HFNEF. 
12 HFREF was </p>

<p>defined as reduced systolic left ventricular (LV) function 
(LVEF≤50%). HFNEF was defined as normal or mildly abnormal </p>

<p>systolic LV function (LVEF&gt;50%) with LV diastolic dysfunction. 
LV diastolic dysfunction for HFNEF was defined as (1) a ratio 
of mitral early diastolic peak flow velocity to tissue Doppler 
early mitral annular diastolic velocity (E/e') ≥15; (2) E/e' ≥8 
and &lt;15 and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels &gt;200 pg/ 
mL; or (3) E/e' ≥8 and &lt;15 and LV mass index (LVMI) 
≥122 g/m 
2 (females) or 149 g/m 
2 (males). Patients were </p>

<p>excluded if they had active systemic inflammatory disease, 
chronic renal failure requiring hemodialysis, collagen disease, 
presence of malignancy, or acute coronary syndrome within 
3 months preceding enrollment. Twenty-three HF patients 
with normal LVEF who did not meet these criteria were 
excluded. The study finally enrolled 360 patients with HFNEF 
(Figure 1). The study complied with the Declaration of 
Helsinki regarding investigation in humans and was approved 
by the institutional review committee of each institution. The 
study was also conducted in accordance with the guidelines 
of the ethics committee of our institution. Written informed 
consent was obtained from all patients. This study was 
registered at the University Hospital Medical Information 
Network Clinical Trials Registry with the identification number 
UMIN000002170. </p>

<p>ORIGINAL RESEARCH </p>

<p>Measurement of Plasma PTX3 Levels and Other 
Blood Parameters </p>

<p>Venous blood samples were obtained from patients under 
clinically stable and fasting conditions. Serum and plasma 
samples were kept frozen at À80°C until later tests. The 
estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated using the 
Japanese Society of Nephrology formula. 
13 PTX3 levels were </p>

<p>measured using a high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosor-
bent assay system (values ranged from 0.1 to 20 ng/mL; 
Perseus Proteomics). Other factors that were measured 
included serum hs-CRP levels and plasma tumor necrosis 
factor-a, interleukin-6, and BNP levels. </p>

<p>Doppler Echocardiography </p>

<p>Echocardiography was performed in standard parasternal and 
apical views by a specialized echocardiologist using commer-
cially available ultrasound systems (Vivid 7, GE-Vingmed 
Ultrasound; Aplio XG, Toshiba). LVEF was measured in biplane 
apical (2-and 4-chamber) views using a modification of 
Simpson's method. The E/e' ratio is used as an index of LV 
filling pressure and abnormal LV relaxation. 
14 To assess LV </p>

<p>diastolic function, E/e' was measured, as described previ-
ously, 
15 as was the medial annulus of E/e'. LV mass was </p>

<p>calculated, as described previously, 
16 and the LVMI was </p>

<p>expressed relative to body surface area. </p>

<p>Follow-up </p>

<p>Patients with HFNEF were followed prospectively at the 
outpatient clinic until December 2012 or until an endpoint 
occurred. The endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular 
death, nonfatal MI, unstable angina pectoris, nonfatal ische-
mic stroke, hospitalization for HF decompensation, or 
coronary revascularization. Cardiovascular events were ascer-
tained from a review of medical records and confirmed by 
direct contact with the patients, their families, and physicians. 
Patients were divided into low-and high-PTX3 groups based 
on the median concentration of PTX3 (3.0 ng/mL). </p>

<p>Definition of Cardiovascular Events </p>

<p>Cardiovascular death was defined as death because of MI 
(within 28 days), congestive heart failure, or documented 
sudden death without apparent noncardiovascular causes. MI 
was diagnosed as a rise or fall in cardiac biomarkers (plasma 
creatine kinase-MB or cardiac troponin-T) greater than the 99th 
percentile of the upper limit of normal, together with evidence 
of myocardial ischemia with at least one of the following: ECG 
changes (recent ST-T changes, left bundle branch block, or a 
pathological Q wave) or imaging evidence of new loss of viable </p>

<p>myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality. </p>

<p>17 </p>

<p>Unstable angina pectoris was diagnosed from new or acceler-
ating symptoms of myocardial ischemia accompanied by recent 
ischemic ST-T-wave changes. Ischemic stroke was diagnosed 
by both neurological symptoms and radiological evidence, 
excluding intracranial hemorrhage. Hospitalization for HF 
decompensation was defined as admission for symptoms 
typical of HF with objective signs of worsening HF requiring 
intravenous drug administration. Coronary revascularization 
was defined as coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous 
coronary intervention in patients with stable angina pectoris. 
For subjects experiencing 2 or more cardiovascular events, only 
the first event was considered in the analysis. </p>

<p>Statistical Analysis </p>

<p>Parameters with a normal distribution, as assessed by the 
Shapiro-Wilk test, are expressed as meanAESD. Parameters 
with a skewed distribution, such as PTX3, hs-CRP, tumor 
necrosis factor-a, interleukin-6, and BNP levels, as well as E/e' 
and LVMI, are shown as median values (interquartile range) 
and were logarithmically transformed before linear regression 
analysis. Differences between continuous variables were 
analyzed by the unpaired t test and the Mann-Whitney U test, 
as appropriate. Differences between categorical variables were 
analyzed by the chi-square test. Linear regression analysis was 
used to determine the associations between PTX3 and BNP 
levels, LVMI, inflammatory makers, and cardiovascular events. 
Survival data were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and 
assessed by the log-rank test. Age-and sex-adjusted event 
rates were calculated by multivariable logistic regression 
analyses. The ability of any marker to predict cardiovascular 
events was assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression 
analysis. In Cox proportional hazards regression analyses, 
associations between groups and all other parameters were 
first analyzed by univariate analysis followed by multivariable 
analysis after adjustment for factors that were significant with 
univariate analysis. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards 
regression analyses were also performed using forced inclu-
sion models. Model 1 incorporated the inflammatory makers 
PTX3, hs-CRP, tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-6, and BNP. 
Model 2 incorporated the 5 prognostic factors (PF5) that were 
identified during the I-PRESERVE study 
10 in patients with </p>

<p>HFNEF-age, presence of diabetes mellitus, previous hospi-
talization for HF, New York Heart Association classification, 
and LVEF-as well as BNP and PTX3. Model 3 incorporated 
PF5, BNP, and hs-CRP. Model 4 incorporated PF5, BNP, hs-
CRP, and PTX3. Estimates of the C-statistic for Cox propor-
tional hazards regression models were calculated. 
18-20 C-</p>

<p>statistics were estimated after PTX3 and BNP levels were 
added to PF5.

<p>regression models was also performed by the Grønnesby and 
Borgan calibration test. 
21 The incremental effects of addition </p>

<p>of PTX3 to PF5 and BNP levels to predict future cardiovascular 
events were evaluated using the net classification index (NRI), 
as previously described. 
22 Patients were stratified into 1 of 3 </p>

<p>risk categories based on PF5 and BNP levels measured during 
the mean 30-month follow-up period: low risk (0% to &lt;10%), 
intermediate risk (10% to 20%), or high risk (&gt;20%). PTX3 was 
subsequently used to reclassify the risk category for ascer-
taining whether there would be improvement in the NRI. The 
NRI was calculated using the following equation: NRI=([number 
of events reclassified as higherÀnumber of events reclassified 
as lower]/number of events)À([number of nonevents reclas-
sified as lowerÀnumber of nonevents reclassified as higher]/ 
number of nonevents). A P value &lt;0.05 was considered 
significant.

<p>Results </p>

<p>Patient Characteristics </p>

<p>Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics of the participating 
patients. The median PTX3 level was 3.0 ng/mL. Mean age, 
New York Heart Association class, and BNP levels were higher 
and mean body mass index, waist circumference and 
estimated glomerular filtration rate were lower in the high-
PTX3 group (&gt;3.0 ng/mL) than in the low-PTX3 group 
(≤3.0 ng/mL). LVMI values were significantly higher in the 
high-PTX3 group than in the low-PTX3 group, whereas LVEF 
and E/e' were similar in these 2 groups. Simple linear 
regression analysis showed a positive and significant corre-
lation between Ln(PTX3) and Ln(BNP) (r=0.295, P&lt;0.001) 
(Figure 2A) and a significant but weak positive correlation 
between Ln(PTX3) and Ln(LVMI) (r=0.114, P&lt;0.05) (Fig-
ure 2B). Furthermore, simple linear regression analysis 
showed a significant but weak positive correlation between 
Ln(PTX3) and Ln(tumor necrosis factor-a) (r=0.106, P&lt;0.05) 
but not Ln(hs-CRP) (P=0.11) or Ln(interleukin-6) (P=0.80). </p>

<p>Cardiovascular Events </p>

<p>Cardiovascular events were analyzed over time in 360 
patients with HFNEF. The mean follow-up period was 
30 months (range: 1 to 59 months). During this time, 106 
of these patients experienced cardiovascular events, including 
cardiovascular death (n=9), nonfatal MI (n=4), unstable angina 
pectoris (n=13), ischemic stroke (n=9), hospitalization for HF 
decompensation (n=41), and coronary revascularization 
(n=30). The frequency of cardiovascular events was signifi-
cantly higher in the high-PTX3 group (n=75) than in the </p>

<p>low-PTX3 group (n=31, P&lt;0.001) (Table 2). HF-related car-
diovascular events, including cardiovascular death and hos-
pitalization for HF decompensation, were significantly higher 
in the high-PTX3 group (n=41) than in the low-PTX3 group 
(n=9) (P&lt;0.001) (Table 2). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that 
the probability of cardiovascular events was also significantly 
higher in the high-PTX3 group than in the low-PTX3 group 
(P&lt;0.001, log-rank test) (Figure 3A). 
The combination of PTX3 and BNP levels led to identifica-
tion of subgroups (n=116, high-PTX3 and BNP group; n=64, 
high-PTX3 and low-BNP group; n=64, low-PTX3 and high-BNP 
group; and n=116, low-PTX3 and BNP group) with significantly 
different probabilities of cardiovascular events (P&lt;0.001, log-
rank test) (Figure 3B). In the low-BNP (P=0.02) and high-BNP 
(P&lt;0.01) groups, the probability of cardiovascular events was 
significantly higher in those with high PTX3 levels than in 
those with low PTX3 levels. Even among patients with mild HF 
symptoms (New York Heart Association class II), the 
outcomes were poorer in patients with high PTX3 levels than 
in those with low PTX3 levels (P&lt;0.001, log-rank test) 
(Figure 3C). </p>

<p>Cox Proportional Hazards Analysis and C-
Statistics for Cardiovascular Events </p>

<p>The results of univariate and multivariable Cox proportional 
hazards analyses for cardiovascular events are shown in 
Tables 3 and 4. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards 
analysis identified PTX3 (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.16; 95% CI: 
1.05 to 1.27; P&lt;0.01), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(HR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.97 to 0.99; P&lt;0.05), LVMI (HR: 1.03; 95% 
CI: 1.05 to 1.27), and BNP (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.14; 
P&lt;0.001) as predictors of future cardiovascular events after 
adjustment for significant factors that were identified by 
univariate analysis (Table 3). Using the forced inclusion 
model, which evaluated levels of inflammatory markers and 
BNP (model 1) in multivariable Cox hazards analysis, PTX3, 
but not hs-CRP, significantly predicted cardiovascular events 
(HR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.28; P&lt;0.001). In the forced 
inclusion model, which included PF5 and BNP, PTX3 signif-
icantly predicted cardiovascular events (model 2: HR: 1.16; 
95% CI: 1.05 to 1.27; P&lt;0.01; model 4: HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.06 
to 1.27; P&lt;0.01) (Table 4). Furthermore, multivariable Cox 
proportional hazards analysis identified PTX3 (HR: 1.16; 95% 
CI: 1.01 to 1.35; P&lt;0.05) and BNP (HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.11 to 
1.31; P&lt;0.001) as predictors of future HF-related cardiovas-
cular events, including cardiovascular death and hospitaliza-
tion for HF decompensation, after adjustment for significant 
factors identified by univariate analysis. We classified patients 
with HFNEF into 4 groups according to the levels of Ln(PTX3): 
first quartile (&lt;0.59, PTX3: &lt;1.80 ng/mL), second quartile 
(0.59 to 1.10, PTX3: 1.80 to 3.00 ng/mL), third quartile (1.10 </p>

<p>to 1.35, PTX3: 3.00 to 3.85 ng/mL), and fourth quartile 
(&gt;1.35, PTX3: &gt;3.85 ng/mL); the relative risk of total 
cardiovascular events was 1 (reference), 1.36, 2.71 
(P&lt;0.001 versus the reference), and 3.17 (P&lt;0.001 versus 
the reference), respectively. The log-transformation values of 
PTX3 demonstrated a linear association with the occurrence 
of cardiovascular events in patients with HFNEF (r=0.965, 
P=0.03). 
We also estimated the C-statistics of PF5 alone. Separate 
incorporation of PTX3 and BNP into PF5 increased the C-
statistics for the prediction of future cardiovascular events 
from 0.617 for PF5 alone to 0.656 for PF5 plus PTX3 and PF5 
plus BNP (Table 5). Moreover, incorporation of PTX3 and BNP 
into PF5 increased the C-statistics to 0.683 (P&lt;0.05). In 
addition, the PF5 plus BNP plus PTX3 model performed better 
than the PF5 plus BNP model (C-statistics: 0.683 versus 
0.656). The Schoenfeld test indicated that the proportional 
hazards assumptions were appropriate (P=0.46). We also 
confirmed good calibration for the analysis by Grønnesby and 
Borgan statistics (P=0.19). </p>

(Table 6). </p>

<p>PTX3 for Prediction of CV Events in HFNEF 
Matsubara et al </p>

<p>ORIGINAL RESEARCH </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to show a 
significant association between plasma levels of PTX3, a 
marker of inflammation, and adverse cardiovascular outcomes 
in patients with HFNEF. High plasma PTX3 levels can 
significantly predict future cardiovascular events in HFNEF 
patients. The addition of high PTX3 levels to the PF5 and BNP 
levels, which were previously found to be prognostic in 
patients with HFNEF, improved their risk stratification, as 
indicated by a substantial increase in the C-statistics and 
significance of NRI. </p>

<p>Activation of the inflammatory process is important in the 
pathogenesis of HF and in adverse prognosis of patients with 
this condition. Several studies have investigated the role of 
inflammation as a therapeutic target, although initial trials 
had limited success. 
23 Consequently, specific anti-inflamma-</p>

<p>tory approaches for the different types and stages of HF (ie, 
HFNEF and HFREF) remain a priority, as does a better 
understanding of the mechanisms underlying HF-related 
inflammation. The established inflammatory marker hs-CRP 
is an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality in 
patients with HF. 
24-26 Elevated CRP levels predict hospital-</p>

<p>ization of HF patients, although the association between CRP 
and HF events is no longer significant after adjustment for 
the presence of LV diastolic dysfunction. 
27 Consequently, the </p>

<p>relationships between inflammatory markers and the prog-
nosis of patients with HFNEF remain unclear. Myocardial 
remodeling differs in HFNEF and HFREF. 
28 In HFREF, </p>

<p>remodeling is driven by the loss of cardiomyocytes, whereas 
in HFNEF, a systemic inflammatory state induces oxidative 
stress in the coronary microvascular endothelium, which 
drives myocardial dysfunction and remodeling. 
28 Other </p>

<p>studies have shown that serum levels of inflammatory 
cytokines are high in patients with HFNEF 
29 and that </p>

<p>interleukin-16, a cytokine considered an important mediator 
in inflammation, promotes cardiac fibrosis and myocardial 
stiffening in HFNEF. 
30 Consequently, investigating the rela-</p>

<p>tionships between inflammatory markers and prognosis in 
HFNEF is important. We observed a significant correlation 
between plasma levels of PTX3, a novel inflammatory maker, 
and future cardiovascular events in patients with HFNEF. 
Furthermore, considerable evidence suggests that PTX3 may 
better reflect local inflammatory status in tissues than does 
liver-derived CRP. 
6 We previously reported that PTX3 was </p>

<p>partly produced in the coronary circulation in patients with 
HFNEF. 
7 These results suggest that PTX3, rather than CRP, </p>

<p>reflects vascular and cardiac inflammation in patients with 
HFNEF and might be a cardiovascular biomarker for the 
assessment and management of HF. In the present study, we 
showed that increased inflammation as assessed by PTX3 
measurement was significantly associated with poor 
prognosis for HFNEF patients by multivariable Cox hazards 
analysis. Furthermore, the addition of 2 biomarkers-PTX3 
as an inflammation maker and BNP as a myocardial stress 
marker-to the previously established prognostic factors in 
the I-PRESERVE study 
10 of HFNEF patients improved their </p>

<p>risk stratification performance, as indicated by an increase in 
the C-statistics. These results suggest the possible relative 
merits of these 2 biomarkers for future risk management in 
HFNEF. In NRI analyses, the addition of PTX3 was able to 
provide a more appropriate risk assessment in patients who 
were evaluated as having a high risk state by previously 
described HFNEF prognostic factors (PF5 plus BNP) in </p>

<p>patients without cardiovascular events. Furthermore, the 
addition of PTX3 never resulted in a worse risk classification 
in patients with cardiovascular events. Consequently, the 
significance of NRI was shown by incorporating PTX3 into the 
new risk-assessment model. 
The site of PTX3 production in patients with HFNEF 
remains unclear. Under normal physiological conditions, 
PTX3 mRNA is not expressed in the heart. 
31 Under </p>

<p>pathological conditions, PTX3 is expressed in atherosclerotic 
lesions, 
32 adipose tissue, 
33 and the heart with acute and </p>

<p>sub-acute-phase HF 
34 ; however, the types of cells that </p>

<p>express PTX3 in failing hearts of patients with HFNEF and 
chronic HF have not been determined. HFNEF may result 
from the accumulation of extracellular matrix material within 
myocardial fibrosis. 
35,36 Accumulation of the extracellular </p>

<p>matrix (ie, fibrosis) may also be pathophysiologically impor-
tant in progression of the HFNEF disease process and be a 
contributor to subsequent events. 
37 HFNEF may also be </p>

<p>caused by structural and molecular abnormalities of the 
cardiovascular system, including cardiac and noncardiac 
factors, such as those associated with vascular functions. </p>

<p>PTX3 for Prediction of CV Events in HFNEF 
Matsubara et al </p>

<p>ORIGINAL RESEARCH </p>

<p>thelial dysfunction in the prognosis of patients with HFNEF, 
suggesting that improvement in endothelial function could 
be a potential therapeutic target in patients with HFNEF. </p>

<p>39 </p>

<p>PTX3 is produced by fibrous tissues and endothelial cells in 
response to inflammatory stimuli 
5 and is considered an </p>

<p>important marker of vascular pathology. 
40 In patients with </p>

<p>acute MI and infectious myocarditis, PTX3 is produced by 
macrophages, endothelial cells, and, to a lesser extent, 
myocardiocytes and is localized in the interstitium. 
34 The </p>

<p>interstitial localization of PTX3 in human failing hearts 
suggests that PTX3 is produced locally by fibroblasts in the 
cardiac interstitium. Consequently, in patients with HFNEF, 
PTX3 might be produced by myocardial fibroblasts and/or 
endothelial cells rather than in subclinical atherosclerotic 
lesions in patients with HFNEF. We found that the frequency 
of HF-related cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular </p>

<p>death and hospitalization for HF decompensation, was 
significantly higher in patients with high PTX3 levels than 
in those with low PTX3 levels. This finding suggests that 
PTX3 is more predictive of future HF-related cardiovascular 
events than of vascular events in patients with HFNEF. 
We used the median value of PTX3 (3.0 ng/mL) as the cutoff 
point in the present study. Several studies have investigated 
the association between PTX3 values and HF. Suzuki et al 
demonstrated that the median value of PTX3 was 3.7 ng/mL in 
patients with HFREF and split the patients into 2 groups: those 
above and those below 4.0 ng/mL. 
8 In this study, patients with </p>

<p>HFREF were targeted, and it has already been demonstrated 
that patients with HFREF have higher inflammatory activity than 
those with HFNEF. We previously demonstrated that the 75% 
range value of PTX3 was 2.90 ng/mL in non-HF patients with 
risk factors (hypertension, 67.8%; diabetes mellitus, 37.4%; 
dyslipidemia, 57.1%; and coronary artery disease, 55.0%). </p>

<p>7 </p>

<p>Furthermore, Inoue et al showed that PTX3 levels were 
&lt;2.28 ng/mL in healthy volunteers. 
41 In previous studies of </p>

<p>cardiovascular events in stable patients with coronary risk 
factors, the cutoff points of PTX3 were 2.83 
42 and 3.24 ng/ </p>

<p>mL. 
43 Thus, we consider that the median value of 3.0 ng/mL </p>

<p>for PTX3 was a clinically meaningful cutoff point in our study. 
The present study has several limitations. First, our study 
included only a relatively small number of patients in a single 
center. Second, the population of this study was relatively 
young and predominantly male; had a low prevalence of atrial 
fibrillation, a higher frequency of mild HF, relatively lower BNP 
levels; and had less frequent use of diuretics. Because our 
institution is an educational hospital and the design was a 
single-center study in Japan, the recruited patients with </p>

<p>PTX3 for Prediction of CV Events in HFNEF 
Matsubara et al </p>

<p>ORIGINAL RESEARCH </p>

<p>HFNEF might have had differences in characteristics com-
pared with those in Western studies. Consequently, a large, 
multiracial, multicenter study is required to confirm our 
results. Third, the pathogenetic role of high PTX3 levels in 
HFNEF remains unclear. Recent studies in mouse models 
have shown that PTX3 has a cardioprotective effect, </p>

<p>44,45 </p>

<p>suggesting that PTX3 might protect the cardiovascular system 
by modulating the immune-inflammatory balance. Further in 
vivo and in vitro experiments are required to determine the 
exact role of high PTX3 levels in HFNEF. 
Despite these limitations, our study provided the first 
evidence for the prognostic significance of PTX3 in HFNEF. A 
large-scale multicenter trial is warranted to further examine the 
pathological role and clinical significance of PTX3 in HFNEF. </p>

<p>Conclusion </p>

<p>High plasma PTX3 levels, but not other inflammatory markers 
including hs-CRP, are significantly correlated with future 
cardiovascular events in patients with HFNEF. Determination 
of PTX3 levels may provide incremental prognostic informa-
tion in patients with HFNEF. </p>

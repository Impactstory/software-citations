<p>Abstract </p>

<p>Background: Cell-based therapies can be used to treat neurological diseases and spinal cord injuries. The aim 
of this study was to assess the clinical outcome of bone marrow derived mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) trans-
plantation in patients with spinal cord injuries. 
Methods: Following a systematic review to detect clinical intervention studies, a meta-analysis was done for 
pooling data to estimate the outcome of BM-MNCs transplantation. The percentage of the patients with im-
proved ASIA scale from one grade to a higher grade was defined as the main outcome. By considering the study 
design and outcome measurement, two reviewers independently extracted the data. 
Results: Eight relevant primary studies were found; seven qualified studies, with a combined total of 328 pa-
tients were assessed by meta-analysis, including 314 ASIA-A, 13 ASIA-B, 94 cervical, 227 thoracic and 60 
acute injuries. The percentage of the patients' improvement was tested by meta-analysis through random and 
fixed models. The overall percentage of all patients' improved ASIA scale after a one-year follow-up (95% 
CIs) was 43 (0.27-0.59). 
Conclusion: Data from published trials revealed that encouraging results were achieved by autologous BM-
MNCs for the treatment of spinal cord injury. However, the number of clinical trials included in the systematic 
review was too limited to reach a definite conclusion. More qualified clinical trials with standardized methods 
are needed to truly justify the outcome of this therapeutic modality in SCI patients. </p>

<p>Introduction 
Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) occurs with a 
worldwide incidence of 15-40 cases per 
million people annually (1). Epidemiologi-
cal data concerning the global prevalence 
of SCI is inaccessible. Also, it is appraised 
that more than 130,000 patients suffer from 
SCI per year. The mean age of spinal cord </p>

<p>injury patients is 30 years, demonstrating 
that it disables persons in the prime of their 
lives. The high rate of incidence in adoles-
cent groups is reasoned to the road acci-
dents and sports related damages (2).Up to 
now, there is no cure available for these 
individuals, and SCI usually leads to im-
portant life-long disability (3,4). Despite a </p>

<p>lack of internationally accepted scientific 
evidences, cell-based therapies offer great 
promise for many currently intractable 
conditions including neurological disorders. 
Frequently mentioned targets include neu-
rological diseases and spinal cord injury 
(5). Different cell types have been studied 
in animal models and clinical trials. The 
bone marrow derived from mononuclear 
cells (BM-MNCs) is extracted from the 
bone marrow directly, or it is derived via 
mobilization into the peripheral blood using 
granulocyte 
colony-stimulating 
factor 
(GCSF) (6). BM-MNCs are the most com-
mon cell population used in neuropatholog-
ic insults. These cells have many ad-
vantages including easy and rapid isolation 
with minimal manipulation, ample cell 
number, low processing costs and a mini-
mally invasive bone marrow harvest proce-
dure (7). BM-MNCs have been reported to 
promote repair and regeneration of nervous 
tissue within the central and peripheral 
nervous system (8). It seems that BM-MNC 
can facilitate recovery from SCI by promot-
ing remyelinating spared white matter 
tracts or intensifying axonal growth (9). 
However, the transdifferentiation of BM 
cells into myelin cells is an area of great 
controversy, and there is no convulsive ev-
idence that these cells do this process with-
out extensive genetic and epigenetic ma-
nipulation. 
Although the results of pre-clinical stud-
ies recommend that BM-MNCs could be 
used as a potential therapy for SCI, (10) 
they have not clearly indicated whether the-
se cells have therapeutic advantages in SCI 
patients. Since BM-MNCs transplantation 
has been considered as a novel intervention 
in clinical trials for SCI, it has not been sci-
entifically proven to be safe and effective. 
This systematic review investigates the 
clinical outcome of BM-MNCs transplanta-
tion for patients with traumatic SCI. The 
objective was to determine whether BM-
MNC transplantation can increase ASIA 
scale, which is a valid and useful tool for 
determining the function maintained by a 
patient after suffering from spinal cord in-</p>

<p>juries (11). </p>

<p>Methods 
Search Strategy 
We performed PICOS framework (De-
termining patient, problem or population, 
intervention, comparison and outcome) to 
define the main concepts of the research 
questions. 
Patient: People with Spinal Cord Injury 
Intervention: Bone Marrow Transplanta-
tion 
Comparison: No Treatment 
Outcome: Improvement in the ASIA 
Score 
Computerized databases were searched 
on 28 October 2012. To retrieve both origi-
nal and secondary related studies, we used 
a sensitive librarian-assisted search strategy 
in the last available version of the three fol-
lowing databases at the time of the search: 
MEDLINE via Ovid SP (1948 to 28 Octo-
ber 2012), EMBASE via Ovid SP (1989 to 
27 October 2012) and CENTRAL via Ovid 
SP (September 2012). The search was lim-
ited to the English language. Search was 
updated on May 2013; however, no new 
records were found. Because of the low 
number of results in the primary search, we 
applied a sensitive search strategy to re-
trieve a suitable number of records and 
minimize any missing of possible related 
records. Therefore, we included only prob-
lem and intervention in PICOS structure of 
the formulated question to achieve higher 
sensitivity, and we did not limit our results 
to humans and particular types of study de-
signs. The database search was completed 
with a search of RCTs (Randomize Control 
Trials) registries and reviewing of the ref-
erence lists of the included studies along 
with citations. The following search strate-
gy was developed for MEDLINE via Ovid 
SP and was then adapted to other resources:

<p>III: I and II 
15. 8 and 14 </p>

<p>Inclusion criteria 
All those clinical trials which measured 
neurological assessment as ASIA scale pre-
and post-transplantation or those which in-
cluded participants with traumatic SCI 
(cervical or thoracic level) as well as ASIA 
(American Spinal Injury Association) scale 
A or B at baseline were included in this re-
view. </p>

<p>Exclusion criteria 
Animal studies were excluded in this re-
view. Other studies that did not report 
ASIA score as a clinical outcome along 
with those studies which considered other 
types of bone marrow derived cells or 
mixed cell population (BM-MSCs + BM-
MNCs) as well as case reports were ex-
cluded from this review. </p>

<p>Subgroups 
This review determined three subgroups 
on the basis of impairment scale, level of 
injury and duration of SCI. The ICCP (In-
ternational Campaign for Cures for spinal 
cord injury Paralysis) panel guideline men-</p>

<p>tioned that these variables can influence 
spontaneous recovery rate. However, a 
clinical trial considering ASIA -A patients 
showed less spontaneous improvement over 
time (18). This review analyzed patients 
with complete and incomplete ASIA sepa-
rately. In addition, the duration of SCI in 
terms of acute and chronic injuries was de-
fined, and the level of injury was divided 
into cervical and thoracic injury. </p>

<p>Data extraction 
Data extraction was conducted by two in-
dependent researchers of the study (M-Y 
and HR-A). Data pertaining to the number 
of the enrolled patients, injury types and 
levels, type and dose of cell transplants, 
duration of the follow ups and clinical out-
comes with confidence intervals were ex-
tracted from the papers. We defined the 
percentage of the patient's improvement 
from ASIA scale A to B/C or ASIA scale B 
to C/D as a clinical outcome after a one-
year follow-up. It should be noted that a 
clinical trial with a small size effect may 
need a more accurate outcome measure 
such as a statistically mean change in the 
motor and sensory scores (19). Therefore, 
we reported the mean change of the motor 
score and sensory score (light touch and 
Pinprick) at the time of the transplant and at 
the end of the last follow-up as a functional 
outcome in three studies (10, 14, 16). These 
studies reported the details of motor and 
sensory scores along with the ASIA scale. 
The confidence interval and lower and up-
per limits were not reported directly, so we 
calculated and recorded them using other 
indices which were based on formulas. </p>

<p>Synthesis of the results 
Meta-analysis was performed using the 
<rs id="software-0" type="software">STATA</rs> statistical package version <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version">11</rs>. 
First, we assessed the heterogeneity be-
tween the studies by Chi-squared test 
(P&lt;0.1 as meaningful). We used random or 
fixed model for pooling the percentage of 
improvement and 95% confidence intervals 
in case of heterogeneous and homogenous 
cases, respectively. In addition, p-values </p>

<p>less than 0.05 were regarded significant. 
The subgroups were determined based on 
the patients' injury type (impairment scale, 
level and stage of injury). ASIA-A, ASIA-
B, cervical, thoracic and acute patients 
were regarded as subgroups. Chronic sub-
groups were excluded from the meta-anal-
ysis because this subgroup included only 
one study. Due to the different characteris-
tics of each subgroup after excluding the 
chronic group from the analysis, we had to 
pool the data from the acute group sepa-
rately, not acute versus chronic; otherwise, 
the pooled estimate would have led to an 
inability in reaching a firm conclusion 
about the potential benefit of a candidate 
therapy. </p>

<p>Results 
Study selection 
The search identified 594 studies, among 
which 122 were duplicates (Fig. 1). Titles 
and abstracts of the obtained articles were </p>

<p>assessed for relevancy by two researchers 
independently (M-Y, HR-A). Any disa-
greements were resolved by consensus or 
discussion with the authors. After screening 
the titles and abstracts, 17 studies were de-
termined as eligible (BM-MNC transplanta-
tion, in which the standard neurological 
outcome had been reported). The full texts 
of the relevant articles were checked for 
eligibility criteria after investigating the full 
reports, and consequently nine studies were 
excluded. Finally, eight studies with a total 
number of 337 participants were evaluated 
to find the outcome of BM-MNC transplant 
in patients with SCI (Table 1) (12-17). 
Moreover, seven studies were included in 
the meta-analysis. 
With respect to the quality assessment, all 
clinical trials had a high risk of bias; specif-
ically, seven of eight studies were non-
randomized. Moreover, the details of ran-
domization methods were unclear in the 
remaining studies. Since it is difficult to </p>

<p>blind therapists to use stem cell transplant, 
none of the clinical trials reported alloca-
tion concealment or blinding. With regards 
to the incomplete data, all trials had a low 
risk of bias. Overall, two out of 337 pa-
tients failed to participate in the follow-up 
durations. </p>

<p>Meta analysis 
We ended up with eight studies in the 
systematic review, one of which was ex-
cluded from our analysis because of 100% 
improvement (No variation) (13). The re-</p>

<p>maining studies had a combined total of 
328 patients. Our findings revealed a con-
siderable heterogeneity among these studies 
(X </p>

results of the meta-analysis using a random

CI = (0.268, 0.589)) for the proportion of 
the improvement which was statistically 
significant (p&lt;0.0001). Although the meta-
analysis in the subgroups of patients with 
BM-MNCs transplantation in ASIA-B at 
baseline resulted in homogeneity between 
the studies, a considerable heterogeneity </p>

line (41%) was more than ASIA scale B 
(37%) (Table 2). Considerable differences

groups of ASIA-A and ASIA-B might have </p>

<p>led to this result because the likelihood of 
improvement in patients with incomplete 
impairment should be more than the com-
plete functional impairment (19). In addi-
tion, there was homogeneity between the 
studies that included patients with ASIA-B 
at baseline in contrast with studies that in-
cluded ASIA -A at baseline (Figs. 3, 4). In </p>

<p>comparison with the cervical and lumbar 
segment, cell transplantation in a thoracic 
segment might be less likely to affect a sig-
nificant outcome. However, the potential 
risk of adverse effects which may result 
from the manipulation of cervical and lum-
bar spinal cord regions is higher. Therefore, 
a potential trial should weigh the ad-</p>

<p>vantages and risks of treating cervical ver-
sus thoracic injuries (18). Thoracic cases 
were included for safety concerns in most 
of phase I/II trials. The result of the meta-
analysis revealed a considerable heteroge-
neity in both groups (Figs. 6, 7). In addi-
tion, improvement in ASIA scale occurred 
in the patients with thoracic level (50%) 
more than cervical level (43%) (Table 2), 
and this may be due to the higher number 
of thoracic cases in this review. To assess 
the potentially beneficial effects of experi-
mental treatments in SCI trials, mean 
changes in motor and sensory scores can be 
a more reliable efficacy index than the con-
version of ASIA scale (21). In our review, 
just three out of eight studies (10, 14, 16)  reported the details of ASIA motor and 
sensory scores. Although the percentage of 
patients with improved ASIA scores were 
10% in one of these studies (16), the pooled 
mean change of motor, light touch and Pin-
prick scores in patients of this study signif-
icantly increased after intervention (Table 
3). Another clinical trial assessed the quali-
ty of life score as Barthel Index. Geffner et 
al. (14) investigated different routes of 
transplant directly into the spinal cord, the 
spinal canal and intravenously and ob-
served improvements in Barthel Index of 
all the patients. Considering the fact that 
the quality of life assessment in spinal cord 
injury is significant, it might be helpful to 
use this tool as a secondary outcome 
(19).The authors suggest that quality of life 
assessment be considered as a generic out-
come for SCI cell transplantation trials. On-
ly in one clinical trial a control group was 
included. In this trial, the intervention 
group demonstrated more improvement in 
ASIA scale than the control group. Yoon 
and colleagues (17) regarded 13 patients 
treated with conventional decompression 
and fusion surgery as the control group. In 
this trial, 20 % of the treatment group and 7 </p>

<p>% of the control patients indicated an im-
proved 
neurological 
function. 
Co-
administration of granulocyte macrophage-
colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has 
been applied in two studies. Yoon et al. 
(17) stated that the administration of GM-
CSF for SCI patients may result in the pro-
gress of neurologic functions without any 
adverse effect. Recently, several research-
ers revealed that GM-CSF stimulates mi-
croglial cells to produce neurotrophic cyto-
kines such as BDNF (22). In addition, Park 
and colleagues (20) believed that GM-CSF 
enhances the activity of the patients' bone 
marrow and increases the number of BM 
derived stem cells in the circulating periph-
eral blood. However, GM-CSF administra-
tion induced fever, pain and leukocytosis in 
this trial. Regarding dynamic pathophysio-
logical and multifactorial nature of SCI and 
its consequences, the success of future cell 
therapy might likely depend on the in-
formed co-administration of combinatorial 
stem cell transplantation, pharmacological 
and rehabilitation therapies (4). This review 
demonstrated that BM-MNCs transplanta-
tion is a relatively safe intervention without 
serious adverse events. In comparison with 
mesenchymal stem cells or other cell types, 
BM-MNCs can be easily obtained and iso-
lated in a short time just before transplanta-
tion and do not require in vitro expansion. 
This reduces processing costs and minimiz-
es the risks of contamination (23). 
There were many restrictions in drawing 
a certain conclusion on the outcome of 
BM-MNCs transplantation in this review. 
As clinical trial in stem cell therapy is a 
new method and there is no sufficient liter-
ature on stem cell therapy due to the ethical 
issues and other limitations, we did not 
consider quality assessment and publication 
bias of the included studies in this analysis. 
The included trials in this review did not 
consider control groups or blinded assess-</p>

<p>ments, and this might have led to an over-
estimation of the overall outcome (24). 
Although the quality assessment of the trial 
tools presented good correlation, the results 
of one study which evaluated the impact of 
quality assessment in the meta-analysis 
showed that in systematic reviews with the 
same direction of effect, the quality as-
sessment may not significantly change the 
results (25). Since most of the included 
studies in this review demonstrated some 
degrees of improvement, waiving the quali-
ty of trials may not cause significant 
changes. </p>

<p>Conclusion 
BM-MNCs transplantation in spinal cord 
injury seems to be feasible, safe and have a 
good degree of outcome improvement. Alt-
hough most of the studies showed promis-
ing results, more qualified randomized con-
trolled trials should be conducted to exam-
ine the efficacy and appropriate dosage of 
BM-MNCs for patients with spinal cord 
injuries. </p>

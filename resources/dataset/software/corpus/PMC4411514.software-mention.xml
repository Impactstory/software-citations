<p>Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common causative agent of 
genital ulceration and can lead to subsequent neurological 
disease in some cases. Here, using a genital infection model, 
we tested the efficacy of vinegar-processed flos of Daphne 
genkwa (vp-genkwa) to modulate vaginal inflammation 
caused by HSV-1 infection. Our data revealed that treatment 
with optimal doses of vp-genkwa after, but not before, HSV-1 
infection provided enhanced resistance against HSV-1 in-
fection, as corroborated by reduced mortality and clinical 
signs. Consistent with these results, treatment with vp-gen-
kwa after HSV-1 infection reduced viral replication in the 
vaginal tract. Furthermore, somewhat intriguingly, treatment 
of vp-genkwa after HSV-1 infection increased the frequency 
and absolute number of CD3 </p>

(NK) cells producing interferon (IFN)-γ and granyzme B, 
which indicates that vp-genkwa treatment induces the acti-
vation of NK cells. Supportively, secreted IFN-γ was de-
tected at an increased level in vaginal lavages of mice treat-
ed with vp-genkwa after HSV-1 infection. These results in-
dicate that enhanced resistance to HSV-1 infection by treat-
ment with vp-genkwa is associated with NK cell activation. 
Therefore, our data provide a valuable insight into the use of 
vp-genkwa to control clinical severity in HSV infection 
through NK cell activation.

Approximately 48∼72 h after infection, a culture of host cells

<p>Animal infection </p>

<p>The mice were treated with progesterone to synchronize their 
estrous cycles (31) prior to intravaginal (i.vag.) infection with 
the HSV-1 McKrae strain. Briefly, BALB/c mice were injected 
subcutaneously (s.c.) with Depo-Provera (DP) (Upjohn Co., 
Kalamazoo, MI, USA) at 2 mg per mouse. Five days following 
DP injection, the mice were i.vag. infected with 10 
6 PFU of </p>

<p>HSV-1 McKrae strain (20 μl) per mouse. The infected mice 
were examined daily for vaginal inflammation, neurological 
illness, and death, as described previously (31). They were 
scored from 1 to 5 depending on clinical disease severity (0, 
no inflammation; 1, mild inflammation; 2, moderate in-
flammation; 3, severe inflammation; 4, paralysis; 5, death). </p>

<p>Viral titration in vaginal lavages </p>

<p>Vaginal lavage fluid was obtained by introducing 100 μl of

<p>C until 
used. Individual subsamples (50 μl from each sample) were 
further diluted, and viral titers were determined by a plaque 
assay performed on Vero cells as described elsewhere (31). </p>

<p>FACS analysis of NK cell activity </p>

<p>The mice were treated with vp-genkwa before and after 
HSV-1 infection, and the splenocytes were prepared from in-
fected mice 3 days post-infection (dpi). NK cells were enum-
erated by FACS staining using a cocktail of CD3 (145-2C11), 
NK1.1 (PK136), and NKp46 (29A1.4.9) antibodies 
(eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). To determine the activity 
of NK cells, we used intracellular staining for IFN-γ and gran-
zyme B (GrB) in response to stimulation of PMA (750 ng/ml; 
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) plus ionomycin (50 
ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, prepared splenocytes were </p>

<p>cultured with PMA and ionomycin in the presence of mon-
ensin (2 μM; Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h for IFN-γ and 4 h for 
GrB. Cells were harvested and labeled with CD3, NK1.1, and 
NKp46 antibodies, and subsequently stained with intracellular 
IFN-γ and GrB after fixation and permeabilization. All sam-
ples were acquired on FACS Calibur (BD Bioscience, 
Mountain View, CA, USA), and analyzed by <rs id="software-0" type="software">FlowJo</rs> software 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">ver. 7.6.5</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Tree Star</rs>, San Carlos, CA, USA). Forward scatter 
and side scatter were used to identify lymphocytes, which 
were further used to define NK cell and intracellular ex-
pression of IFN-γ and GrB. </p>

<p>Determination of vaginal IFN-γ secretion </p>

<p>Vaginal lavage fluid for IFN-γ secretion was collected 3 dpi 
by introducing 100 μl of PBS (pH 7.2) into the vaginal canal 
and then recovering it with a micropipette following infection 
of synchronized mice with the HSV-1 McKrae strain. The vag-
inal mucus was subsequently removed from the fluid by cen-
trifugation at 10,000 rpm for 1 min. IFN-γ levels in vaginal 
lavages were determined by ELISA using IFN-γ anti-mouse 
Ab (R4-6A2) and biotinylated IFN-γ Ab (XMG1.2). The ELISA 
plates were washed and incubated with peroxidase-con-
jugated streptavidin for 1 h, and then the color was 
developed. The IFN-γ concentration was calculated with an 
automated ELISA reader. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis </p>

<p>All data were expressed as the average±standard deviation, 
and statistically significant differences between groups were 
analyzed by unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test. Kaplan-
Meier survival curves were analyzed by the log-rank test. A 
p-value≤0.05 was considered significant. All data were ana-
lyzed using <rs id="software-1" type="software">Prism</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">GraphPadPrism4</rs>, San Diego, CA,

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>Reduction of mortality and clinical signs by treatment 
of vp-genkwa after HSV-1 infection </p>

<p>In order to assess the effect of vp-genkwa on the mortality 
and clinical signs associated with mucosal HSV-1 infection, 
we orally administered 10 and 50 mg/kg (mpk) vp-genkwa 
twice prior to HSV-1 infection. Subsequently, we examined 
infected mice daily until 15 dpi. Our results revealed that 
pre-treatment of vp-genkwa had no effect on mortality and 
clinical signs, compared to the group treated with vehicle </p>

vp-genkwa treatment prior to HSV-1 
infection. Groups of BALB/c mice 
received oral vp-genkwa twice, and 
were infected i.vag. with HSV-1 the 
next day. The infected mice were 
then examined daily until 15 dpi for 
survival (A) and for vaginal inflam-
mation, neurological illness, and 
death (B). (C and D) Effect of 
vp-genkwa treatment after HSV-1 
infection. Groups of BALB/c mice 
were infected i.vag. with HSV-1 and 
treated orally with vp-genkwa twice 
with a 1-day interval. The infected 
mice were examined daily until 15 
dpi to assess survival (C), and 
vaginal inflammation, neurological 
illness, and death (D). Kaplan-Meiers 
survival curves were computed and 
analyzed using the chi-square test. 
Clinical severity was graded as 
follows: 0, no inflammation; 1, mild 
inflammation; 2, moderate swelling; 
3, severe inflammation; 4, paralysis; 
5, death. The graph of clinical scores 
represents the average clinical score 
of 10 mice per group. </p>

<p>(Fig. 1A and B). However, somewhat intriguingly, mice that 
were treated with vp-genkwa (10 mpk) after HSV-1 infection 
showed enhanced resistance (p=0.0605), as well as alleviated 
clinical signs, compared to mice that received vehicle (Fig. 
1C and D). Furthermore, higher doses of vp-genkwa (50 
mpk) did not provide increased protection against mucosal 
HSV-1 infection, indicating that enhanced protective immunity 
against HSV-1 infection may be achieved with treatment of 
vp-genkwa at optimal doses after infection. Therefore, these 
results suggest that treatment of vp-genkwa at an optimal 
dose after HSV-1 infection provides enhanced protection, </p>

<p>while pre-treatment of vp-genkwa before HSV-1 infection 
does not affect the associated mortality and clinical signs. </p>

<p>Treatment of vp-genkwa reduces viral burden 
following HSV-1 infection </p>

<p>Because treatment of vp-genkwa (10 mpk) after infection of-
fered increased protection against mucosal HSV-1 infection, 
we examined viral secretion in vaginal lavages of mice that 
received vp-genkwa (10 mpk) before and after HSV-1 
infection. Consistent with the previous results, vp-genkwa 
treatment before HSV-1 infection showed no regulatory role </p>

vp-genkwa treatment after HSV-1 infection reduced viral titers

vp-genkwa treatment after HSV-1 infection might control 
HSV-1 replication in the vaginal tract. </p>

<p>Increased NK cell activity in vp-genkwa-treated 
mice following HSV-1 infection </p>

<p>Vaginal infiltration of innate leukocytes, such as granulocytes 
and monocytes/macrophages, are thought to contribute to 
HSV infection resistance via direct and indirect mechanisms 
(10,11). Moreover, NK cells reportedly play a crucial role in 
regulating vaginal inflammation caused by HSV-1 infection 
(4,5). Thus, we decided to explore the regulatory role of 
vp-genkwa treatment on NK cell activity. First, we determined 
the frequency and absolute number of CD3 </p>

<p>NK cells in the spleen of mice treated with vp-genkwa before 
and after HSV-1 infection 3 dpi. In spite of vp-genkwa treat-
ment before and after HSV-1 infection, our results did not in-
dicate any changes in the frequency or absolute number of 
NK cells, except that vp-genkwa treatment before HSV-1 in-
fection slightly increased the percentage of NK cells in the 
spleen (Fig. 3A). However, intriguingly, vp-genkwa treatment 
after HSV-1 infection increased the frequency and absolute 
number of IFN-γ-and granzyme B-producing NK cells, 
whereas pre-treatment with vp-genkwa before HSV-1 in-
fection did not affect the frequency or absolute number of 
IFN-γ-and granzyme B-producing NK cells (Fig. 3B and C). </p>

<p>These data indicate that vp-genkwa treatment after HSV-1 in-
fection increases NK cell activity because IFN-γ and gran-
zyme B expressed on activated NK cells are involved in erad-
icating virions and killing virus-infected cells. Supportively, 
secreted IFN-γ was detected at higher levels in vaginal lav-
ages of mice treated with vp-genkwa after HSV-1 infection, 
compared to that of mice treated with vehicle and vp-genkwa 
before HSV-1 infection (Fig. 4). Collectively, these results in-
dicate that the enhanced resistance of mice treated with 
vp-genkwa after HSV-1 infection is closely associated with in-
creased NK cell activity. </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>Examination of genital HSV infection using a murine model 
has significantly contributed to our understanding of the role 
of innate and adaptive immune cells during vaginal in-
flammation and CNS-invasion. In the present study, we dem-
onstrated using a murine infection model that treatment with 
vp-genkwa at optimal doses after, but not before, HSV-1 in-
fection provides enhanced resistance, as reflected by reduced 
mortality and clinical severity. Further, the reduction in viral 
secretion in vaginal lavages of mice treated with vp-genkwa 
after infection supported the observed decrease in the clinical 
signs caused by mucosal HSV-1 infection. Interestingly, the 
reduction in mortality and clinical signs in mice treated with 
vp-genkwa after viral infection was closely associated with 
enhanced NK cell activation, which indicates the involvement </p>

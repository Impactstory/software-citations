Treatment with vp-genkwa 
after HSV-1 infection reduces viral 
replication. (A) Effect of vp-genkwa 
pretreatment on HSV-1 replication. 
(B) Effect of vp-genkwa post-
treatment on HSV-1 replication. 
Groups of BALB/c mice (n=5) were 
infected i.vag. with HSV-1 after (A) 
and before (B) oral administration of 
vp-genkwa (10 mpk). Viral titers in 
vaginal lavages collected at 2 and 4 
dpi were determined by plaque 
assay. </p>

<p>in the control of viral secretion in vaginal lavages, whereas 
vp-genkwa treatment after HSV-1 infection reduced viral titers 
in vaginal lavages (Fig. 2). Thus, this result indicates that 
vp-genkwa treatment after HSV-1 infection might control 
HSV-1 replication in the vaginal tract. </p>

<p>Increased NK cell activity in vp-genkwa-treated 
mice following HSV-1 infection </p>

<p>Vaginal infiltration of innate leukocytes, such as granulocytes 
and monocytes/macrophages, are thought to contribute to 
HSV infection resistance via direct and indirect mechanisms 
(10,11). Moreover, NK cells reportedly play a crucial role in 
regulating vaginal inflammation caused by HSV-1 infection 
(4,5). Thus, we decided to explore the regulatory role of 
vp-genkwa treatment on NK cell activity. First, we determined 
the frequency and absolute number of CD3 </p>

<p>NK cells in the spleen of mice treated with vp-genkwa before 
and after HSV-1 infection 3 dpi. In spite of vp-genkwa treat-
ment before and after HSV-1 infection, our results did not in-
dicate any changes in the frequency or absolute number of 
NK cells, except that vp-genkwa treatment before HSV-1 in-
fection slightly increased the percentage of NK cells in the 
spleen (Fig. 3A). However, intriguingly, vp-genkwa treatment 
after HSV-1 infection increased the frequency and absolute 
number of IFN-γ-and granzyme B-producing NK cells, 
whereas pre-treatment with vp-genkwa before HSV-1 in-
fection did not affect the frequency or absolute number of 
IFN-γ-and granzyme B-producing NK cells (Fig. 3B and C). </p>

<p>These data indicate that vp-genkwa treatment after HSV-1 in-
fection increases NK cell activity because IFN-γ and gran-
zyme B expressed on activated NK cells are involved in erad-
icating virions and killing virus-infected cells. Supportively, 
secreted IFN-γ was detected at higher levels in vaginal lav-
ages of mice treated with vp-genkwa after HSV-1 infection, 
compared to that of mice treated with vehicle and vp-genkwa 
before HSV-1 infection (Fig. 4). Collectively, these results in-
dicate that the enhanced resistance of mice treated with 
vp-genkwa after HSV-1 infection is closely associated with in-
creased NK cell activity. </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>Examination of genital HSV infection using a murine model 
has significantly contributed to our understanding of the role 
of innate and adaptive immune cells during vaginal in-
flammation and CNS-invasion. In the present study, we dem-
onstrated using a murine infection model that treatment with 
vp-genkwa at optimal doses after, but not before, HSV-1 in-
fection provides enhanced resistance, as reflected by reduced 
mortality and clinical severity. Further, the reduction in viral 
secretion in vaginal lavages of mice treated with vp-genkwa 
after infection supported the observed decrease in the clinical 
signs caused by mucosal HSV-1 infection. Interestingly, the 
reduction in mortality and clinical signs in mice treated with 
vp-genkwa after viral infection was closely associated with 
enhanced NK cell activation, which indicates the involvement </p>

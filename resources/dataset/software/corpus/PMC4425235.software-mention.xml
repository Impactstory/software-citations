<p>Purpose: Although many hospitals promote self-management to chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) patients post discharge from hospital, the clinical effectiveness of this is 
unknown. We undertook a systematic review of the evidence as part of a Health Technology 
Assessment review. 
Methods: A comprehensive search strategy with no language restrictions was conducted 
across relevant databases from inception to May 2012. Randomized controlled trials of patients 
with COPD, recently discharged from hospital after an acute exacerbation and comparing a 
self-management intervention with control, usual care or other intervention were included. 
Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were undertaken by two reviewers 
independently. 
Results: Of 13,559 citations, 836 full texts were reviewed with nine randomized controlled 
trials finally included in quantitative syntheses. Interventions were heterogeneous. Five trials 
assessed highly supported multi-component interventions and four trials were less supported 
with fewer contacts with health care professionals and mainly home-based interventions. 
Total sample size was 1,466 (range 33-464 per trial) with length of follow-up 2-12 months. 
Trials varied in quality; poor patient follow-up and poor reporting was common. No evidence 
of effect in favor of self-management support was observed for all-cause mortality (pooled 
hazard ratio =1.07; 95% confidence interval [0.74 to 1.55]; I </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>=0.0%, [n=5 trials]). No clear 
evidence of effect on all-cause hospital admissions was observed (hazard ratio 0.88 [0.61, 1.27] 
I 
2 =66.0%). Improvements in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire score were seen in favor </p>

<p>of self-management interventions (mean difference =3.84 [1.29 to 6.40]; I </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>=14.6%), although 
patient follow-up rates were low. 
Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence to support self-management interventions post-
discharge. There is a need for good quality primary research to identify effective approaches. 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive and non-reversible 
lung disease characterized by breathlessness and chronic productive cough. 
1 Many 
patients suffer exacerbations requiring hospital admission, at high cost to the health 
care system worldwide and contributing to poorer prognosis for patients. </p>

<p>1   Approximately 30% of patients admitted to hospital for an exacerbation of COPD 
are readmitted within 3 months following discharge 
2 and thus form a particularly 
high-risk group with significant potential to benefit. A recent systematic review has 
shown that supported self-management interventions can be effective in reducing </p>

<p>future respiratory admissions among stable COPD patients, </p>

<p>3 </p>

<p>although simple self-management education without sup-
port is not effective. 
4 Some hospitals already promote self-
management to patients as a component of discharge care 
after admission for severe exacerbation, 
5 but it is not yet clear 
whether it is effective at this time point. 
Self-management for patients with COPD is complex 
and challenging. 
6 It requires patients to be able to manage 
various facets of their condition on a daily basis, including 
understanding and taking their medications appropriately 
with good inhaler technique, early recognition of exacerba-
tions of symptoms and early instigation of treatment during 
an exacerbation, receiving annual influenza vaccinations, 
managing their breathlessness (including stress management/ 
relaxation) to allow them to undertake activities of daily liv-
ing, bronchial clearance techniques, taking regular exercise 
to maintain their lung function and exercise capacity, quit-
ting smoking, and maintaining a healthy diet. 
7-9 In reality, 
the true extent to which patients manage these aspects is not 
well described, but likely to be sub-optimal. Patients report 
being able to recognize the onset of exacerbations with both 
clinically-recognized and experiential symptoms and signs, 
and that they wanted to self-manage, but did not always want 
to take antibiotics or steroids and might delay contacting 
health care professionals until in a crisis. </p>

<p>10   Self-management support for COPD is less well devel-
oped than in other long-term conditions. A variety of tools 
are available, such as the "Living well with COPD" program 
developed by the Montreal Chest Institute, which was first 
shown to be effective in 2003, 
11 but no one consistent recom-
mended approach. 
12 Furthermore, there is considerable over-
lap between programs which are defined as self-management 
and other more complex supervised programs such pulmo-
nary rehabilitation, integrated care or case management. 
A continuum of support is now recognized which should 
ideally be personalized to reflect an individual patient's 
needs, including disease severity and other co-morbidities. </p>

<p>9,13   Exacerbations result in marked increases in both physical 
and emotional distress for patients, taking several weeks to 
recover from. 
14 Therefore interventions effective in a stable 
state may not be appropriate after patients have recently 
experienced an exacerbation. 
We therefore report a systematic review undertaken to 
assess the clinical effectiveness of interventions to support 
self-management among patients with COPD who have 
recently been discharged from hospital following an acute 
exacerbation. Self-management is not universally defined, 
however for the purposes of this review, self-management </p>

<p>is defined as the "ability of a patient to deal with all that 
a chronic disease entails, including symptoms, treatment, 
physical and social consequences and lifestyle changes", </p>

<p>15   and we therefore included interventions which supported any 
component of self-management, comparing against usual 
care, control or other self-management intervention. </p>

<p>Methods </p>

<p>This was a protocol driven systematic review registered with 
PROSPERO (reference number CRD42011001588), and 
undertaken as part of a wider Health Technology Assess-
ment (HTA) review. </p>

<p>search strategy </p>

<p>The following databases were searched from inception to 
May 2012 with no language restrictions: MEDLINE (Ovid), 
MEDLINE In Process (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), Cochrane 
(Wiley) Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 
Science Citation Index (ISI), PEDro physiotherapy evidence 
database, PsycINFO (Ovid), and the Cochrane Airways spe-
cialized register. Search terms for respiratory disorders such 
as "COPD" and "pulmonary emphysema" were combined 
with terms for self-management and post-discharge manage-
ment such as "self management", "action planning", and 
"discharge planning" in a sensitive search strategy. Citation 
lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews 
were scanned. </p>

<p>study selection </p>

<p>Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and 
full texts of any relevant papers using pre-defined inclusion 
and exclusion criteria. We sought randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) which recruited patients with moderate to 
severe COPD (defined clinically Â± spirometry), at the point of 
discharge or within 6 weeks following hospitalization for an 
acute exacerbation of COPD. Any self-management interven-
tions were eligible which included one or more components 
commonly included in self-management interventions, such 
as action plans, exercise, education, inhaler technique, bron-
chial hygiene and breathing techniques, stress management 
and relaxation, nutritional programs, patient empowerment, 
support groups and telecare (Table S1), provided in either 
hospital or community setting with a usual care, control, 
sham intervention or other self-management intervention 
comparator. Primary outcomes of interest were health service 
utilization (primary care consultations, hospital admissions/ 
re-admissions, duration of admissions, emergency depart-
ment [ED] visits) and mortality. Any studies with important </p>

<p>systematic review: COPD self-management post discharge </p>

<p>relevant secondary outcomes such as exacerbations, health 
related quality of life (HRQoL), anxiety, depression, dyspnea, 
self-efficacy, lung function, and specific behaviors such as 
exercise/physical activity were also included. 
Studies were excluded if the patient population was mixed 
unless approximately 90% of the total sample had COPD or 
data for COPD were presented and analyzed separately. 
Trials of pulmonary rehabilitation were excluded as 
the effects of early pulmonary rehabilitation have been 
reviewed previously. 
16 Trials of smoking cessation alone 
were also excluded as smoking cessation has established 
clinical effectiveness. Interventions based exclusively on 
case-management, integrated care, disease management and 
hospital at home were excluded unless components of self-
management were part of the intervention. </p>

<p>Data extraction and assessment of risk 
of bias </p>

<p>Data extraction and quality assessment were independently 
undertaken by two reviewers with a third reviewer overseeing 
and resolving any disagreements. Quality assessment was 
undertaken using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. </p>

<p>17   Data synthesis </p>

<p>Interventions were placed into natural groupings decided 
before inspection of the results and agreed with clinical 
experts: 
1. more supported (six or more contacts, or 6 or more weeks 
in duration), 
2. less supported (fewer than six contacts or fewer than 
6 weeks in duration). 
Meta-analyses were performed using a random effects 
model where studies were judged appropriately homoge-
neous. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 
2 statistic. All 
continuous data were presented using a mean difference with 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) and time to event outcomes 
were presented as hazard ratios (HRs) to account for varying 
lengths of follow-up. Follow-up time was converted to weeks. 
The results of the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire 
(SGRQ) were multiplied by -1 so that positive differences 
equated to improved HRQoL. Where HRs were not reported, 
methods by Parmar et al 
18 and Perneger 
19 were used. Rates 
of admissions and ED visits (ie, where patients could have 
multiple events) were calculated under the assumption that 
all patients in both arms were followed up for the duration 
of the study and that the rates were constant over time. All 
data analyses were undertaken using <rs id="software-0" type="software">STATA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">12</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">StataCorp</rs> 
LP, College Station, TX, USA). </p>

<p>Results 
search results </p>

<p>Of 13,559 identified records, 836 full papers were retrieved 
and ten RCTs (including one cluster RCT) 
20 reported in 
12 papers met the final inclusion criteria (Figure 1). </p>

<p>20-31   However, one included trial of 46 patients 
21,22 reported an 
exercise-only intervention which was more similar in nature 
to pulmonary rehabilitation and quite different to the other 
studies; therefore after consideration was not reported in 
any of the outcome analyses below (see Table S2 for full 
details). </p>

<p>Characteristics of included trials </p>

<p>The remaining nine RCTs ranged in size from 33 
25 to 464 </p>

<p>23   participants (Tables 1 and S2). One paper 
27 referred to the 
Spanish center of a European study. 
24 Participants were 
recruited in hospital during an exacerbation of COPD or 
at (or immediately after) discharge. All studies were set 
among patients living at home except for the cluster RCT 
in nursing homes. </p>

<p>20   Inclusion was usually based on a clinical diagnosis of 
COPD, except the most recent study which also required 
patients to meet spirometric criteria for airflow obstruction. </p>

<p>23   One study included a mixed population of patients with 
chronic lung disease. </p>

<p>30   Mean age of participants was similar across the included 
RCTs (67-75 years), except in the trial set in nursing homes 
where the mean age was approximately 80 years. 
20 Sex dis-
tribution was variable across studies (37% to 97% males). 
Where reported, severity of disease was consistent with mean 
forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) ranging from 
approximately 31% to 42% of predicted values. Most patients 
were described as having moderate or severe COPD. 
Interventions were varied and all contained several self-
management components. All were compared against usual care 
(Tables 1 and S2, Figure 2). Five trials were classified as more 
supported, with several face-to-face visits and interventions last-
ing 6 weeks or more, and follow-up for 6-12 months. </p>

<p>20,23-25,27,30   The largest and most recent trial was described as a supported 
self-management intervention, and used the "Living Well with 
COPD" program, a comprehensive 12 months education and 
behavior-change package with motivation and support by nurses 
trained in self-regulation theory, and including medications to 
commence at the onset of an exacerbation. 
23 Two other trials 
had a similar level of support and similar interventions to each 
other: a 12 months trial of integrated care 
24,27 and a 6 months 
trial of community nurse-support. 
30 One other trial comprised 
several visits to an outpatient respiratory nurse/chest physician </p>

<p>over 6 months, 
25 and the final trial in the "most-supported" 
category provided care and support to both patients and staff 
of nursing homes. </p>

<p>20   Four trials had fewer contacts and 2-3 months follow-up. 
These interventions included two trials of home-based self-man-
agement visits 
28,29 covering a comprehensive range of components; 
case-management with telephone follow-up 
26 and a telephone-
based intervention to help patients manage dyspnea. </p>

<p>31   All interventions had at least two components and most 
were multi-component. All included training on medication </p>

<p>adherence; five trials inhaler technique, five trials smoking 
cessation, six trials nutritional advice, seven trials promoted 
exercise, and four trials management of dyspnea. Five tri-
als discussed early recognition of exacerbations but only 
one trial provided patients with medications to self-treat 
exacerbations. 
23 Only two trials cited behavior change 
theories upon which the interventions were based. 
23,31 Most 
interventions commenced after discharge although three 
trials included a review of needs and brief initial education 
session before discharge. </p>

<p>risk of bias </p>

<p>The quality of reporting and conduct of the included studies 
was often low, especially among the smaller, older studies 
(Table S3). Appropriate methods of randomization were used 
in six trials, although methods were unclear in the remain-
ing three. 
20,25,28 Allocation concealment was insufficiently 
described in all except the most recent trial. </p>

<p>23   Blinding was not common for self-management 
interventions therefore many patient-reported outcomes such 
as quality of life were subject to high risk of detection bias. 
Health care utilization outcomes, eg, hospital admissions and 
mortality related data were judged less likely to be affected. </p>

<p>Reporting and analyses of results was unclear or 
incorrect in four of the older trials. 
20,25,26,29 The clustering 
was not accounted for in the analysis of the cluster trial, </p>

<p>20   which, although having small numbers of patients per 
cluster, would possibly underestimate the uncertainty in 
the effect size. 
The most obvious flaw was the lack of completeness in 
follow-up for clinical measures and especially self-reported 
questionnaire outcomes, which was considerably less 
than 70% in some trial arms. 
23,25 One trial gave no table of 
characteristics, 
15 thus weakening ability to assess baseline 
imbalance. </p>

<p>Primary outcomes </p>

<p>Mortality 
Five trials contributed mortality data to the analysis 
(Figure 3). 
23,24,28-30 There was a wide range of event rates 
across the trials. Despite the general heterogeneity of inter-
ventions, there was no statistical heterogeneity and overall no 
evidence of effect on all-cause mortality (HR 1.07 [95% CI 
0.74, 1.55]. (I </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>=0.0%). Only one trial reported COPD-specific 
mortality therefore this outcome could not be explored. </p>

<p>23   hospital admissions 
There were six trials with data which could be combined 
to assess the overall effect on time to first admission 
(Figure 4). 
23-25,28-30 These were all-cause admissions except for 
the most recent trial which provided COPD-specific admis-
sions. Overall, statistical heterogeneity was high (I </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>=66.0%), 
and sub-dividing by level of support explained little of this. 
One of the studies which may have contributed to the remain-
ing heterogeneity in the non-exercise-based studies is the 
small study of 33 participants by Dheda et al 
25 which was 
poorly reported, had signs of inadequate randomization, and 
very high loss-to-follow-up, especially in the intervention 
arm. This study had the most extreme results in its category. 
The remaining studies were overall of moderate-good quality. 
Overall there was no clear evidence of effect (HR 0.88 [0.61, 
1.27]). A similar general lack of effect was observed when 
evaluating hospital admission rates (Figure S1) (five trials). </p>

<p>eD visits and general practitioner consultations 
Four trials reported mean ED visits per patient 
20,29-31 and two 
reported first visit. 
28,29 Although two of the three shorter tri-
als suggested potential reduction in ED visits, the two trials 
with a longer follow-up of 6 months failed to demonstrate 
any evidence of an effect (Figure S2). 
20,30 Similarly, no 
differences were observed in physician contacts reported 
between self-management interventions and usual care 
(Table 2). </p>

<p>24,28   secondary outcomes </p>

<p>Exacerbations were inadequately reported. 
25 Five trials 
measured HRQoL using two different scales. 
23,25,27,29 Self-
management interventions resulted in an improvement of 
3.84 points (95% CI 1.29, 6.40) on the SGRQ scale com-
pared with control (Figure 5); however follow-up ranged 
from ~25% to 83% across studies therefore this finding 
should be treated with caution. The small study showing the 
most extreme results suffered from poor reporting and likely </p>

<p>bias. 
25 No overall effect was observed among trials reporting 
the EuroQol 5D, a generic quality of life tool (Figure S3). 
Although there were data on less than half of the sample, 
in one trial the intervention group had a mean reduction of 
1.06 points (95% CI 0.04, 2.08) in the Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Score anxiety score, 
23 and another trial demon-
strated a mean reduction of 1.5 points (95% CI 0.62, 2.38) in 
the Anxiety and Insomnia component of the General Health 
Questionnaire relative to control (Table 2). 
20 This trial also 
showed a reduction in depression score (mean difference -1.0 
[-1.97, -0.03]), although follow-up rates were not reported 
and the CIs may be underestimated as adjustment for 
clustering was not possible. 
20 There was no evidence of such 
effect in the larger trial. </p>

<p>23   Exercise capacity was assessed in the trial of nurse-
supported discharge in Hong Kong where exercise pre-
scribed by the physiotherapist was encouraged as part of the 
intervention. 
30 Having retained nearly 90% of participants, 
it reported no difference after 6 months (mean difference 
in 6 minute walk distance 24 m [95% CI -7.1, 55.1 m]), </p>

<p>20   although the substantial baseline imbalance was not taken 
into account. 
No evidence of effect on dyspnea was observed in 
the only trial (of integrated care) which evaluated it. 
27 No 
evidence of improvement in lung function was observed 
in any of the trials. 
20,27,29 Three trials reported significantly 
better knowledge and ability to recognize and treat exac-
erbations among patients receiving the self-management 
intervention, 
27-29 although results were inconsistent for 
reported self-efficacy (Table 3). 
23,31 Two trials reported sig-
nificantly better adherence to inhaler treatment and inhaler 
technique; 
27,29 however, this was not matched by improve-
ments in smoking behaviors or uptake of vaccines. Effects 
on physical activity were inconsistent. </p>

<p>27,29 </p>

<p>Discussion 
Key results </p>

<p>Despite a rigorous search we only identified ten RCTs </p>

<p>20-31   which evaluated the effectiveness of interventions pro-
viding self-management support to patients shortly after 
discharge from hospital with an acute exacerbation of their 
COPD, and one of these was better classified as pulmonary 
rehabilitation. 
21,22 Few of the trials had consistently low risk of 
bias. Some older studies in particular were small and suffered 
from inadequate reporting and high loss-to-follow-up, particu-
larly affecting patient-reported outcomes such as HRQoL. 
There was no apparent evidence of effect of 
self-management interventions on all-cause mortality. </p>

<p>For all-cause hospital admission, although the direction of 
effect weakly favored the self-management intervention, 
there was substantial uncertainty and thus no clear evidence 
of an effect. Despite sub-dividing by the level of support 
provided in the intervention, we were unable to explain 
the heterogeneity observed. It is possible however, that 
the effects on re-admissions would be diluted because we 
extracted admissions due to any cause (although where 
reported the majority were for respiratory causes). 
In terms of health outcomes, the most consistent effects 
were observed on patients' quality of life, with an overall 
improvement of 3.8 points in the SGRQ score (close to the 
minimally clinically important difference of four points). </p>

<p>32   This estimate should however be treated with caution because 
although it is unlikely to be due to chance, there were substan-
tial and differential losses-to-follow-up between intervention 
and usual care which could bias the results in favor of a posi-
tive effect. Indeed, the authors of the largest trial indicated 
that the results from their trial could be unreliable. 
23 The 
reduction in anxiety exhibited in two trials supports some pos-
sible improvements up to 1 year, although the effect observed 
was small and should be treated with caution. </p>

<p>20,23   Overall, although knowledge about COPD improved and 
patients reported better adherence to medications and more 
effective use of inhalers, there was limited evidence of effect 
on health related behaviors or on self-efficacy. </p>

<p>How this fits into other literature </p>

<p>This systematic review addresses the effectiveness of self-
management support provided to COPD patients soon after 
hospital discharge. 
The majority of the studies and reviews of self-man-
agement support are set among patients who have COPD 
in a stable state. A systematic review of self-management 
interventions showed a reduction in respiratory admissions 
(odds ratio [OR] 0.57 [0.43, 0.75] [n=9 trials]), 
3 although no 
significant effect on all-cause admissions (OR 0.77 [0.45, 
1.30]), or on all-cause mortality (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.58 to 
1.07); but a mean improvement of 3.51 (1.65, 5.37) points 
on the SGRQ score (n=10 trials). A review of integrated dis-
ease management found a similar improvement in HRQoL: 
SGRQ 3.71 points (1.6, 5.8) (n=13); chronic respiratory 
disease questionnaire 1.02 (0.67, 1.36) (n=4) and respiratory 
admissions (OR 0.68 [0.47, 0.99] [n=7]), and a similar lack 
of effect on mortality. 
33 Conversely, a review of action plans 
alone found little evidence of benefit on HRQoL or health care 
utilization. 
4 Our results generally showed weaker evidence of 
effects on all-cause admissions and mortality, although the 
lower bound of CIs from our review are consistent with their 
results. We did not have sufficient data to measure effects on 
respiratory admissions or effects of action plans alone. The 
effect we observed on HRQoL however, was very similar to 
these reviews. </p>

<p>systematic review: COPD self-management post discharge </p>

<p>Recently, and particularly since the completion of our 
searches there has been a number of individual trials and 
commentaries which question whether patients are actually 
able to self-manage, or whether it is indeed safe. 
23,34-36 Two 
of these trials among COPD patients identified a group of 
successful self-managers in post hoc exploratory analyses 
which did better, 
23,34 but as only one of these is included in our 
review, 
23 and no other studies have explored these subgroups, 
we were unable to examine whether successful self-managers 
had better outcomes. There is no evidence from our review 
that the interventions are not safe. </p>

<p>strengths and weaknesses </p>

<p>The strength of this review was the rigorous methodologi-
cal approach with a comprehensive search and selection 
process which made it unlikely that we would have missed 
relevant studies. 
The main limitation relates to the paucity of evidence 
and methodological weaknesses of many of the available 
studies, and the heterogeneous interventions which makes 
comparisons hard and conclusions difficult to draw. The 
particular problems with these studies, especially the older 
ones include generally inadequate reporting of important 
items. Many studies were small, with data reported only 
for participants completing the trial and had substantial 
loss-to-follow-up of more than 30% in some arms, which 
is likely to bias all self-reported items and HRQoL in par-
ticular. Inability to blind subjects to interventions leaves 
the self-reported results such as HRQoL open to potential 
bias. There was a lack of information about the assessment 
of some outcomes, especially lung function measurements 
and analyses were often unclear or inappropriate. Outcome 
measures, eg, admissions, were often reported in different 
ways, making combined meta-analyses of all the available 
studies inappropriate. Neither admission nor mortality data 
were specific to COPD and therefore any effect is most likely 
to be diluted. 
With the limited number of trials it was not possible 
to assess publication bias, but it is possible that due to the 
small size of the studies showing positive effects that this is 
a potential problem. </p>

<p>Implications for research and practice </p>

<p>It is difficult to recommend any type of self-management 
support to be provided immediately after discharge as there 
is no clear evidence of effect across most of the outcomes. 
This conclusion is in contradiction to the current recom-
mendations for self-management provision in the UK </p>

<p>COPD discharge care bundle, which has been of much 
interest recently. 
5 However, the lower bounds of the CIs 
are consistent with positive effects on both mortality and 
re-admissions, and it may also be the lack of specificity in 
the cause of these two important outcomes which failed to 
demonstrate a significant effect. 
In this subject area, many of the trials are inadequately 
reported and suffer from high risk of bias in at least one 
domain. Any future trials should ensure an adequate standard 
of reporting, and be conducted to modern standards, with an 
adequate number of participants and longer follow-up. There 
should be a clear framework for describing and classifying 
self-management interventions and their comparators, and 
clear reporting of outcomes to include self-efficacy, behavior 
change (including whether patients do self-medicate appropri-
ately during exacerbations) and clinical outcomes, including 
separate reporting of COPD-related and all-cause admissions. 
Trials should also report robust effect estimates for the param-
eters needed for cost-effectiveness analyses. Future studies 
should also consider that patients may be too ill immediately 
after an exacerbation (both physically and psychologically) 
to take up the more rigorous parts of self-management inter-
ventions until they are in a more stable state. The difficulty 
in recruitment and retention in the included studies bears this 
out. Only one recent trial really addresses current issues and 
is well-designed and reported. 
23 No difference was found in 
COPD admissions or death (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.38), 
but a sub-group of patients who became "successful self-
managers" had better outcomes. 
To move forward with this area of research, there should 
be more in-depth work to explore the needs and views of 
patients with regard to self-management support after a recent 
discharge from hospital, with a view to designing novel, 
perhaps more tailored interventions. We are aware of only 
limited qualitative research of relevance. </p>

<p>14,26   Evidence from a Cochrane review of pulmonary rehabilita-
tion trials suggests that a more intensive intervention post-hos-
pitalization including a supervised exercise component reduces 
hospital admissions (pooled OR 0.22 [95% CI 0.08 to 0.58]), 
over 25 weeks and mortality (OR 0.28; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.84) over 
107 weeks. 
16 The small exercise study we decided not to pursue 
formed part of that review. 
21,22 Effects on HRQoL were well 
above the minimal clinically important difference. However, 
in common with our review, trials were small, at high risk of 
bias, and a large proportion of participants did not complete the 
rehabilitation. There was also significant heterogeneity across 
many of the outcomes. Interestingly, a more recent robustly per-
formed trial of remotely supervised home rehabilitation showed </p>

<p>no beneficial effects 
37 and there are well documented problems 
with low referral, uptake and completion rates. </p>

<p>38   Conclusion </p>

<p>General heterogeneity between interventions limits conclu-
sions for many of the outcomes. Self-management support 
delivered shortly after an acute exacerbation shows an 
apparent benefit to patients' HRQoL, although this may be 
overestimated due to high loss-to-follow-up, but there is no 
evidence of effect on all-cause hospital re-admissions, insuf-
ficient information on the effect on respiratory re-admissions, 
no effect on all-cause mortality, and limited information 
about the effect on behavior change. The evidence is not 
currently adequate to support self-management interventions 
for COPD patients recently after hospital discharge. </p>

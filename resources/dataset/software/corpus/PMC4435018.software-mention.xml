<p>). Briefly, 20 µL of plasma plus three 
drops of chase buffer were placed on the pad of the dipstick, and; ii) In 
house immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) was performed following 
a standard method using 10 µL of 2 x 10 7 L. infantum promastigotes/ 
mL in 1x PBS per well as antigen (reference strain MHOM/FR/78/ 
LEM-75) and serial two-fold dilutions of plasma for the analysis 3 . The </p>

<p>IFAT threshold title for positivity was 1/160. From 209 surveyed dogs, 
13 (6.22%) were seropositive by IFI (13/209) and/or by ICT (12/209). </p>

<p>Lymph node samples were washed with 500 µL of PBS and DNA 
was extracted by conventional phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol 
precipitation 7 , and further eluted in 100 µL sterile distilled water. Purified 
DNA was stored at -80 o C until further use. Parasite DNA detection was 
done by means of PCR targeting the Leishmania intergenic transcript 
spacer (ITS-1) 10 . Amplicons were visualized in seven out of 209 
dogs. A total of 15 (7.17%) dogs were positive by serological and/or 
parasitological methods. </p>

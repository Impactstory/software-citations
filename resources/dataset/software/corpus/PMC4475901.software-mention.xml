equilibration solution containing 3% iodoacetamide. SDS-PAGE 
was carried out using the Protean II system (Bio-Rad). For each 
sample, two 12% (v/v) polyacrylamide gels were performed in 
parallel: one for total protein stains with Coomassie Brilliant Blue 
G-250 (Bio-Rad) for further mass spectrometry analysis; and the 
other with derivatized protein residues for electrotransfer onto 
nitrocellulose membranes, where total amount of proteins were 
stained by a Fast Green solution (Sigma-Aldrich) prior to anti-
bodies incubation for loading control. Membranes were then 
blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR) overnight at 4 °C. 
Primary anti-DNP antibodies (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich) were in-
cubated for 1 h at RT. Revelation was done by a fluorescent anti-
rabbit IgG 800CW (1:15,000) polyclonal antibody (LI-COR). 
Washing steps were done with a PBS/0.1% Tween solution. Car-

<p>Results and discussion </p>

<p>Initial screening looking at changes at the global proteome le-
vel of carbonylated proteins was performed after derivatization of 
protein carbonyls with DNPH followed by immunodetection of 
DNP protein adducts after SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). Densitometry ana-
lysis was performed and normalized by total protein content for 
each sample (Fig. 1B and C). No significant differences at the global 
level in protein carbonyl content was detected between groups, in 
agreement with what was previously reported by Marzani et al. 
who did not find a statistical difference on protein carbonyl con-
tent during ageing in both rectus abdominis and vastus lateralis 
human muscles [18]. More recently, Fanò et al., using skeletal 
muscle biopsy samples obtained from vastus lateralis, found that 
protein carbonyls, showed a significant increase during ageing. 
However, this difference was not significant after splitting by 
gender [27]. Importantly, immunodetection of carbonylated pro-
teins after one-dimensional (1D) electrophoresis separation has </p>

<p>serious limitations for the resolution of single protein bands and 
can provide only restricted information. 
To further analyze the occurrence of protein carbonylation at 
the single protein level, 2D gel electrophoresis separation of pro-
tein extracts was performed prior to immunodetection of carbo-
nylated proteins. 2D gels are very appropriate to investigate pro-
tein isoforms since many post-translational modifications (such as 
carbonylation of arginine or lysine residues) often leads to changes 
in the isoelectric point of proteins, and thus shift the position of 
the protein in 2D gels. After electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose 
membranes total protein profiles were obtained by fast-green 
staining (Fig. 2). All the analyzed samples displayed a similar 
protein migration pattern, suggesting no drastic shifts in the 
protein profiles at the expression level (Fig. 2, right panels) be-
tween the two experimental groups. Immunodetection of carbo-
nylated proteins was performed after their derivatization by DNPH 
as described in Material and methods. Interestingly, the pattern of 
the modified proteins was not superimposable with the pattern 
obtained for the total protein staining, indicating that certain 
proteins represent preferential targets for these deleterious oxi-
dative modifications. Several proteins of high molecular weight 
were found preferentially carbonylated (Fig. 2, left panel) while 
certain proteins with an isoelectric point higher than 5, also ap-
peared to be preferentially carbonylated. 
A relative modification index (RMI) per spot was calculated in 
order to evidence differentially carbonylated proteins between the 
two experimental groups taking into account their protein ex-
pression levels. Seventeen protein spots exhibited an RMI ratio 
consistently higher than 1.3 (increasingly carbonylated) in all 
biopsies from the aged group as compared with the young one. On 
the other hand, fourteen protein spots showed decreased carbo-
nylation in the old group (RMI o0.7). Protein spots evidenced as </p>

<p>Fig. 2. Oxi-proteome analysis of young and old human skeletal muscle samples. Protein extracts from young (n ¼3) and old (n¼ 3) human skeletal muscle biopsies were 
separated by 2D gel electrophoresis. After the second dimension, gels were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for subsequent immune detection of DPNH-
derivatized carbonylated proteins (left panels). Densitometry analysis was done by image Master 2D software (GE Healthcare) using total protein staining (right panels) as 
loading control. </p>

increasingly carbonylated were excised from Coomassie Blue 
stained 2D gels (Fig. 3) and analyzed by MS/MS for protein iden-
tification. Protein spots that were identified in the aged group are 
listed in Table 2. Among the identified proteins, 8 are muscle 
specific, 4 are ubiquitous in different tissues and organ systems, 
and 2 proteins belong from plasma (Table 2). 
The identified skeletal muscle proteins were then analyzed and 
grouped by metabolic pathways and cellular functions. Major 
biological functions include muscle contraction, energy transduc-
tion and energy metabolism (Fig. 4). Among proteins involved in 
muscle contraction, we have found that myosin 7, troponin T, 
myosin-binding protein C (MyBPC), and LIM domain-binding 
protein 3 (ZASP) are increasingly carbonylated in aged muscle. 
Interestingly, the decreased speed of contraction observed in old 
age at both the muscle and motor protein levels is a hallmark of 
skeletal muscle ageing [28-31]. Myosin is a highly conserved 
protein that converts chemical energy into mechanical force and a 
key protein for muscle contraction. Previous studies have shown 
increased glycation of myosin in both fiber types of aged rats [32]. 
In addition, the carbonylated residues have been identified [33]. 
Interactions of myosin with cytoskeletal proteins such as titin, 
myomesin/M protein and MyBPC play an important role in thick 
filaments physiology. MyBPC contributes to the assembly and 
stabilization of thick filaments and modulates the formation of 
actomyosin cross-bridges, via direct interactions with both thick 
myosin and thin actin filaments [34,35]. The importance of MyBPC 
to muscle contraction is further emphasized by the discovery that 
mutations in genes encoding MyBPC cause myopathies in both 
skeletal [36,37] and cardiac muscles [38-40]. Increased oxidation 
of MyBPC, together with the previously reported age-dependent 
decrease of myosin isoforms and regulatory proteins like myosin 
binding proteins C and H [41-44], may contribute to the destabi-
lization of muscle fibers. In addition, perturbations in the thin 
sarcomere fillaments of muscle fibers have also been associated 
with differently expression of actin and its regulatory proteins 
such as troponin and tropomyosin [42,43,45,46]. Here we found </p>

<p>increased carbonylation levels of troponin T in the elderly. Tro-
ponin inhibits the actomyosin Mg 2 þ -ATPase and the Ca 2 þ release 
from the sarcoplasmic reticulum inducing a change in the tropo-
nin-tropomyosin conformation that exposes myosin binding sites 
on the actin filament and activates the myosin ATPase, thereby 
allowing muscle contraction [47,48]. Since muscle contraction 
depends on myofibrillar thin filament interactions [49], the oxi-
dative damage to these proteins may well compromise this in-
teraction and hence muscle contraction. 
The motor functions of striated muscle crucially depend on the 
highly ordered arrays of thick myosin and thin actin filaments in 
sarcomeres. Although its detailed role has not been elucidated yet, 
the LIM domain-binding protein 3 (ZASP), found as increasingly 
carbonylated in aged rectus abdominis muscle, functions as an 
adapter to couple protein kinase C-mediated signaling to the cy-
toskeleton and to maintain Z-disc stability as well as cytoskeletal 
ultrastructure during contraction. Accumulation of this protein in 
its oxidized form may lead to protein aggregates formation and 
myofibril disintegration that may result in muscle weakness. 
Muscle contraction depends also in high-energy fluxes where 
creatine kinase plays a central role. During muscle contraction, 
myosin hydrolyzes ATP into ADP upon filament sliding. The re-
newal of ATP is achieved mainly by the phosphocreatine-creatine 
kinase (PCr-CK) system. Among the creatine kinase (CK) iso-
enzymes, the muscle-type CK (MM-CK) specifically binds to the 
myofibril M-line and is associated with the action-activated 
myosin ATPase as an intramyofibrillar ATP regenerator [50-52]. 
Since this MM-CK was found irreversibly oxidized in old rectus 
abdominis muscle, this could alter muscle metabolism and com-
promise muscle contraction in the elderly. Besides the PCr-CK 
system, the glycolytic network and its closer interaction between 
mitochondria and organelles also provide energy within muscle 
cells [53]. In this study, 3 glycolytic enzymes appear as highly 
carbonylated in old slow oxidative skeletal rectus abdominis mus-
cle: the fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A, the glycerol-3-phos-
phate dehydrogenase (GPD1) and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate 
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Table 2). Interestingly, several of these 
enzymes involved in anaerobic metabolism have been found de-
creased with age in murine and human skeletal muscle [54,55]. 
Although slow skeletal muscles uses mainly oxidative mi-
tochondrial processes to generate the levels of ATP needed to 
maintain contractile activity for long time without showing fatigue 
[53], they also rely in glycolysis for their energy production [56]. 
For this reason, muscle metabolism and contraction in aged ske-
letal muscle would be affected by irreversible carbonylation on 
glycolytic proteins, as previously reported in certain diseases when 
these glycolytic enzymes are not functional [57-62]. Defects in the 
muscle form of glycogen phosphorylase, another protein found 
increased carbonylated in old rectus abdominis muscle, are in-
volved in type 5 glycogen storage disease, also known as McArdle 
disease, a myopathy also characterized by exercise intolerance, 
such as easy fatigability, muscle cramps and contractures as well 
as muscle weakness [63,64]. Intramuscular glycogen acts as a 
readily available source of glucose-6-phosphate for glycolysis 
within skeletal muscle and glycogen phosphorylase catalyses the 
rate-limiting step in glycogenolysis [65]. Therefore, a deficiency in 
glycogen phosphorylase may result in the inability to mobilize 
muscle glycogen during anaerobic metabolism [66]. 
Although it is well recognized that ageing causes changes in the 
proteome, the nature and targets of these changes, their con-
sequences on skeletal muscle function and how they may con-
tribute to sarcopenia have not yet been completely elucidated. Our 
results suggest that oxidative stress during skeletal muscle ageing 
targets the contractile machinery, but also structural and reg-
ulatory proteins. In addition, the main mechanism of energy pro-
duction, the phosphocreatine kinase system was affected by </p>

positions of the 17 selected spots identified by MS/MS correspond to those found as

carbonylation in the elderly while other energetic metabolic 
pathways such as glycolysis appear to be also affected. Finally, the 
heat shock 70 kDa protein (HSP70), a key player in protein quality 
control with different identified roles in skeletal muscle [67], such 
as protection against oxidative stress, was also found highly car-
bonylated in old skeletal muscle. Up-regulation of heat shock 
proteins is a well know feature of muscle ageing [46,68,69]. Fur-
ther studies should address the functional status of the identified 
carbonylated proteins and related cellular pathways associated </p>

<p>with muscle dysfunction in order to reveal their role in the de-
velopment of the ageing phenotype. </p>

<p>measured 2 h after a standard 75 g glucose load(2-h 
PG). 
1 ,2 ) The cutpoint of these criteria is based mainly on </p>

<p>the prevalence of microvascular complications. However, 
FPG cutpoint of 140 mg/dL has been challenged s ince it 
defined a greater degree of hyperglycemia than did the 
cutpoint of 2-h PG(200 mg/dL). </p>

<p>3 ) </p>

<p>Recently, American 
Diabetes Association(ADA) has proposed a revised 
diagnostic criteria that lowers the FPG cutpoint to 126 
mg/dL. 
4 ) By lowering FPG cutpoint, cutpoints for the FPG </p>

<p>and 2-h PG are believed to diagnose similar conditions, 
and ADA recommends that the FPG test is greatly 
preferred in clinical settings because of ease of 
administration, convenience, acceptability to patients and 
lower cost. 
It is well established that diabetes mellitus and 
impaired glucose tolerance by WHO criteria(1985) are 
also associated with an increased risk of development of 
cardiovasular disease and form part of the metabolic 
syndrome. </p>

<p>5 ) </p>

<p>At present, it is not clear whether metabolic 
characteristics of glucose tolerance categories based on 
FPG criteria are in agreement with those of WHO 
criteria(1985) or not. Larsson et al. 
6 ) reported that the </p>

<p>subjects with IGT and IFG are comparable in terms of 
body mass index, blood pressure and serum lipids in a 
group of middle-aged Caucasian women, while Gimeno 
et al. 
7 ) showed that subjects with discordant diagnoses, </p>

<p>who had IGT or diabetes by WHO criteria but who were 
normal by ADA fasting criteria, exhibited a higher number 
of cardiovascular risk factors (higher blood pressure and 
triglyceride and low HDL cholesterol) than those who 
were discordant (IFG/diabetes) by ADA fasting criteria but 
normal by WHO criteria. 
In this study, we applied the revised ADA fasting 
criteria to data collected from a previously published 
population-based survey for diabetes in Korean 
subjects 
8 ,9 ) and compared the prevalence and metabolic </p>

<p>profile of glucose tolerance categories with those of WHO 
criteria. </p>

<p>The Yonchon Study is a population-based diabetes 
epidemiology survey in t h e Korean population. The 
study population and research design have been 
described in detail, previously. </p>

<p>8 ,9 ) </p>

<p>Subjects were classified 
according to both WHO criteria and 1997 ADA fasting 
criteria. 
S ubjects who were already using oral 
hypoglycemic agents , insulin or diet for diabetes were </p>

<p>excluded from all analyses. 
Prevalence of glucose tolerance categories were 
calculated for both sets of diagnostic criteria and to 
examine the agreement between t he two criteria, all 
categories of glucose tolerance were calculated. </p>

<p>10 ) </p>

<p>Metabolic characteristics of different glucose tolerance 
categories were compared. Differences among these 
groups were tested with analysis of variance. Statistical 
analyses were done us ing the <rs id="software-0" type="software">Statistical Packages for 
Social Science</rs>(SPSS) <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">8.0</rs> for windows. P-values &lt; 
0.05(two-tailed) were considered to be statistically 
s ignificant. </p>

<p>1. Preva le nce of glucose tolera nce categories </p>

<p>The overall prevalence of diabetes did not differ 
between t h e two criteria. Prevalence of diabetes 
according to WHO(1985) criteria was 5.15 % and that 
according to ADA(1997) fasting criteria was 5.42 %. 
However, only 64.7%(75 of 116 subjects) of those who 
were diagnosed as diabetes according to WHO criteria 
were diagnosed as diabetes by ADA fasting criteria. 19.0 
% of diabetes according to WHO criteria were reclassified 
as impaired fasting glucose(IFG) and 16.4 % as normal 
fasting glucose(NFG). S imilarly, 38.5 % of diabetic 
patients according to ADA fasting criteria were IGT or 
normal glucose tolerance(NGT) by WHO criteria(Table 1). </p>

<p>Concordant and discordant diabetes groups were older 
than concordant non-diabetes group. They showed 
higher WHR, systolic and diastolic blood press ure, 
cholesterol and triglyceride levels than concordant 
non-diabetes group (Table 2). When comparing meta-
bolic characteristics among diabetes groups, concordant 
diabetes [diabetes (WHO) / diabetes (ADA)] group 
showed higher triglyceride and lower HDL levels than 
discordant diabetes groups. Non-diabetes (WHO)/ </p>

<p>diabetes (ADA) group had higher WHR than diabetes 
(WHO)/non-diabetes(ADA) group. There were no differ-
ences in other metabolic profiles between t he two 
discordant diabetes groups. 
Table 3. showed metabolic profiles of subjects with 
impaired glucose metabolism. Concordant and discordant 
impaired glucose metabolism groups were older and had 
higher BMI, WHR, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
cholesterol and triglyceride levels than NGT/NFG group. 
IGT/IFG s ubjects showed higher WHR and triglyceride 
levels than discordant impaired glucose metabolis m 
groups(IGT/NFG, NGT/IFG). Metabolic profiles of 
IGT/NFG group were not different from those of NGT/IFG 
group, except that IGT/NFG group was older than 
NGT/IFG group. </p>

<p>D IS C US S IO N </p>

<p>The revised ADA diagnostic criteria are intended to 
reduce the discrepancy between FPG and 2-h PG 
cutpoint and to encourage the use of FPG rather than 
t h e oral glucose tolerance test to diagnose diabetes. In 
this study, the prevalence of diabetes using ADA fasting 
criteria was similar with that us ing WHO(1985) criteria. 
However, the agreement between WHO and ADA fasting 
criteria was not good. A third of the subjects who were 
diagnosed as diabetes according to WHO criteria were 
reclassified as either IFG or NFG by ADA fasting criteria. 
S imilarly 38.5 % of the s ubjects who were diagnosed as 
diabetes by ADA fasting criteria were not diagnosed as 
having diabetes according to WHO criteria. Our study 
also showed that about 2/3 of IGT subjects were 
reclassified as NFG, which is very similar to previous 
reports showing that 70-80 % of IGT subjects were 
reclassified as NFG. 
10 , 1 1) Conversely, 2/3 of IFG s ubjects </p>

<p>were NGT by WHO criteria. These results are consistent 
with the reports which showed only moderate to poor 
agreement between t he two criteria </p>

<p>13 , 14 ) </p>

<p>Poor agreement between t he two criteria raised the 
concern that a substantial number of glucose intolerant 
subjects, who have a increased risk of diabetic 
complications or increased risk of developing diabetes 
mellitus and cardiovascular disease, may be ignored 
when using ADA fasting criteria. 
Our results showed that discordant diabetes groups 
had higher WHR, blood pressure, cholesterol and 
triglyceride than the concordant non-diabetes group. 
However, 
metabolic 
characteristics 
of 
diabetes 
(WHO)/non-diabetes(ADA) group was s imilar to those of 
non-diabetes(WHO)/diabetes(ADA) group. This implies 
that when we use ADA fasting criteria to diagnose 
diabetes, we will miss a similar number of s ubjects who 
may have increased risk for diabetic complications . 
Subjects with IGT are known to have increased risk of 
developing diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. 
15 , 16 ) In </p>

<p>our population, IGT/NFG subjects had increased 
cardiovascular risk compared to NGT/NFG s ubjects. 
Although they were older than NGT/IFG subjects, other 
metabolic profiles were s imilar to those of NGT/IFG 
subjects. Thus, t he discordant impaired glucose 
metabolism group may have a similar risk for the 
development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 
These results are similar to the observation in a group of 
middle-aged Caucasian women 
6 ) while Gimeno et al.7) </p>

<p>s howed that subjects with discordant diagnoses, who had 
IGT or diabetes by WHO criteria but who were normal by 
ADA fasting criteria, exhibited a higher number of 
cardiovascular risk factors than those who were 
discordant (IFG/diabetes) by ADA fasting criteria but 
normal by WHO criteria. These results suggest that 
s ubjects with IGT who are reclassified as NFG by ADA 
fasting criteria have no less risk for development of 
diabetes and cardiovascular disease than subjects with 
NGT/IFG. 
In conclusion, ADA fasting criteria can detect a s imilar 
number of diabetic patients and impaired glucose 
metabolis m. It can pick up new subjects who are not 
classified as diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance by 
WHO criteria. However, a substantial number of subjects, 
who may have increased cardiovascular ris k and/or 
increased risk for the development of diabetes , will be 
missed when using only FPG cutpoint. Long term study 
will be needed to evaluate whether glucose tolerance 
categories classified by ADA fasting criteria will result in 
decreased morbidity and mortality, compared to those 
according to WHO criteria. </p>

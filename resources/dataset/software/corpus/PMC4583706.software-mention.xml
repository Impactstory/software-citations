<p>from patients diagnosed and treated at Hospital Sant Joan de Déu 
(Barcelona, Spain) were included in the study. Normal fetal brain 
(n = 2) and adrenal gland (n = 2) tissues as well as ganglioneuroma 
samples (n = 2) were used as reference samples. Neuroblastoma 
risk assessment was defined by the International Neuroblastoma 
Staging System (INSS) [8]. Patients' clinical and biological character-
istics are displayed in Table 1. Tumors were evaluated by a patholo-
gist, only samples with more than 70% viable tumor cell content 
were included in the study. This study was approved by the Institu-
tional Review Boards. Informed consent was obtained before collec-
tion of samples. 
Genomic DNA was isolated from samples using Wizard DNA Purifi-
cation Kit (Promega Biotech Ibérica, Spain), following manufactures' 
protocols. </p>

<p>3.2. DNA methylation microarrays </p>

<p>Genomic DNA bisulfite conversion and hybridization to Infinium 
Human Methylation 450k BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) was 
performed at the Human Genotyping Unit of the Spanish National Can-
cer Center (CEGEN-CNIO, Madrid, Spain), as described previously [9]. </p>

<p>3.3. Quality control </p>

<p>Microarray data was analyzed by <rs type="software">minfi</rs> [10] and <rs type="software">shinyMethyl</rs> [11] 
packages available through <rs type="software">Bioconductor</rs> [12]. </p>

<p>Single cytosine methylation values (β-values) in each sample were 
calculated as the ratio of the methylated signal intensity to the sum of 
methylated and unmethylated signals. Methylation values ranged 
from 0, fully unmethylated, to 1, fully methylated cytosine. Raw methyl-
ation β-value plots were performed for all samples to identify possible 
deviant samples (Fig. 1 &amp; B). 
Sample quality was assessed using the log median intensity in both 
the methylated and unmethylated channels (Fig. 1C). 
Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the 20,000 
most variable autosomal probes in order to analyze associations be-
tween sample type (adrenal gland, ganglioneuroma, fetal brain or neu-
roblastoma) and methylation levels (Fig. 2). </p>

<p>3.4. Data normalization </p>

<p>Microarray methylation data was normalized by <rs type="software">missMethyl</rs> pack-
age [13] using the SWAN (subset-quantile within array normalization), 
a within-array normalization method for Illumina Human Methylation 
450k BeadChips (Fig. 3). </p>

<p>3.5. Filtering of microarray data </p>

<p>An optimized pipeline with several filters developed at the IDIBAPS 
was used to exclude technical biases, [14,15]. Cytosines with poor detec-
tion P-values (P N 0.01) and those with sex-specific DNA methylation 
(n = 6926) were removed from the initial dataset of 485,512 sites (ex-
cluding probes detecting SNPs). The remaining sites (n = 478,169) 
were used for downstream analyses (Fig. 4). </p>

<p>3.6. Bisulfite pyrosequencing </p>

<p>DNA methylation data were validated by bisulfite pyrosequencing as 
previously described [15,16] (Fig. 5). </p>

<p>4. Data summary </p>

<p>The analysis of the DNA methylome of neuroblastoma patients re-
vealed that: i) most DNA methylation changes take place outside pro-
moters, ii) not only CpGs but also non-CpG sites are targeted, iii) 
methylation changes at these sites are associated with clinicopatholog-
ical features of neuroblastoma, and iv) the identified epigenetic patterns 
provide new insights into the pathogenesis and clinical behavior of this 
pediatric tumor. The analysis of this data has been reported in our re-
cently published study [15]. </p>

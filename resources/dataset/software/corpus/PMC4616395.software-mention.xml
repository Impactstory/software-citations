<p>Abstract: Inflammation is highly prevalent among peritoneal dialysis </p>

<p>(PD) patients. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is the most 
widely used inflammatory marker in clinical medicine and is correlated 
with mortality in PD patients. Air pollution is associated with systemic 
inflammation. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the 
role of air pollutants and other clinical variables on hs-CRP values in PD 
patients. 
We recruited a total of 175 patients who had been undergoing 
continuous ambulatory PD or automated PD for at least 4 months and 
regularly followed up. Air pollution levels were recorded by a network 
of 27 monitoring stations near or in the patients' living areas throughout 
Taiwan. The 12-month average concentrations of particulate matter 
(PM) with an aerodynamic diameter of &lt;10 and &lt;2.5 mm (PM 10 and 
PM 2.5 ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), carbon monoxide 
(CO), and ozone (O 3 ) were included. 
In stepwise linear regression, after adjustment for related factors, 
white blood cell count (b: 0.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.71, 
2.11]) and CO level (b: 0.17, 95% CI [2.5, 21.32]) were positively 
associated with hs-CRP and serum albumin levels (b: À0.25, 95% CI 
[À13.69, À3.96]) and normalized protein nitrogen appearance 
(b: À0.18, 95% CI [À17.7, À2.51]) was negatively associated with 
hs-CRP. However, serum indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate levels 
were not significantly associated with hs-CRP (P &gt; 0.05). 
In PD patients, the environmental CO level was positively correlated 
with hs-CRP level. </p>

<p>T </p>

<p>he prevalence of inflammation among peritoneal dialysis 
(PD) patients is high. Inflammation is a powerful predictor 
of mortality and cardiovascular death in patients with end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD). The causes of inflammation in PD 
patients are complex and multifactorial, including factors 
related or unrelated to dialysis. 
1 The dialysis-related factors 
causing chronic inflammation in PD patients include peritoneal 
catheter use, glucose in the dialysate, peritonitis, exit-site 
infection, and endotoxins/cytokines from the dialysate; those 
factors unrelated to dialysis include loss of residual renal 
function, 
2-5 accumulation of uremic toxins, other comorbid-
ities, malnutrition, or other infections. 
1 Chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) may act as a potent stimulus of inflammation. 
6,7 Protein-
bound uremic toxins such as p-cresyl sulfate (PCS) and indoxyl 
sulfate (IS) are associated with atherosclerosis and endothelial 
dysfunction, and activation of atherosclerotic proinflammatory 
markers. 
8-11 C-reactive protein (CRP) is the most widely used 
inflammatory marker in clinical medicine. A change in residual 
kidney function has also been associated with an increase in 
CRP in PD patients. 
12 Several other studies reported a similar 
association between increased CRP level and increased 
mortality in both hemodialysis 
13,14 and PD patients. </p>

<p>3,15-17   Interestingly, several studies have revealed that air pollution 
is associated with systemic inflammation. 
18-20 The 6 most 
common air pollutants are particulate matter (PM), lead (Pb), 
sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen oxides (NO x ), ozone (O 3 ), and 
carbon monoxide (CO). 
21 Poor air quality has a profound and 
lasting effect on human health, particularly on the respiratory, 
cardiovascular, 
22,23 and central nervous systems. 
24-26 In a 
recent study, chronic CO exposure was associated with arterial 
wall thickness and an elevated level of high-sensitivity CRP (hs-
CRP). 
27 To our knowledge, few studies have investigated air 
pollution as a dialysis-unrelated factor causing chronic inflam-
mation in PD patients. The aim of this prospective cross-
sectional study was to assess the role of air pollutants and other 
clinical variables on hs-CRP values in PD patients. </p>

primary data were collected according to the Strengthening the 
Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. </p>

<p>Study Population </p>

<p>Initially, we randomly recruited a total of 175 patients who 
had been undergoing continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) or 
automated PD (APD) for at least 4 months and regularly 
followed up at a PD center in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. 
All patients were randomly recruited between October 1 and 
November 30, 2009. Patients with a history of dialysis-related 
infection or other types of active infections within 3 months 
before study inclusion were excluded. PD supplies (CAPD and 
APD solutions) were obtained from Baxter Healthcare SA, 
Singapore. All patients gave their informed written consent. 
Age, gender, and clinical data were obtained from the patients' 
medical records. All medical records during the study period, 
including medical history, laboratory data, and inclusion and 
exclusion factors, were reviewed by 2 nephrology specialists 
(W-HH and T-HY) and 1 general physician (M-JC). </p>

<p>Sample Collection </p>

<p>Fasting blood, urine, and dialysate samples were collected 
on the same day between October 1 and November 30, 2009 
during each patient's yearly routine examination, which 
included a peritoneal membrane function test. The plasma, 
dialysate, and urine concentrations of creatinine (Cr), serum 
albumin, and urea nitrogen were measured using routine labora-
tory methods. On the basis of the studies on the contributions of 
PCS and IS in the pathogenesis of vascular injury through 
endothelial dysfunction, 
8,10 proliferation of vascular smooth 
muscle cells, 
9 activation of atherosclerotic proinflammatory 
markers, 
11 and suppression of endothelial repair, 
28 we measured 
the serum concentrations of total formed IS and PCS for their 
correlation with the hs-CRP level. Protein nitrogen appearance 
was normalized to body weight (nPNA). Anuria was defined as 
24-hour urine volume &lt;50 cm </p>

<p>3   . Residual renal function was 
calculated as follows: (renal normalized urea nitrogen clearance 
þ renal normalized Cr clearance)/2. Owing to the lack of any 
definite hs-CRP cutoff level indicating an inflammatory state in 
PD patients, inflammation was defined as an hs-CRP level of 
!10 mg/L, a level that has been correlated with increased 
mortality risk in PD patients. 
17 Levels of the air pollutants 
were also categorized into high and low according to the median 
value of each of the 6 air pollutants. The method for testing of IS 
and PCS was referenced from a previous study. </p>

<p>29   Air Quality Status and Analysis </p>

<p>To verify our inference that levels of air pollutants are 
correlated with hs-CRP values in PD patients, we analyzed the 
database and cited the report on the air quality status in Taiwan, 
using the data from the Taiwan Air Quality Monitoring Network 
operated by the Environmental Protection Administration. 
30 We 
recorded and analyzed the difference in air quality from the 
previous 12-month average exposure concentration of air pol-
lutants according to the patients' living areas. To the best of our 
knowledge, the appropriate averaging time for the air pollution 
effect on inflammation is unclear. Previous studies showed that 
the effect is spread overall for several days, 
19,31 months, 
32 or 
even years. 
33 From the above-cited studies, we considered the 
previous 12-month average exposure concentration of air pol-
lutants for each subject's examination. The referenced items </p>

<p>included previous 12-month average concentrations of PM with 
an aerodynamic diameter of &lt;10 and &lt;2.5 mm (PM 10 and 
PM 2.5 ), SO 2 , NO 2 , CO, and O 3 . Air pollution levels were 
recorded by a network of 27 monitoring stations near or in 
the patients' living areas throughout Taiwan. The most northern 
living area is Hsichih District and the most southern area is 
Changhua City. </p>

<p>Statistical Analysis </p>

<p>The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test if vari-
ables were to be normally distributed. A P value &gt;0.05 was 
required to assume a normal distribution. Data are expressed in 
terms of median and interquartile range in nonnormal distri-
bution variables and as mean AE standard deviation in normal 
distribution variables. Comparisons between groups were per-
formed using the Mann-Whitney test and Student t test. x 
2 or 
Fisher exact tests were used to analyze the correlation between 
categorical variables. To calculate the relative correlation of the 
hs-CRP value, standardized coefficients (b) and 95% CIs were 
obtained using linear regression models. Univariate and step-
wise linear regression analyses were used. The following factors 
were investigated: PM 10 , SO 2 , NO 2 , CO, O 3 , PM 2.5 , age, PD 
duration, serum Cr level, white blood cell count (WBC), nPNA, 
serum albumin, serum total IS, serum total PCS, residual renal 
function test, intact parathyroid hormone level (iPTH), blood 
aluminum (Al) level, diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery 
disease (CAD), and hypertension. All the nominal variables in 
linear regression were transformed into dummy coding. Missing 
data was approached with listwise deletion. All statistical 
analyses were performed using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">Statistical Package for the Social Sciences</rs>, version <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version">12.0</rs> for Windows (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc</rs>, Chicago, 
IL). A P value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>Patient Characteristics </p>

<p>A total of 175 patients from a single PD center were 
enrolled in this study. Fourteen patients received APD and 
161 patients received CAPD. Table 1 lists the characteristics 
of the study subjects (mean age, 50 years). Of all patients, 125 
were women and 78 patients showed anuria. Furthermore, the 
daily exchange volume was 9.85 L. The median hs-CRP level 
was 2.8 mg/L (range, 1.2-7.6 mg/L). Fifteen patients (8.5%) 
were habitual users of tobacco. The median concentration of 
PM 10 was 49.1 mg/m </p>

<p>of CO was significantly (P ¼ 0.04) associated with a high level 
of hs-CRP (!10 mg/L); however, all the other pollutants did 
not show a significant association (P &gt; 0.05). In this study, 
75 patients lived in the area of higher level of CO and other 
100 patients lived with contrary condition. Thirty patients had 
inflammation status. Except for gender, no related clinical 
variables were different between these 2 groups (Table 3). 
To further clarify the factors associated with hs-CRP level in 
our study patients, we used univariate and multivariate linear 
regression ''stepwise'' methods, for analyses. PM 10 , SO 2 , NO 2 , 
CO, O 3 , PM 2.5 , age, PD duration, serum Cr level, WBC, nPNA, 
serum albumin level, serum total IS, serum total PCS, residual 
renal function test, iPTH, blood Al level, DM, CAD, and 
hypertension were investigated as clinical variables. Table 4 
revealed that in univariate linear regression, the environmental 
CO level (b: 0.16, 95% CI [0.91, 21.27]), blood Al level (b: 
0.16, 95% CI [0.17, 3.91]), and blood WBC (b: 0.24, 95% CI 
[0.51, 1.98]) were positively associated with hs-CRP and serum 
albumin levels (b: À0.22, 95% CI [À12.95, À2.78]), and log 
nPNA (b: À0.24, 95% CI [À50.47, À12.75]) was negatively </p>

<p>associated with hs-CRP level. Except for CO, the other air 
pollutants were not associated with hs-CRP level (P &gt; 0.05). 
Furthermore, in the ''stepwise'' model of linear regression, 
after adjustment for related factors, blood WBC (b: 0.28, 95% 
CI [0.73, 2.12]) and CO level (b: 0.17, 95% CI [2.54, 21.27]) 
were positively associated with hs-CRP and serum albumin 
levels (b: À0.25, 95% CI [À13.51, À3.93]), and log nPNA 
(b: À0.18, 95% CI [À17.25, À2.33]) was negatively associated 
with hs-CRP level. However, serum IS and PCS levels were not 
significantly associated with hs-CRP level (P &gt; 0.05). </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>In this study, we have shown that after adjustment for 
related risk factors, the level of the air pollutant CO was 
significantly positively associated with the level of the inflam-
mation marker hs-CRP in PD patients. 
It is well known that cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the 
leading cause of death in patients with ESRD, and chronic 
inflammation is a risk factor correlated with CVD. Inflam-
mation is highly prevalent in the PD population. When esti-
mated by CRP level with different cutoff values and assay 
sensitivities, the prevalence of inflammation varied between 
12% and 65%. 
34 The causes of inflammation in PD patients are 
multifactorial, 
1,35 primarily systemic infection, glucose in the 
dialysate, peritonitis, malnutrition, residual renal function, and 
accumulation uremic toxins. 
1,35 Bergstrom 
36 showed an import-
ant association between increased CRP level and increased 
mortality in hemodialysis patients. A number of other studies 
reported a similar association between increased CRP level and 
increased mortality in both hemodialysis 
13,14 and PD 
patients. 
3,15,16 Herzig et al 
15 showed in a study of 50 PD patients 
that an increased CRP level was associated with an increased 
risk of acute myocardial infarction. Wang et al 
3 also pointed out 
that an increased CRP level predicts mortality and cardiovas-
cular death independent of other clinical, cardiovascular, dialy-
sis, nutritional, and biochemical parameters. Iseki et al </p>

<p>17   reported that in a 5-year follow-up study, a CRP level of 
10 mg/L or higher was associated with a &gt;3-fold increased 
mortality in PD patients. An increased CRP level has also been </p>

<p>37   Interestingly, several studies have revealed that air pollu-
tion is associated with systemic inflammation. 
18-20 The 6 most 
common air pollutants are PM, Pb, SO 2 , NO x , O 3 , and CO. </p>

<p>21   The effects of poor air quality on human health are profound and 
lasting, and principally affect the respiratory and cardiovascular 
systems. 
22,23 In addition, air pollution has been associated with 
increased incidence of and mortality from CAD. 
38 In a large 
population and long follow-up study of 6 US cities (Harvard Six 
Cities study), 
22 a significant association was noted between air 
pollution and mortality after adjustment for smoking, particu-
larly in cities where pollutant levels were highest. An extended </p>

<p>follow-up of the Harvard Six Cities study showed that cardi-
ovascular and lung cancer mortality rates were each positively 
associated with fine particulate air pollution (PM 2.5 ). </p>

<p>39   To our knowledge, reports on the association between 
inflammation and air pollution in PD patients are limited. In 
this study, we found that the CO level is positively associated 
with the level of hs-CRP after adjustment for related risk 
factors. CO is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that is 
slightly lighter than air. It occurs in various natural and artificial 
environments. However, with increasing industrialization and 
urbanization, CO is chiefly emitted from the exhaust of internal 
combustion engines and industrial production, as well as from 
incomplete combustion of various other fuels. CO is toxic to </p>

<p>humans and animals at higher concentrations. Acute CO poi-
soning is known to occur worldwide, and its major compli-
cations involve the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. 
However, our knowledge about the effects of chronic CO 
poisoning is limited, especially in PD patients. The results of 
chronic CO exposure in human and animal studies are conflict-
ing. Many animal studies 
40-42 have shown that short-term 
and low-level CO exposure may protect against inflammatory 
and reactive oxygen-inducing stimuli. In other studies, inter-
mittent CO exposure caused damage to the arterial wall and 
resulted in atherosclerosis. 
43-45 Epidemiological studies have 
shown that high levels of environmental CO were correlated 
with CVD and mortality. 
46,47 In a recent study, Davutoglu 
et al 
27 showed that hs-CRP levels and carotid intima-media 
thickness are increased in subjects with chronic CO exposure. 
The mechanism by which chronic CO exposure increases hs-
CRP level is not clear. However, in the study by Davutoglu et al, 
one limitation is that environmental CO level and other air 
pollutants were not measured. From the above-cited studies, we 
could infer that short-term and low-level CO exposure may 
have anti-inflammatory effects in animals. However, chronic 
CO exposure may damage the arterial wall and result in 
atherosclerosis. In our study, we found that in PD patients, 
the environmental CO level was positively correlated with hs-
CRP level. This result agrees with the findings of the studies 
cited above. </p>

<p>CONCLUSION </p>

<p>In conclusion, this cross-sectional study shows that in 
patients with PD, the environmental CO level is associated 
with the level of hs-CRP. Further studies are required to clarify 
the role of environmental air pollutants in inflammation and 
related comorbidities in PD patients. </p>

<p>Limitations </p>

<p>This study has several limitations. Among them is the cross-
sectional nature of the observation and that the study group is 
predominantly represented by women. In our PD center, the 
patients themselves choose between PD and HD. Considering 
the working environment and home-care conditions, most 
women chose PD. On the contrary, according to the limitations 
in technology and information on indoor air quality, we used the 
previous 1-year average air quality published by the Environ-
mental Protection Administration Executive Yuan, Taiwan to 
represent the air quality of the patients' living areas. </p>

<p>Initially, univariate linear regression analysis was performed to identify the variables associated with hs-CRP levels in 175 patients. WBC, blood Al, 
environmental CO, albumin, and nPNA were associated with hs-CRP levels. In a further analysis with stepwise linear regression, WBC, albumin, 
nPNA, and CO were found to be associated with hs-CRP levels. Al ¼ aluminum, CAD ¼ coronary arterial disease, CCrn K ¼ normalized renal 
creatinine clearance, CI ¼ confidence interval, CO ¼ carbon monoxide, Cr ¼ creatinine, DM ¼ diabetes mellitus, hsCRP ¼ high-sensitivity C-reactive

<p>Background: The efficacy and safety of the combined treatment of refractory schizophrenia with 
antipsychotic medications and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remain uncertain. 
Aim: Conduct systematic review and meta-analysis of available literature in English and Chinese about ECT in 
the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. 
Methods: English and Chinese databases were searched for studies published prior to May 20, 2015 
regarding the efficacy and safety of the combined treatment of refractory schizophrenia with antipsychotic 
medications and ECT. Two researchers selected and evaluated studies independently using pre-defined 
criteria. <rs id="software-0" type="software">Review Manager</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">5.3</rs> software was used for data analysis. 
Results: A total of 22 randomized control studies, 18 of which were conducted in mainland China, were 
included in the analysis. Meta-analysis of data from 18 of the 22 studies with a pooled sample of 1394 
individuals found that compared to treatment with antipsychotic medications alone, combined treatment 
with antipsychotic medications and ECT had significantly higher rates of achieving study-specific criteria of 
'clinical improvement' (RR=1.25, 95%CI=1.14-1.37). Based on the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, 
Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria, the quality of evidence for this assessment of efficacy was 
'moderate'. However, the proportion of participants who experienced headache during the treatment was 
significantly higher in the combined treatment group (RR=9.10, 95%CI=3.97-20.86, based on a pooled sample 
of 517 from 8 studies) and the proportion who experienced memory impairment was also higher in the 
combined treatment group (RR=6.48, 95%CI=3.54-11.87, based on a pooled sample of 577 from 7 studies). 
The quality of evidence about these adverse events was rated as 'very low'. 
Conclusions: There are very few high quality randomized controlled clinical trials about the combination of 
antipsychotic medications and ECT in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. This meta-analysis found 
that the combination of antipsychotic medications and ECT could improve psychiatric symptoms in patients 
with refractory schizophrenia, but the incomplete methodological information provided for most of the 
studies, publication bias (favoring studies with better outcomes in the combined treatment group), and 
the low quality of evidence about adverse outcomes, cognitive impairment, and overall functioning raise 
questions about the validity of the results. </p>

<p>[2]   The difficulty of treating patients with refractory 
schizophrenia can lead to a poor quality of life for 
affected individuals. 
[3] Clozapine is considered an 
effective medicine for most patients with refractory 
schizophrenia, but another therapeutic option 
considered in several studies is the combined use of 
antipsychotic medication and electroconvulsive therapy 
(ECT). [1] However, the findings from these studies have 
been inconsistent: compared to continued use of 
standard antipsychotic medications, some studies find 
the combined use of antipsychotic medication and ECT 
beneficial, some find it no different, and some find it 
inferior due to the increased occurrence of memory 
loss and headache. 
[4] This paper reports on the first 
known systematic review and meta-analysis on this 
topic, combining studies reported both in English and in 
Chinese. </p>

<p>2. Methods </p>

<p>2.1 Search strategy 
We searched the following databases for studies 
published before May 1, 2015: Pubmed, Excerpta 
Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), The Cochrane Library, 
EBSCO, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure 
(CNKI), Chongqing VIP database for Chinese Technical 
Periodicals, WANFANG DATA, Chinese Biological Medical 
Literature Database, Taiwan Electronic Periodical 
Services, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We used the keywords 
'refractory,' 'schizophrenia,' 'psychosis,' 'electric shock,' 
'electroconvulsive,' 'clinical control study,' 'randomly, 
placebo', and 'randomly, trial' (and the Chinese 
equivalents) in the searches. Various combinations 
of these keywords were used to search for articles, 
reference lists of included articles were hand-checked 
for further relevant studies, and experts in the field 
were asked about ongoing studies. </p>

<p>2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
All reports of randomized controlled trails (RCTs) about 
the combined treatment of refractory schizophrenia 
with antipsychotic medications and ECT were screened </p>

<p>using the following inclusion criteria: a) a diagnosis 
of refractory (or 'treatment-resistant') schizophrenia 
made by psychiatrists; b) the control group was treated 
with antipsychotic medications; and c) the intervention 
group was treated with antipsychotic medication and 
ECT. Studies published in either English or Chinese 
were considered. Observational studies, anthropologic 
studies, review articles, research protocols, case reports, 
and duplicated reports were excluded. </p>

<p>2.3 Screening of articles 
All search results were imported into Endnote X5 
software. Two authors (WWZ and PCC) independently 
screened titles and abstracts after eliminating 
duplicates. The full texts of the remaining articles were 
screened according to the above inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. When the two authors disagreed about the 
inclusion of an article and were unable to agree after 
discussing the article, a third author (LCB) made the 
final determination. As shown in Figure 1, 22 studies 
were included in the final analysis. </p>

<p>2.4 Evaluation of risk of bias 
Two authors (WWZ and PCC) assessed the risk of 
bias independently for all included articles using the 
Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) 
[5] tool which considers seven 
specific items: random sequence generation; allocation 
concealment; blinding of participants and treating 
clinicians about group assignment; blinding of evaluators 
of outcomes about group assignment; incomplete data 
(attrition and exclusions); selective outcome reporting; 
and other biases (including study-specific biases or 
concerns about fraudulent results). Each aspect was 
rated as 'low risk of bias', 'high risk of bias', or 'unclear' 
(if insufficient information was provided in the article to 
make a determination). A third author's (LCB) opinion 
was sought when the two raters disagreed. 
We also evaluated the quality and level of evidence 
of each outcome variable for each of the 22 included 
studies using the Cochrane collaboration's Grades of 
Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and 
Evaluation (GRADE) software. This software assesses 
limitations of the design, consistency of results, indirect 
evidence, precision of results, publication bias, and 
effect size for each outcome. [5,6] The overall level of 
evidence is rated as 'high', 'medium', 'low', or 'very low'. </p>

<p>2.5 Outcome measures 
This meta-analysis was conducted to assess the 
efficacy and safety of the combination of antipsychotic 
medication and ECT in the treatment of patients with 
refractory schizophrenia. The primary outcome measure 
of effectiveness was the reduction in the total score 
of the main scale used to assess psychiatric symptoms 
during treatment. The primary outcome measure of 
adverse events was based on the score of the Treatment 
Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS). Secondary outcomes 
were the changes of cognitive and overall functioning 
after treatment. </p>

<p>•208 • </p>

<p>2.6 Data extraction 
For each included study, two authors (WWZ and PCC) 
independently extracted data using a pre-designed 
data extraction form including the names of authors, 
publication year, sample size, number of outcome 
events, age of participants, and types of antipsychotics 
used. Discrepancies between the two coders were 
checked by a third author (LCB). </p>

<p>2.7 Analysis 
Based on the results of a previous study about risk of 
bias, 
[25] the overall risk of bias for each of the 22 studies 
was classified as 'low' if the ratings were 'low' for all 
seven items on the ROB tool, 'unclear' if any item is 
rated as 'unclear' and all other items are rated as 'low', 
and 'high' if any of the items are rated as 'high'. The 
kappa statistic was used to measure the inter-rater 
agreement between the two independent raters for the 
ratings of each item and for the overall rating. 
[7] Review 
Manager (RevMan 5.3) was used to estimate pooled 
the mean difference (MD) when the same continuous 
measure was used as the outcome measure in all 
included studies, the standard mean difference (SMD) 
when different continuous measures were used as 
outcome measures in included studies, and risk ratios 
(RR) for outcomes that were categorical measures. </p>

<p>Heterogeneity was measured using I </p>

<p>2 </p>

<p>. 
[8] When I 
2 is less 
than 50% and p&gt;0.10, the results were considered 
homogeneous and the fixed-effect model was used; 
when I 
2 is greater than 50% but less than 75%, results 
were considered heterogeneous and the random-effect 
model was used. If I 
2 is 75% or greater, we conducted 
sensitivity analysis to identify potential contributors 
to heterogeneity; if I 
2 remained 75% or greater after 
removing outliers, we only provided descriptive results 
without pooling estimates. A funnel plot was used to 
evaluate potential publication bias. </p>

<p>[5]   3 Results </p>

<p>3.1 Characteristics of included studies 
As shown in Figure 1, we identified a total of 1065 
articles in the selected databases. After removing 166 
duplicated articles using Endnote X5 software, there 
were 899 unduplicated reports. Based on the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria, 773 articles were excluded 
by reading the title and abstract and a further 104 
were excluded by reading the full text. The remaining 
22 articles 
[9-23,26-32] were included in the subsequent 
analyses: 18 (81.8%) were from China </p>

<p>[10,12-16,18-22,26-32]   and 4 (18.2%) from other countries; 
[9,11,17,23] all were 
published between 1999 and 2015. </p>

<p>• 209 • </p>

<p>The characteristics of these 22 included studies are 
shown in Tables 1 and 2. </p>

<p>a) Definition of refractory schizophrenia: The inclusion 
and exclusion criteria varied across studies, but 
most studies used either the diagnostic criteria for 
schizophrenia established by the Chinese Society of 
Psychiatry (CCMD) [33] or the diagnostic criteria for 
schizophrenia developed by the American Psychiatric 
Association (DSM-IV), 
[34] required a duration of 
illness of at least 2 years (with one exception 
[9] ), 
and required unsatisfactory clinical results when 
previously using at least two types of antipsychotic 
medications. </p>

<p>b) Gender of participants: One study 
[32] only included 
females, but all other studies 
[9-23,26-31] included both 
males and females. </p>

<p>c) Age of participants: Three studies 
[9,17,27] did not 
describe the age of participants; the remaining 19 
studies [10-16, 18-23, 26,28-32] were conducted with adults 
ranging from 18 to 74 years of age. </p>

<p>d) Duration of illness: Among the 17 studies that 
provided the mean duration of illness among 
participants, [9,11-13,15,17-19,22,23,26-32] the range in the 
mean duration of illness was from 6 to 21 years. </p>

<p>e) Type of antipsychotic medication used in study: All 
participants received antipsychotic medications 
either alone or in combination with ECT. The 
medications employed included clozapine, 
olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, ziprasidone, 
chlorpromazine, and flupenthixol. </p>

<p>f) ECT sessions: Two studies 
[9,17] did not provide 
information on the number of ECT sessions; the 
remaining studies [10-16,18-32] reported using 6 to 24 
ECT sessions. Among the 18 studies [10-14,16,18, 20-23,26- 32] that provided information on ECT frequency, 
the range in frequency was from three sessions 
per week to two sessions per month. Only eight 
studies 
[11,12,13,17,22,23,28,31] reported on the type of ECT 
stimulus, which was either bilateral or bitemporal. </p>

<p>g) Outcome measures: Standard measures of 
psychiatric symptoms, primarily the Positive and 
Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) 
[35] and the Brief 
Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), 
[36] were used to 
assess effectiveness, though the criteria used to 
determine clinical improvement varied somewhat 
across studies. Overall adverse events were 
assessed using TESS 
[37] in six studies. </p>

<p>[10,13,18,20,28,30]   Five studies reported results of cognitive 
functioning: two studies 
[11,23] used the Mini-
Mental State Examination (MMSE), 
[41] one study </p>

<p>[18]   used the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), </p>

<p>[42]   and two studies 
[19,31] used the Wechsler Memory 
Scale (WMS). 
[43] Overall functioning was assessed 
using the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) 
[38] in three studies 
[11,18,28] and the Clinical Global 
Impression score (CGI) 
[44] in one study. </p>

<p>[17]   h) Duration of follow-up: One study 
[26] did not provide 
information about the duration of follow-up; 
one study 
[14] had a 3 to 5 week follow-up; four 
studies [17,21,27,31] followed patients for 4 weeks; nine 
studies [9,10,15,19,20,22,23,30,32] followed patients for 8 
weeks; six studies 
[12,13 16,18,28,29] followed patients for 
12 weeks; and one study 
[11] followed patients for 24 
weeks. </p>

<p>3.2 Risk of bias and publication bias 
The results of the assessment of risk of bias in the 
22 studies are shown in Table 3. Most of the studies, 
particularly those from China, did not provide sufficient 
details about the methods used in the study, so the 
majority of the assessments for the seven items 
included in the Risk of Bias (ROB) tool 
[5] were rated 
as 'uncertain'. One study 
[17] used sham ECT and, thus, 
was double-blind; two other studies 
[11,23] used blinded 
outcome evaluators; and one study 
[23] reported that the 
participants and treating clinicians were not blinded; but 
none of the other studies provided information about 
blinding of the participant, the treating clinician, or the 
outcome evaluator. Only two studies [17,18] described the 
method of randomization. Overall, one study 
[23] was 
rated as 'high' risk of bias and the other studies were all 
rated as 'uncertain' risk of bias; none of the studies were 
classified as being at low-risk of bias. The inter-rater 
reliability of the two independent coders' assessment 
of overall risk of bias in the studies was acceptable 
(kappa=0.75). 
The funnel plot of the primary outcome of efficacy 
provided by 18 of the studies [9,10,12-16,18-20,22-23,26-27,29-32] is 
shown in Figure 2. There is substantial publication bias; 
the three smaller studies [9,19,23] were more likely to find a 
significant advantage for combined treatment with ECT 
plus antipsychotic medications versus the sole use of 
antipsychotic medications in the treatment of refractory 
schizophrenia. </p>

c Weighted kappa values for inter-rater reliability of the two independent coders who assessed each item for the 23 studies </p>

<p>As shown in Table 4, based on the GRADE criteria 
the overall quality of the evidence about effectiveness 
(defined as percent of patients who showed 
'improvement' by the end of the trial) was rated as 
'moderate', but the quality of evidence about general 
side effects (assessed using TESS), cognitive functioning, 
and overall functioning was rated as 'very low'. The 
six studies that provided data about general side 
effects based on the TESS score [10,13,18,20,28,30] had very 
heterogeneous results and, thus, could not be pooled in 
a meta-analysis. </p>

<p>3.3 Efficacy </p>

<p>Eighteen studies with a pooled sample of 1394 
participants provided information on efficacy (i.e., 
percent of cases that achieved the study-specific criteria 
for 'improvement') at the end of the trial. [9,10,12-16,18-20,22- 23,26-27,29-32] The I

p-value was too small to justify considering the results 
of the various studies homogeneous (I </p>

<p>schizophrenia treated with the combination of ECT and 
antipsychotic medications are more likely to experience 
symptomatic improvement than patients treated with 
antipsychotic medications alone (RR=1.25, 95% CI =1.14-
1.37). </p>

<p>3.4 Adverse effects 
As shown in Table 5, six studies with a pooled sample 
of 534 participants reported TESS scores. [10,13,18,20,28,30]  The TESS results from these studies were quite </p>

<p>heterogeneous, so it is only possible to provide a 
descriptive assessment of the results. Using the overall 
TESS score as the measure of the severity of adverse 
events, three of the studies [18,28,30] showed no significant 
differences between the two groups, one study [13] found 
significantly more severe adverse events in the ECT plus 
antipsychotic medication group, and two studies [10,20]  found significantly more severe adverse events in the 
group that only received antipsychotic medication. </p>

<p>Thirteen studies 
[13-15,18,22,23,26-32] provided information 
about specific adverse events. As shown in Table 6, a 
total of 26 kinds of adverse events were reported. Meta-
analysis of the results identified two adverse effects 
that were reported at a significantly higher frequency 
by patients receiving combined treatment with ECT plus 
antipsychotic medication than by patients treated with 
antipsychotic medications alone: headache (based on 
a pooled sample of 517 individuals from eight studies, 
OR=9.10, 95%CI=3.97-20.86) and memory impairment 
(based on a pooled sample of 577 individuals from 
seven studies, OR=6.48, 95%CI=3.54-11.87). </p>

results, 
[11,18,19,23,31] but only four of them had data that 
could be pooled in a meta-analysis. 
[11,18,23,31] The meta-
analysis (Figure 4) comparing the standardized mean 
difference (SMD) in the final scale scores between 
groups used the total MMSE score 
[41] for the two studies 
that used MMSE, 
[11,23] the perseverative errors score 
from the WCST 
[42] for the study that used the WCST, </p>

<p>[18]   and the picture recognition score from the WMS 
[43] for 
the study that use the WMS.

that use the WCST and for the study that used the WMS </p>

<p>indicate significantly greater cognitive impairment in the 
group treated with ECT and antipsychotic medications, 
but when pooled with results from the two studies that 
use MMSE to assess cognitive functioning, the overall 
results were not significantly different between the two 
groups (SMD=-0.28, 95%CI=-0.77~0.20). However, as 
stated previously (Table 4), the quality of evidence from 
these studies was rated as 'very low'. </p>

<p>3.6 Overall function </p>

<p>The meta-analysis of the three studies 
[9,16,26] that used 
the GAF to assess overall functioning at the end of the 
trial is shown in Figure 5. (The study that employed CGI 
to assess overall functioning 
[17] could not be included 
because the report for the study did not include a 
standard deviation for the mean CGI score.) For each 
of the three studies and for the pooled result for the 
studies, the overall functioning at the end of the study </p>

<p>was significantly better in the ECT plus antipsychotic 
medication group than in the group treated with 
antipsychotic medications alone ( MD=10.25, 
95%CI=7.48-13.01). However, the quality of evidence 
for these studies was rated as 'very low' based on the 
GRADE criteria. </p>

<p>4. Discussion </p>

<p>4.1 Main findings </p>

<p>Since the operational definition of 'refractory 
schizophrenia' was first proposed by Kane in 1995, [3]  there has been increasing research about the 
identification and management of these hard-to-
treat patients. Previous meta-analyses conclude that 
clozapine can improve psychiatric symptoms and 
decrease the occurence of extrapyramidal side effects 
for about half of these refractory patients. [24] ECT is </p>

<p>an option for increasing the proportion of refractory 
patients who achieve satisfactory clinical outcomes, 
but there are few studies addressing this issue, possibly 
because of the reluctance of patients and clinicians to 
use ECT. 
Extensive screening of English-language and 
Chinese-language databases identified 22 RCTs on 
this topic, among which 4 were in English and 18 
were in Chinese, suggesting that the use of ECT as an 
adjunctive treatment in refractory schizophrenia is 
less controversial in China than abroad. The pooled 
result about efficacy (defined as the proportion of 
participants that achieved the study-specific criteria 
for 'improvement') included 1394 individuals that 
participated in 18 studies. It clearly indicated a superior 
clinical result for refractory patients who received 
combined treatment with ECT and antipsychotic 
medications (RR=1.25, 95% CI =1.14~1.37). Moreover, 
the quality of the evidence for this outcome using the 
GRADE criteria was rated as 'moderate', which means 
that the result is reasonably robust. We also found 
that patients who received combined treatment were 
much more likely to report headaches and memory 
impairment during the treatment and to have higher 
overall functioning at the end of treatment, but the 
quality of evidence for these findings was rated as 'very 
low'. </p>

<p>4.2 Limitations 
The low quality of the RCTs identified for inclusion in 
this review seriously limits the validity of the results, 
particularly the results related to the occurrence of 
adverse effects, cognitive impairment, and overall 
functioning. As shown in our assessment of the risk of 
bias, the main problem was that most of the reports 
on the included studies did not provide details about 
the methods employed in the study, resulting in an 
overall rating of the assessment of risk of bias of 
'uncertain' in 21 of the 22 included studies. </p>

<p>The most troubling problem was lack of blinding. 
Double blinding is difficult to achieve in studies involving 
ECT because of the practical and ethical problems of 
administering 'sham ECT', so it is not surprising that 
sham ECT was only used in 1 of the 22 included studies. 
On the other hand, it is relatively easy to blind raters 
who assess the outcome measures, but this was only 
done in 3 of the 22 studies. We also identified a clear 
publication bias, favoring publication of studies that find 
superior outcomes among patients receiving both ECT 
and antipsychotic medication. </p>

<p>4.3 Implication 
The current study systematically reviewed and 
evaluated all available RCTs about the efficacy and 
safety of the combined use of antipsychotics and ECT in 
the treatment of patients with refractory schizophrenia. 
Meta-analysis of the 22 identified studies found that 
compared to treatment with antipsychotic medications 
alone, combined treatment with ECT and antipsychotic 
medication resulted in improved clinical outcomes, 
higher rates of headaches and memory impairment 
during treatment, and better overall functioning at the 
end of treatment. However, given the low quality of the 
evidence in the studies and the existence of publication 
bias, these results must be considered suggestive, not 
definitive. Better designed studies that include more 
detailed description of the methods employed are 
needed to confirm (or disprove) these results. 
Studies about the use of ECT in schizophrenia 
are relatively common in China, so this is one area in 
which China could make an important contribution 
to the global literature. However, Chinese mental 
health researchers will not be able to make useful 
international contributions until they resolve common 
problems in the design and implementation of their 
studies, problems that could be easily addressed by 
strict adherence to the recommendations for RCTs in 
the CONSORT statement. </p>

<p>背景：抗精神病药物合并电抽搐治疗 (electroconvulsive </p>

<p>therapy, ECT) 对难治性精神分裂症患者的疗效和安全性 
还不确定。 </p>

<p>目的：对电抽搐治疗在难治性精神分裂症中的应用的 
相关中英文文献进行系统综述和 meta 分析。 </p>

<p>方法：在中英文数据库中检索 2015 年 5 月 20 日前发 </p>

<p>表的关于抗精神病药物合并 ECT 治疗难治性精神分裂 
症疗效和安全性的研究。由两名研究人员根据预先设 
定的标准独立筛选和评估文献。采用 Review Manager 
5.1 软件进行数据分析。 
结果：共纳入 22 项随机对照研究，其中在中国大陆 </p>

<p>开展的研究有 18 项。本研究对 22 项研究中的 18 项 
研究共 1394 例样本进行 meta 分析后发现，相比于 
单独使用抗精神病药物，抗精神病药物合并 ECT 治 
疗达到各研究特定的 " 临床改善 " 标准的比例要显著 
高 (RR=1.31, 95%CI=1.22-1.41)。根据推荐 GRADE 分级 
的评估、制定和评价标准 (Grades of Recommendation, 
Assessment, Development, and Evaluation, GRADE)， 该 
疗效评估的证据质量是"中等"。但是，在治疗过程 </p>

<p>中出现头痛的参与者比例在合并治疗组中显著更高 
(RR=9.10, 95%CI=3.97-20.86，基于 8 项研究 517 例样 
本)。合并治疗组中出现记忆受损的患者的比例也高 
(RR=6.48，95% CI=3.54-11.87， 基 于 7 项 研 究 577 例 
样本)。这些不良反应的证据质量被评定为"非常低"。 </p>

<p>结论：有关抗精神病药物合并 ECT 治疗难治性精神分 
裂症的高质量随机对照临床试验很少。该 meta 分析 
发现，抗精神病药物合并 ECT 可以改善难治性精神分 
裂症患者的精神症状，但大多数研究提供的方法学信 
息不全，存在发表偏倚(更偏向于合并治疗组结果相 
对好的研究)，有关不良反应、认知受损和整体功能 
的证据质量较低，这使我们需要对结果的效度有所质 
疑。 </p>

<p>Background: Publicly available data show variation in GPs' use of urgent suspected cancer (USC) referral pathways. We 
investigated whether this could be due to small numbers of cancer cases and random case-mix, rather than due to true variation in 
performance. </p>

<p>Methods: We analysed individual GP practice USC referral detection rates (proportion of the practice's cancer cases that are 
detected via USC) and conversion rates (proportion of the practice's USC referrals that prove to be cancer) in routinely collected 
data from GP practices in all of England (over 4 years) and northeast Scotland (over 7 years). We explored the effect of pooling 
data. We then modelled the effects of adding random case-mix to practice variation. </p>

<p>Results: Correlations between practice detection rate and conversion rate became less positive when data were aggregated over 
several years. Adding random case-mix to between-practice variation indicated that the median proportion of poorly performing 
practices correctly identified after 25 cancer cases were examined was 20% (IQR 17 to 24) and after 100 cases was 44% (IQR 40 to 47). </p>

<p>Conclusions: Much apparent variation in GPs' use of suspected cancer referral pathways can be attributed to random case-mix. 
The methods currently used to assess the quality of GP-suspected cancer referral performance, and to compare individual 
practices, are misleading. These should no longer be used, and more appropriate and robust methods should be developed. </p>

<p>Early detection and treatment of cancer is an important goal for 
health services. The United Kingdom (UK) and other countries 
with strong primary care 'gatekeeper' systems persistently display 
lower cancer survival rates when compared with other developed 
countries. This effect is widely attributed to longer intervals in 
the cancer diagnostic and treatment pathway (Richards, 2009; 
Coleman et al, 2011). 
The UK NHS has existing fast-track urgent suspected cancer 
(USC) referral pathways from primary to secondary care (NICE, 
2005; Scottish Government, 2009). In England, patients referred 
from primary care with suspected cancer should be seen in 
secondary care within 2 weeks (hence the common term '2-week 
wait referrals'; Meechan et al, 2012; Department of Health, 2000) 
and begin treatment within 62 days (England and Scotland; </p>

<p>Department of Health 2000; Scottish Executive Health 
Department, 2007). 
There is evidence that practices vary in the frequency with 
which they make USC referrals. In Scotland, an analysis of 18 775 
USC referrals in 2008 reported a six-fold variation in the use of this 
referral route (Baughan et al, 2011). Similar variation was shown in 
an analysis of 865 494 referrals in England over 1 year (Meechan 
et al, 2012). This latter analysis also found a positive correlation 
between practices' detection rate (the proportion of all cancers 
referred as USC) and conversion rate (the proportion of all USC 
referrals resulting in a cancer diagnosis; Supplementary Appendix 1). 
This correlation has been used as evidence of a quality gradient: 
with 'high-quality' practices being both more accurate (higher 
detection rate) and more efficient (higher conversion rate) in their </p>

use of USC than others (Meechan et al, 2012). In England, the 
National Cancer Intelligence Network now publishes GP practice 
profiles for cancer that include annual detection and conversion 
rates (National Cancer Intelligence Network, 2012). This has led to 
media reports of unacceptable variations in GP performance 
culminating in the recent recommendation by the UK Health 
Secretary that 'poorly performing' practices be publicly named. 
(BBC Website, 2013; BBC Website, 2014). 
Current reporting is based on referral data from a single year 
and does not distinguish between different cancer types. New cases 
of cancer are relatively uncommon in primary care, and therefore 
the number of cases in any year will be small. Furthermore, cancer 
in primary care is heterogeneous: some cancers typically present 
with features amenable to prompt recognition and referral 
(e.g., testicular cancer presenting as a lump), whereas others 
typically have nonspecific symptoms (e.g., ovarian cancer; Bottle 
et al, 2012). This is reflected in substantial differences in the use of 
the USC pathway according to cancer type (National Cancer 
Intelligence Network, 2014). Even within the same cancer type, 
some presentations will prompt urgent referral (e.g., lung cancer 
presenting with haemoptysis), whereas others may not (e.g., lung 
cancer presenting with nonspecific symptoms; Birring and Peake, 
2005). Furthermore, presymptomatic cancers that had been 
detected via national screening programmes are currently counted 
in the non-USC category, introducing a further source of variation 
in apparent GP performance. 
Current national guidelines dictate which circumstances 
warrant USC referral; thus, adherence to these will inevitably 
influence which referral route GPs choose. Thus, depending on 
case-mix, two practices following guidelines equally well may have 
different detection and conversion rates with the appearance, based 
on current metrics, that one is better than the other (Dua et al, 2009). 
The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of the number 
of cancer cases and random case-mix on the variation in GP 
performance in cancer diagnosis and their implication for public 
reporting. First, we examined the effect of aggregating data for each 
practice over several years on the proposed 'quality gradient' 
indicated by the association between detection and conversion rates. 
Second, we examined year-to-year correlation in detection and 
conversion rates in order to assess whether practices were consistent 
over time in their reported rates. Finally, we carried out a simulation 
modelling study to estimate the variation in USC rates attributable 
to random case-mix and used this to estimate the likelihood that a 
poorly performing practice would be correctly identified. </p>

<p>MATERIALS AND METHODS </p>

<p>Data sources. The current study used two databases. The first 
provided data on the route of cancer diagnosis, including USC 
referral from primary care over 7 years (2006-2012) in the NHS 
Grampian region of northeast Scotland. The second contained data 
on the route of cancer diagnosis including 2-week referrals over 
4 years (2010-2013) from NHS England. USC in Scotland and 
2-week referrals in England are the broadly equivalent referral 
routes by which GPs in Scotland and England, respectively, secure 
an urgent secondary care appointment for patients in whom a 
strong suspicion of cancer is supported by existing guidelines. 
The data from northeast Scotland comprised practice-level data 
for all GP practices in the NHS Grampian region relating to all 
cancer diagnoses and all USC referrals made between 2 January 
2006 and 30 November 2012. These were obtained from the NHS 
Grampian Cancer Care Pathway database (CCPd). The CCPd is a 
detailed clinical database maintained by NHS Grampian, recording 
information about all cancer referrals made by GPs within the 
region, as well as information about all cancer diagnoses, </p>

<p>irrespective of route of diagnosis. The start date for these data 
represents the earliest date of collection of USC referral data. The 
NHS England data comprised publicly available practice-level data 
for all GP practices on the NCIN website (National Cancer 
Intelligence Network, 2014) for the years 2010-2013 inclusive. </p>

<p>Data processing and analysis. With the NHS Grampian data, for 
each practice and year, we extracted the total number of cancers, 
the number of cancers detected after USC referral and the total 
number of USC referrals. We also used demographic data from 
each practice to calculate age-sex-standardised referral ratios based 
on the number of USC referrals that would have been expected 
from the practice relative to other practices in NHS Grampian. 
With the NHS England data, for each practice and year, we 
extracted the total number of cancers treated, the number of 
cancers detected after USC referral and the total number of USC 
referrals. We also extracted the age-sex-standardised referral rate. 
With both extracted data sets, we calculated the detection and 
conversion rates for each practice for each year and aggregated 
across years. These are analogous to the sensitivity and positive 
predictive value, respectively, of a diagnostic test: in this case, the 
'diagnostic test' is the practice GPs' decision to refer patients via 
the USC route. We used these measures because they have been 
promoted for comparison between practices and are currently 
being made publicly available (Meechan et al, 2012; National 
Cancer Intelligence Network, 2014). 
In both databases, we found that some practices had only a 
small number of cancer cases. For the NHS Grampian data set, 
data from practice-years that contained no cancers diagnosed via 
the USC pathway were included in the analysis of aggregated 
practice data but excluded from investigation of detection and 
conversion rates. In the NHS England data, where there were less 
than six cancers referred or diagnosed in a year for a practice, the 
exact number was not published; thus, the corresponding record 
from that year was excluded from all analyses. 
For each individual practice-year and for practice data 
aggregated across all years, we plotted detection and conversion 
rates as scatter plots, with lines fitted by linear and local 
polynomial regression, and calculated the correlation coefficient 
between detection and conversion rates. This followed the method 
previously used on single-year data (Meechan et al, 2012) and used 
the Spearman rank correlation coefficient with bootstrapped 
confidence interval (CI) method for both data sets. We calculated 
the mean and standard deviation of the detection and conversion 
rates for aggregate data from all practices and by three different 
case volumes of cancer diagnosis over the study periods (1-75, 
76-150 and 151-400 cases). </p>

<p>Year to year correlation. We calculated the year-to-year correlation 
of practice detection and conversion rates, using the Spearman rank 
correlation coefficient, for all pairs of adjacent years. To examine the 
effects of number of cancers on these correlations, we analysed this 
by subgroups of practices according to the number of new cancer 
cases in 1 year. </p>

<p>Simulation modelling. In order to examine the effect of random 
case-mix at practices of different sizes, we generated sets of 
simulated GP 'practices'. Within each set, we introduced three 
sources of variation in measured performance: true practice 
variation, random case-mix and practice case numbers. 
These were introduced as follows: </p>

<p>True practice variation. This represents the between-practice 
variation in performance, such as would result from differences in 
competence, population or organisation. It was introduced by 
randomly allocating each practice its own practice detection rate, 
taken from a normal distribution with the mean set at the overall 
mean detection rate from the NCIN data (0.477). The standard </p>

GP performance in referral for suspected cancer </p>

<p> 
www.bjcancer.com | DOI:10.1038/bjc.2015.110 </p>

<p>deviation for this distribution was set to one of three arbitrary 
values chosen to represent low, moderate and high true practice 
variation (0.025, 0.05 and 0.075, respectively). </p>

<p>Practice case numbers. This was introduced to examine the effect 
of different numbers of cancer cases on reported variation. We set 
practice case numbers at values of 25, 50, 75, 100, 150 and 200 
cases. For reference, an average-sized practice with B6000 patients 
can expect around 25 new cancers in a year. </p>

<p>Random case-mix. This represents the within-practice variation in 
performance resulting from the characteristics of individual cancer 
cases. It assumes that the difficulty in diagnosis lies in each case, 
such that two equally performing doctors, following guidelines, 
would vary in observed performance according to the cases they 
saw. It was introduced by having practices randomly sample their 
specified number of 'cases' from a larger pool of cases. Cases in this 
larger pool were all allocated a 'referral route' property in advance 
(either USC or other), with the proportion of USC cases set at the 
practice detection rate. As a result, the observed detection rate for 
each 'practice' represented a single sampling from a binomial 
distribution whose probability parameter was sampled from 
a Gaussian distribution. </p>

<p>Modelling procedure. We created 18 model specifications (three 
levels of between-practice variation Â six practice case numbers). 
Each specification of the model was constructed for sets of 1000 
practices and run 200 times. Within each specification, we 
recorded the minimum, maximum, mean and standard deviation 
of the detection rate within each run. We then summarised them 
by calculating the medians of these measures over all runs. 
Within each specification, we designated 'practices' whose 
practice detection rate was in the lowest decile of the distribution 
as poorly performing. After adding the effects of random case-mix, 
we recorded the number of these that were correctly identified as 
poorly performing (still in the lowest decile of the distribution). We 
also recorded the number of practices that were incorrectly 
identified as poorly performing (i.e., practice detection rate outside 
the lowest decile before introducing the case-mix, but in the lowest 
decile afterwards). For both of these measures, we reported the 
median and interquartile range across all of the runs for each 
model specification. </p>

<p>Comparison with published data. We compared the standard 
deviation seen in each of the model specifications with the data 
from both NHS Grampian and NHS England for comparable 
cancer case numbers (expressed as a range either side of the model 
specification number). Statistical analyses and modelling were 
conducted using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> for Windows <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">Version 20</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">IBM Corp</rs>,

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>NHS Grampian data included 25 278 USC referrals and 10 615 
cancers from 77 practices over a 7-year period. When practice-
years with no cancers diagnosed via the USC pathway in the NHS 
Grampian data set were excluded, there were 24 934 USC referrals 
and 9945 cancers. NHS England data included 4 158 358 USC 
referrals and 955 502 cancers from 8303 practices over a 4-year 
period. When incomplete data (from practice-years with less than 
six recorded cancer cases referred by USC) were excluded from the 
NHS England data, there were 3 808 406 USC referrals and 881 078 
cancers remaining from 6735 practices. Characteristics of the 
included practices are shown in Table 1. The NHS Grampian data 
set included a higher proportion of very small practices (list size 
o3000) than in England (20.8% vs 9.3%). The mean and standard </p>

<p>deviation practice detection and conversion rates for data 
aggregated over 7 years in the NHS Grampian were 0.38 (0.10) 
and 0.18 (0.06), respectively; for NHS England over 4 years, they 
were 0.48 (0.09) and 0.12 (0.06). 
Table 2 shows that, overall, 4003 (37.7%) cancers in the NHS 
Grampian data set were referred by the USC pathway. The 
detection rate was particularly low in 2006-2008; this finding 
appears to reflect unfamiliarity with implementation of the USC 
referral system as more than half of cancers diagnosed after urgent 
referral went through generic urgent pathways as opposed to 
cancer-specific ones (data available on request). From 2009 
onwards, 3435 out of 6639 (51.6%) cancers in the NHS Grampian 
were referred by the USC pathway. In the NHS England data set, 
413 718 out of 881 080 (47.0%) cancers were referred by the USC 
pathway. 
Correlation coefficients between practice detection and conversion 
rates for individual years ranged from 0.08 (95% CI À 0.25 to 0.35) 
to 0.28 (0.08 to 0.53) in NHS Grampian and between 0.24 
(0.21 to 0.26) and 0.26 (0.23 to 0.28) in NHS England, as shown in 
Table 3. When practice data over several years were aggregated, the 
correlation was weakened in both data sets: 2006-2012 in 
NHS Grampian À 0.22 ( À 0.41 to 0.08) and in NHS England 
0.12 (0.09 to 0.14). Limiting the NHS Grampian data to cancers 
diagnosed from 2009 onwards had little effect on the pooled 
correlation: À 0.16 ( À 0.34 to 0.01). The relationship between 
detection and conversion rates is shown graphically in Figure 1 for 
years common to both data sets and for aggregated data. However, 
the positive correlations between detection and conversion rates in 
individual years may be spurious. Both detection and conversion 
rates feature the number of cancers diagnosed via the USC 
pathway as both the numerator and part of the denominator. 
Consequently, in a practice-year with a high proportion of 
'clinically obvious' cancers, that is, clinical presentations that 
clearly meet criteria for USC referral, both detection and 
conversion rates will be relatively high. Conversely, when the 
proportion of clinically obvious cancers is low, both detection and 
conversion rates will be low. This may lead to a spurious 
correlation between the detection and conversion rates, which is 
more likely to occur with small sample sizes and/or substantial </p>

case-mix. When numbers of cancers are pooled, this spurious 
correlation will be diminished. 
In the NHS England data, there was a clear difference between 
detection and conversion rates in their year-to-year correlations. 
For practice detection rates, practice pooled correlations between 
pairs of consecutive years were weak, between 0.20 (95% CI 0.17 to 
0.22) and 0.26 (0.23 to 0.29), suggesting practice detection rates 
were not consistent from year to year. In contrast, year-to-year 
correlations for practice pooled conversion rate were moderately 
strong, between 0.53 (0.51 to 0.55) and 0.55 (0.53 to 0.57), 
suggesting greater consistency from year to year. Table 4 shows the 
results of this analysis with practices subgrouped according to their 
number of cases. Similar year-to-year analysis on NHS Grampian 
data was limited by quite small numbers after excluding practices 
with no cancers in one or the other year, and thus CIs were wide 
(Table 4). 
The simulation modelling of detection rates is reported in Table 5. 
The first column indicates whether the model specification included 
low, medium or high between-practice variation. The observed 
standard deviation values in the second column are consistently larger 
than the standard deviation values used to simulate true practice 
variation, indicating that case-mix increases the observed variance. 
Unsurprisingly, this difference is greater when the number of cases is 
small. The implications of this increase in variance due to case-mix 
are shown in the columns of Table 5 relating to 'poor performing 
practices'. The first pair shows the number of practices in the 
simulations (median with interquartile range) that were specified as 
poorly performing before the addition of case-mix and were 
subsequently detected after the introduction of case-mix variation. 
The second pair of columns shows the total number of practices 
that were in the lowest decile for detection rate after introducing 
random case-mix. 
Comparison of the pattern of standard deviations for different 
levels of between-practice variation (Table 5) with the standard </p>

<p>deviations for practices whose aggregate number of cancers was 
low (25-75), medium (76-150) or large (151-400) from the 
empirical data in Table 1 suggests that the model with moderate 
between-practice variation is most closely matched to the actual 
data from both empirical data sets. The implication of this is that, 
with 25 cancer cases per practice, only a median of 20% (IQR 17 to 
24) poorly performing practices will be correctly identified and 
most practices identified as poorly performing will be incorrectly 
labelled. As the number of cases per practice rises, the accuracy of 
prediction increases, but only slowly and incompletely: with 100 
cases the probability of a poorly performing practice being 
correctly identified is 44% (95% CI 40 to 47), and with 200 cases 
it is 57% (54 to 59). </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>This is the first study to examine the effects of number of cases and 
random case-mix on a publicly reported measure of GP practices' 
performance in the use of USC pathways. The results indicate that 
differences between practices, and apparent quality gradients, seen 
within individual years are weakened when data are aggregated 
over several years, suggesting that case-mix -different cancers with 
different referral pathways -rather than actual clinical perfor-
mance accounts for much of the observed variation. The modelling 
exercise suggests that at least 100 cancer cases per practice are 
necessary before the probability is close to 50% that an observed 
poorly performing practice is actually poorly performing. In terms 
of an average-sized UK practice, it would take B4 years for the 
number of cancer cases to accrue. 
Our choice of two databases allows for both the extra detail 
and duration of the northeast Scotland data set and the breadth 
and generalisability of the NHS England data set. The fact that 
broadly comparable results emerged strengthens our findings </p>

<p>and adds credence to the belief that, in both data sets, the validity 
and accuracy of cancer cases and referrals routes are acceptable. 
Although the Scottish and English data sets were broadly similar, 
they were not identical in their definitions, nor in the time of the 
study in relation to introduction of specific cancer referral 
pathways. Furthermore, the Scottish data were from one region 
only, whereas the English data were from the whole country. 
This precludes making comparisons between the data sets, and 
instead the analysis focuses on within-data set comparisons 
showing that similar findings appear in both. Both data sets had 
limitations when it came to small numbers of cancer cases; in the 
NHS England database, data from practices with less than six 
USC referrals in 1 year were not available. We did not attempt to 
impute these data. In addition, we did not attempt to address 
other possible sources of practice variation, such as differences in 
practice population rather than GP performance. Within the 
Scottish data, there were some single-doctor practices with very 
small list sizes, meaning that it was possible they would have a </p>

<p>year when no cancers were diagnosed. These null data were 
excluded from the analysis since a meaningful detection 
rate could not be calculated. However, as our data suggest 
relatively modest variation in GP performance after adjusting for 
random case-mix, any adjustment for practice characteristics 
would be likely to further reduce the variation in intrinsic GP 
performance. 
We deliberately followed previously reported methods for 
comparing single-year interpractice variation in the use of USC 
referrals, as these measures are currently used in routine reporting 
and public feedback (Meechan et al, 2012). This is despite the fact 
that the method has an obvious limitation in that detection and 
conversion rates are not a naturally complementary pair of 
measures. One unexpected advantage of this pairing, however, is 
that, unlike sensitivity and specificity, the relationship between 
these two measures is not influenced by prevalence. Our finding 
that the correlation between detection and conversion rates was 
diminished (or reversed) by aggregating data over several years </p>

suggests that correlations based on small case numbers may be 
largely spurious. In our modelling, we focused on the detection 
rate, as this was the measure highlighted by media and politicians, 
and also because this showed more year on year variation than the 
conversion rate. It is not the only measure of diagnostic quality, 
however, and further work may need to examine conversion rates 
or other approaches such as imputing specificity. 
Our modelling exercise was based on empirical data from 
NHS England with the detection rate set according to this. 
It was designed to use sample sizes that are representative of </p>

<p>routine practice. With an annual cancer incidence of around 
4.3/1000 per annum, a small practice of 3000 patients can expect 
only around 13 new cancer cases each year, and will need 8 years 
to accumulate B100 cases. A medium-sized practice of 
6000 patients (close to the UK average) will need 4 years. Only 
a very large practice of around 24 000 patients is likely to record 
100 cancer cases in a year. Even with 100 cases, our modelling 
data indicate that the probability of a statistically outlying 
practice being an intrinsically poor performer is still only 
around 50%. At present, most practices identified as poorly </p>

<p>performing from annual data will be wrongly labelled, and most 
poorly performing practices will not be detected. 
Individual case presentations of cancer vary and this study 
highlights the need to consider the number of cases and case-mix 
variation in evaluating the performance of GP practices in their use 
of USC referral. Simply reporting values for detection and 
conversion rates on annual data, and considering all cancers 
together, has a clear potential to mislead both practices and the 
public. Allied concerns relating to case-mix and small volume 
caseloads have recently been highlighted in reporting surgeon 
performance (Walker et al, 2013). 
On the basis of our findings, we propose that any reporting of 
practice rates should now be limited to data aggregated over 
several years and may need to consider each cancer site 
separately. However, the substantial effect of random case-mix 
on observed detection rates, even if GPs follow guidelines 
exactly, means that alternative approaches are needed. We 
suggest two ways to avoid the influence of case-mix on reported 
performance. The first is to examine specifically whether cancer 
cases were referred (or not) in accordance with national 
guidelines. The second is to adopt a 'confidential enquiry' 
approach, employing a case review of designated delayed 
diagnoses as 'never events' (de Wet et al, 2014). Although 
both require more data, and more time to critically reflect 
on it, they would be more transparent -and more likely to 
lead to constructive changes in practice -than the current 
crude approach to identification of supposedly poorly 
performing practices. In the meantime, the widespread public 
reporting of GP practice's use of USC referral pathways based 
on annual data may be misleading and should be interpreted 
with caution until a more robust reporting methodology is in 
place. </p>

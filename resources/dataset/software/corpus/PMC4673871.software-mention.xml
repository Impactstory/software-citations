<p>Abstract </p>

<p>Objective: Obesity is the single biggest public health threat to developed and developing 
economies. In concert with healthy public policy, multi-strategy, multi-level community-
based initiatives appear promising in preventing obesity, with several countries trialling this 
approach. In Australia, multiple levels of government have funded and facilitated a range of 
community-based obesity prevention initiatives (CBI), heterogeneous in their funding, timing, 
target audience and structure. This paper aims to present a central repository of CBI operating 
in Australia during 2013, to facilitate knowledge exchange and shared opportunities for 
learning, and to guide professional development towards best practice for CBI practitioners. </p>

<p>Methods: A comprehensive search of government, non-government and community websites 
was undertaken to identify CBI in Australia in 2013. This was supplemented with data drawn 
from available reports, personal communication and key informant interviews. The data was 
translated into an interactive map for use by preventive health practitioners and other parties. </p>

<p>Results: We identified 259 CBI; with the majority (84%) having a dual focus on physical activity 
and healthy eating. Few initiatives, (n=37) adopted a four-pronged multi-strategy approach 
implementing policy, built environment, social marketing and/or partnership building. </p>

<p>Conclusion: This comprehensive overview of Australian CBI has the potential to facilitate 
engagement and collaboration through knowledge exchange and information sharing 
amongst CBI practitioners, funders, communities and researchers. </p>

<p>Implications: An enhanced understanding of current practice highlights areas of strengths 
and opportunities for improvement to maximise the impact of obesity prevention initiatives. </p>

<p>(e.g. through educational counselling), 
higher level policy or 'social marketing only' 
programs and treatment or management 
oriented projects that worked solely with 
overweight or obese individuals. " 13 For 
this discussion, community-based obesity 
prevention initiatives (CBI) include those with 
a focus on healthy eating and/or physical 
activity adopting a multi-strategy approach 
(policy, built environment, social marketing, 
partnership building), within multiple 
settings (e.g. health, education, community 
and commercial sectors such as community 
organisations, schools, workplaces or clinics) 
and across multiple (socio-ecological) levels, 
excluding one-off events and one-on-one 
educational sessions with individuals or small 
groups of individuals. </p>

<p>In 2008, the Australian Federal Government 
launched a major investment of $932.7 
million, through the National Partnership 
Agreement on Preventive Health (NPAPH), 
to address the rising prevalence of 
lifestyle-related chronic disease through 
communities, early childhood education 
and care environments, schools and 
workplaces, supported by national social 
marketing campaigns. Funding to the states/ 
territories was provided through the Healthy 
Communities Initiative ($71.8 million; 2009-
2014), Healthy Children's Initiative ($244.4 
million; 2011-2018), and Healthy Workers' 
Initiative ($221.8 million; 2009-2018), with an 
agreed monitoring and reporting process to 
meet a set of population-level performance 
benchmarks. These benchmarks were to 
be assessed by the Council of Australian 
Governments (COAG) Reform Council at 
two time points: June 2016 and December 
2017. 14 The Federal Government budget of 
2014 announced the NPAPH will cease as of 
30 June 2014, forecast to generate savings 
to the Federal Government of $367.9 million 
over four years. 15 The future health cost 
burden related to decreased investment in 
prevention remains unclear. </p>

<p>Within states/territories this and other 
funding has provided opportunities 
to expand CBI through local and state 
governments and to direct funding grants 
to individual communities. Some states/ 
territories have also shared strategies, such as 
social marketing campaigns and telephone 
counselling services to reduce duplication 
and costs. 16,17 </p>

<p>These layers of investment make it difficult 
to obtain a comprehensive picture of the 
current landscape of CBI in Australia. Recent </p>

<p>research indicates that a common focus 
of these initiatives has been to increase 
healthy eating and physical activity through 
education and skill building; 18 however, a 
more comprehensive understanding of CBI 
currently operating in Australia is needed. 
This overview aims to increase the awareness 
of the breadth of CBI activity, highlight the 
areas of commonality and scope, catalyse 
discussions and knowledge exchange 
between practitioners, communities, funders 
and researchers, and illustrate the national 
obesity funding investment within Australia. </p>

<p>Objective </p>

<p>This paper reports on a mapping project 
undertaken to identify CBI operating in 
Australia during 2013; to provide a searchable 
online resource to facilitate knowledge 
exchange and shared learning amongst CBI 
practitioners and researchers; and to guide 
professional development towards best 
practice for CBI practitioners. </p>

<p>Methods </p>

<p>A comprehensive web-based review of 
local, state, territory and national initiatives 
was undertaken between 25 March and 
31 December 2013. A total of 189 sites 
were returned using the search terms 
'"community based obesity prevention" 
site:.org.au 2012..2013' [returned 14 sites], 
'"community based obesity prevention" site:. 
gov.au 2012..2013' [returned 50 sites], and 
'"community based obesity prevention" site:. 
edu.au 2012..2013' [returned 125 sites]. These 
websites were systematically examined and 
recorded if they met the inclusion criteria: 
reported on an initiative that focused on 
healthy diet or physical activity. Further 
details of the strategies used were included 
where identified, (policy, built environment, 
social marketing, partnership building). 
Websites were excluded if they did not 
identify an initiative operating in 2013, or if 
the website reported on a once-off single 
event or projects focused solely on individual 
behaviour change through one-to-one 
educational sessions. </p>

<p>The most common finding was an initiative 
connected to the NPAPH, of which the 
Healthy Children, Healthy Workers and 
Healthy Communities initiatives met the 
definition of CBI. The location, scope and 
mandate of the NPAPH were therefore 
examined in detail, including relevant 
implementation plans. 14 This was followed by </p>

<p>individual searches of the websites of the 92 
local government areas funded through the 
Healthy Communities Initiative. </p>

<p>Where information could not be sourced via 
websites, further information was gained 
via email contact, and three key informant 
interviews were conducted with key 
stakeholders from the Healthy Communities 
and Healthy Workers initiatives. Meetings 
with state or territory-based Departments of 
Health and The Australian National Preventive 
Health Agency (ANPHA) helped inform the 
background to this mapping work. </p>

<p>Geographic Information System (GIS) was 
used to integrate the data, <rs id="software-0" type="software">Cartodb</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">v.2.0</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-date">2012</rs>, 
and enable a searchable map interface for 
practitioners. This fully searchable map was 
made freely available on the CO-OPS website 
in October 2013 (www.co-ops.net.au/Pages/ 
About/Map_of_Initiatives.aspx), see Figure 
1. The map will be evaluated by monitoring 
the number of visits to the website, templates 
submitted to update the map, case studies 
submitted to augment featured CBI as well as 
the CO-OPS annual survey. </p>

<p>Ethics approval for this project was obtained 
from Deakin University Human Ethics 
Advisory Group (HEAGH-127_2013). </p>

<p>Results </p>

<p>In total, 259 CBI were identified during 
the searching period. Table 1 shows the 
breakdown between the focus of initiatives 
(healthy eating, physical activity, other) and 
the strategies used to address these foci. 
The four strategies chosen are drawn from 
literature as those with potential (when 
used as part of a multi-strategic, multi-level 
approach) to have an impact on obesity 
prevention long term (policy, partnership 
building, built environment, social 
marketing). 6,9,19 </p>

<p>The majority (n=217 [84%]) had a joint 
physical activity and healthy eating focus. 
Less than half of the initiatives (n=93) 
identified the use of high-level strategies 
to affect obesity prevention longer term. 
Table 1 outlines the combination of single 
and multiple strategies used by the CBI. 
Importantly, the initiatives that operated at 
a strategic level were most likely to combine 
all four strategies (n=37). Fewer initiatives 
combined three of these strategies with 
built environment, partnership building and 
policy being the preferred combination (n=9). 
A number of CBI also reported adopting </p>

<p>the single strategies of policy (n=15), and 
changes to the built environment (n=14). </p>

<p>Table 1 identifies various combinations of 
single and multiple strategies used to address 
the joint or single focus of healthy eating and 
physical activity to combat overweight and 
obesity. </p>

<p>An overview of the target populations shows 
that the majority of CBI targeted the adult 
population, namely 18 to &lt;25 years (20%); 25 
to &lt;45 years (18%); and 45 to &lt;65 years (17%) 
with 17% targeting under 18 years, with &lt;5 
years (7%) and 5 to &lt;12 years (10%). The 
most frequently reported target population 
was Aboriginal people (42%), followed by 
low income populations (35%). Torres Strait 
Islander communities were specifically 
mentioned in 19% of CBI, while culturally and 
linguistically diverse populations (CALD) were 
least targeted (6%). Specific settings were 
not explored in this phase of the mapping 
activity, however, where a CBI self-identified 
a setting, these can be found through the 
free search field on the map. New South 
Wales (21%) and Victoria (20%) reported the 
greatest number of CBI with Tasmania (3%) 
and ACT (4%) reporting least activity, which 
is fairly consistent with population density in 
these states and territories. </p>

<p>The interactive map went live on 21 October 
2013, and the website has recorded 626 
visits in the first five months to March 
2014. Engagement with the map has been 
enhanced further though the provision of an 
online case study template for practitioners 
to provide a narrative about their initiative 
which is appraised and attached to the map. </p>

<p>Discussion and Conclusions </p>

<p>The interactive map provides the first 
visual and searchable central repository of 
CBI activity across Australia. This national 
portrayal and macro-analysis of the obesity 
prevention landscape is further enhanced by 
reporting of the types and combinations of 
strategies employed in different geographical 
locations. This audit approach advances a 
conventional report of summary information, 
and provides a foundation upon which to 
explore, exploit and enrich the data over 
time and provide opportunities for future 
analysis. More detailed data regarding 
reach (population size distribution, 
geographic coverage, duration and capacity); 
characteristics (role of local and state-based 
organisations and government, target groups, 
settings and strategies; quality (best practice </p>

and sustainability of Australian CBI will be 
reported through a nation-wide survey 
currently in progress by CO-OPS. </p>

<p>The majority of initiatives on the map met 
the definition of CBI in terms of focusing 
on healthy eating and/or physical activity, 
however, a minority adopted a multi-strategy 
approach (policy, built environment, social 
marketing, partnership building), with 
implementation across multi settings and at 
multiple levels. The use of a multi-strategy, </p>

is consistent with evidence for prevention 
effectiveness. 10 </p>

amongst CBI practitioners and researchers </p>

<p>through direct access to information on the 
geographic location and basic characteristics 
of each CBI. The development of case study 
narratives based on best practice principles 20 
will contribute a more detailed description 
of individual initiatives being implemented. 
Appraisal of these case studies provides an 
opportunity for practitioners and program 
funders to receive feedback to guide future 
practice. Embedding case studies into the 
map of CBI further enhances information 
sharing. </p>

<p>It is relevant to mention that the new 
Commonwealth budget, announced in 
May 2014, proposes to defund the NPAPH 
initiative. This will impact significantly on 
state/territory evaluations in place to assess 
performance benchmarking and the national 
evaluation commissioned to provide insight 
into this funding approach which recognised 
the need for long-term funding (nine years) 
to achieve systemic population level change. 
The annual update of the interactive map will 
provide important information regarding the 
continuation of these CBI. </p>

<p>Strengths and limitations </p>

<p>Due to the reliance on websites for 
identification of initiatives, it is likely that 
initiatives without a clear web presence 
will not have been included. This limitation 
was partially addressed through the use 
of key informant interviews, meetings and 
workshops with stakeholders and personal 
communications with experts in the field of 
obesity prevention in Australia. A template 
is also provided on the website to enable 
CBI practitioners to add new or edit existing 
initiatives on the map. </p>

<p>The search criteria for data included on the 
map is not mutually exclusive, for example, a 
search to identify programs targeting children 
under 5 years of age will not exclude the 
program if the same program also targets 
school age children. In some instances this 
may appear to be double-counting. </p>

<p>The objective of the map was not to provide 
a detailed dataset for each CBI identified, 
therefore, it is limited in the depth of detail 
provided for each initiative. In its present 
format, the map provides a useful overview 
of current initiatives. Ongoing maintenance 
and development of the map is required to 
ensure up-to-date information and expansion 
to provide opportunities for future analysis 
regarding performance outcomes, cost-
effectiveness and return on investment. </p>

<p>A nationwide survey currently in progress 
by CO-OPS will report upon detailed 
characteristics, quality and likely effectiveness 
and sustainability of Australian initiatives. </p>

<p>Visits to the website provide an estimate 
of access and use, but cannot be used 
to determine collaboration between CBI 
practitioners featured on the map. The use of 
the map as a means to enhance collaboration 
will be explored through the CO-OPS annual 
national survey and future social network 
analysis. </p>

<p>Implications </p>

<p>The map provides a unique snapshot of 
Australian CBI, with one-in-five initiatives 
meeting proposed best practice in 
implementing multiple strategies. While this 
is promising, it also points to opportunities 
for further professional development to 
ensure practitioners understand, promote 
and are supported in the implementation of a 
multi-strategy, multi-level obesity prevention 
response. </p>

<p>Future research </p>

<p>A stronger understanding of the cost-benefit 
relationship between funding for prevention 
and a reduced burden of disease through 
overweight and obesity is required. A more 
detailed explanation (e.g. funding sources) 
of reasons for the adoption of a stronger 
multi-strategy platform by some CBI could 
inform future investment and development 
of preventive health responses. </p>

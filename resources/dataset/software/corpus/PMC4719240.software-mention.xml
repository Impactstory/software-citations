and we believe that this is first report from our geopolitical 
area. 
Clinically the anastomosis between radial and ulnar 
arteries in hand is of great significance when performing 
surgical procedures on hand, forearm or on individual 
arteries. One of the complications of common procedure 
of radial artery like arterial blood sampling is occlusion of 
the artery, however in these situations the hand perfusion 
can be maintained by the ulnar artery through the palmar 
arch. This can be easily established by using Allen's test 
[11] or Doppler ultrasound studies [12] which can 
provide good idea about the continuity of the palmar 
arches. In cases of incomplete palmar arch, as in this case, 
the Allen's test will be negative confirmed with and both 
radius and ulna arteries will behave as 'end arteries'. Thus 
any procedure on radial or ulnar artery needs to be

artery divided into RA and UA at the cubital fossa. There 
was no anastomosis between RA and UA at palm of hand 
and SPA was incomplete. UA gave three palmar digital 
arteries; proper palmar digital artery and two common 
palmar digital arteries which passed to the medial three 
interdigital clefts. RA gave two branches: proper palmar 
digital artery to the radial side of the index finger and an 
arteria princeps pollicis (Fig. 1). </p>

<p>A classic morphology of complete SPA is formed by the 
linkage between superficial palmar branches of the radial 
and ulnar arteries. But other morphology of incomplete 
SPA was reported. The incidence of the incomplete SPA 
reported 10%, 16%, 16% and 21.47% of cases in studies of 
Loukas, et al. (2005), Patnaik, et al. (2002), Al-turk and 
Metcalf. (1984) and Coleman and Anson (1961), 
respectively. Most of the SPA arches (54.76%), in the study 
of Sarkar et al. (2012) were incomplete [3, 5-8]. 
According to Ottone, et al. (2010) the present case is Ulnar 
/ Radiopalmar pattern subtype of incomplete SPA (9). The 
incidence of this variation reported in 8.3%, 3.2% and 
3.6% of cases in studies of Ottone, et al. (2010), Coleman 
and Anson (1961) and Ikeda et al. (1988) [9,3,10].

<p>Clinical Message 
Superficial palmar arch (SPA) as a dominant vascular 
structure supplies a majority of the muscles of the 
palm of the hand. Therefore The SPA variation should 
be considered by orthopaedicians and microvascular 
surgeons performing advanced surgical procedures 
such as arterial repairs, vascular graft applications. </p>

<p>An International Peer Review Journal Publishing Complex, Complicated and Difficult 
Musculoskeletal Cases </p>

<p>Complications are one of the most important events in Career of an Orthopaedic Surgeons. Complications and Complex and 
complicated cases provide an opportunity to learn practical points about patient management and lead to continuous 
improvement in our surgical skills and clinical decision making. 
Journal of Orthopaedic Complications (JOC) is First of its kind journal where a complete journal is dedicated to Complications 
and difficult complex musculoskeletal cases. The submission format is kept very simple and practical. 
Scope of the Journal </p>

<p>JOC will publish complicated/complications of musculoskeletal cases from all faculties including but not limited to Orthopaedic, 
Rheumatology, Physiotherapy, Occupational therapy, Neurology, Neurosurgery, Oncology and Congenital disorders. </p>

<p>Manuscripts must meet one of the following criteria: 
1. Primarily Complex or Difficult Cases 
2. Known and Unknown Complication of a disease, fracture, treatment, implant. 
3. Complications due to associated diagnosed or undiagnosed co-morbidities 
4. A known complication treated with a new or rarely reported method 
5. Any unexpected event in the course of observing or treating a patient 
6. Cases presenting with failed primary management with complicated clinical condition 
7. Delayed presentation of a fracture or disease leading to complex presentation 
8. Unusual findings that shed new light on the possible pathogenesis of a disease or an adverse effect 
9. A small series of cases with unusual Complication. 
10. A technical note demonstrated on a single complicated case. 
11. A series of cases {prospective or retrospective] using particular management modality with common complications over a 
period of time [a case series of complications]. Example a case series of complications of proximal femur nail in treatment of 
intertrochanteric fractures. 
12. Complication Bank: this special section will publish every complex and complicated case associated with orthopaedic 
surgery. Authors can send any case with complications [known or unknown; common or uncommon] and it will be published. 
This need not be with details of management or follow up of the case. The idea is to create a database of complications 
associated with various orthopaedic surgeries and dieases. A single page write up of less than 1000 words will be accepted. </p>

<p>Manuscripts will be reviewed by the Editorial Board and two external referees, and authors will usually receive a decision on 
their manuscript within 8-12 weeks. </p>

<p>All manuscripts are to be submitted via journal submission software '<rs type="software">Scripture</rs>' on the website www.orthocomplications.com. 
Submissions can also be mailed to orthocomplications@gmail.com </p>

<p>JOC will accept following formats of articles: Case Reports, Original article on complications, Complication Bank Cases (as 
above), Case Image, Technical Note on treatment of a complex/complicated case, Video Technique, Surgical Tips on avoiding 
/ treating complications, Case Study /Series, Case Approach, Letter to Editor, Letter to Experts and Expert Opinion </p>

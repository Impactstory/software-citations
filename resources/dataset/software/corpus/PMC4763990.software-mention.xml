<p>Abstract </p>

<p>The ability to synchronize motor movements along with an auditory beat places stringent demands 
on the temporal processing and sensorimotor integration capabilities of the nervous system. Links 
between millisecond-level precision of auditory processing and the consistency of sensorimotor 
beat synchronization implicate fine auditory neural timing as a mechanism for forming stable 
internal representations of, and behavioral reactions to, sound. Here, for the first time, we 
demonstrate a systematic relationship between consistency of beat synchronization and trial-by-
trial stability of subcortical speech processing in preschoolers (ages 3 and 4 years old). We 
conclude that beat synchronization might provide a useful window into millisecond-level neural 
precision for encoding sound in early childhood, when speech processing is especially important 
for language acquisition and development. </p>

<p>Learning requires ongoing and repeated associations between stimuli and their implications 
(Hebb, 1949). Across modalities, stable perceptual representation of stimuli from one 
experience to the next allows for the emergence of coherent internal representations, while </p>

<p>neural instability characterizes individuals with clinical disorders (e.g., autism, dyslexia, 
attention deficit, and schizophrenia; cf. Dinstein et al., 2015). This neural stability comes 
into play when an individual interacts with sound; unstable processing in the auditory 
system has been observed in individuals with language impairments (Ahissar et al., 2000;  Evans et al., 2009; Hornickel et al., 2009; Hornickel and Kraus, 2013). Stable neural 
processing of structured temporal patterns may be particularly crucial for language 
acquisition and development: anticipation and detection of the timing of auditory events 
allows a listener to tune in to and predict important acoustic features (Large and Jones,  1999; McAuley et al., 2006) necessary for distinguishing and reproducing syllabic segments, 
prosodic cues, and the rapidly changing acoustic features that differentiate meaningful 
segments of speech (Baruch and Drake, 1997; Bertoncini and Mehler, 1981; Eimas et al.,  1971; Ramus, 2000; Saffran et al., 1996; Tallal, 1980). Thus, stable neural coding of speech 
timing during early childhood -a period of intense, rapid learning and an age critical for 
mapping meaning to auditory input (Kuhl et al., 1992; Ruben, 1997) -could be acutely 
important for language learning. </p>

<p>Such precision and stability of speech processing in the human auditory system can be 
captured by examining the intertrial stability of the frequency following response (FFR) to a 
consonant -vowel speech syllable, a noninvasive measure of subcortical neural encoding, 
which records the summation of synchronous electrical activity originating from the 
auditory midbrain. The FFR reflects both temporal and spectral physiognomies of auditory 
stimuli with fine resolution (Skoe and Kraus, 2010). A high degree of intertrial stability of 
the FFR is associated with good reading ability in children, while intertrial variability has 
been observed to correlate with poorer reading skills (Hornickel and Kraus, 2013). </p>

<p>Beat synchronization, or entraining a motor movement to an auditory beat, has proved an 
intriguing tool for assessing sensorimotor timing (reviewed systematically in Repp, 2005;  Repp and Su, 2013), and has been linked to the aforementioned intertribal neural stability of 
the FFR to speech in adolescents (Tierney and Kraus, 2013a,b). Synchronizing to an 
external beat likely relies on temporal fidelity for auditory perceptual coding, motor 
production, and coupling between auditory and motor systems (Sowi≈Ñski and Dalla Bella,  2013). The auditory midbrain appears to be particularly important for beat synchronization, 
as it is uniquely positioned to play an integrating role: inferior colliculus receives ascending 
connections from subcortical auditory structures and motor areas (e.g., basal ganglia; 
Coleman and Clerici, 1987; Kudo and Niimi, 1980) and descending input from cortex (Bajo  et al., 2010), in addition to sending information to cerebellum (another area crucial for fine 
motor control) via dorsolateral pontine nuclei (Hashikawa, 1983; Mower et al., 1979; Saint  Marie, 1996). </p>

<p>Examining links between sound processing in auditory midbrain and beat synchronization 
could inform our knowledge of the biology responsible for transformation of perceived 
periodicity in auditory stimuli to motor output. Tierney and Kraus (2013a,b) have 
established a systematic relationship between intertrial stability of subcortical speech 
encoding and the consistency of beat synchronization in adolescents, proposing auditory 
system stability as a biological mechanism common to speech processing and beat-keeping. 
In young children, the ability to synchronize to a beat relates to precision of subcortical </p>

<p>speech-envelope tracking, as well as pre-literacy skills thought to predict future reading 
skills such as phonological awareness and auditory short-term memory (Woodruff Carr et  al., 2014). </p>

<p>Here, we expand upon previous work (Woodruff Carr et al., 2014) to explore the 
neurophysiology underlying individual differences in preschoolers who are able to 
synchronize motor movements to isochronous beats at prosodic stress rates. We predicted 
more consistent auditory-motor timing, as revealed through beat synchronization, would 
relate to higher levels of intertrial neural stability for processing speech syllables. 
Furthermore, our previous work identifying links between beat synchronization and neural 
envelope tracking precision led us to hypothesize that stability of low-frequency encoding in 
particular would relate to beat synchronization, because the envelope measure is filtered to 
capture low-frequency modulations. Our findings suggest that stability of auditory neural 
encoding may be an important foundation for sensorimotor integration in preschoolers. 
Furthermore, beat synchronization may serve as a useful behavioral tool for assessing 
developmental auditory neural function in young children. </p>

<p>2. Methods </p>

<p>2.1. Participants </p>

<p>Twenty-five children (15 females), ages three and four years old (M = 4.34, SD = 0.56), 
were recruited from the Chicago area. No child had a history of a neurologic condition, a 
diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, a family history of language learning disorders, or 
second language exposure. All children had normal age-adjusted scaled scores for both 
verbal (M = 13.48, SD = 3.24) and nonverbal (M = 13.52, SD = 2.84) intelligence estimated 
with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, third edition (WPPSI; 
Pearson/PsychCorp, San Antonio, TX), passed a screening of peripheral auditory function 
(normal otoscopy, Type A tympanograms, and distortion product otoacoustic emissions at 
least 6 dB above the noise floor from 0.5 to 4 kHz) and had normal click-evoked auditory 
brainstem responses (identifiable wave V latency of &lt;5.8 ms). Informed consent and assent 
was obtained from legal guardians and children, respectively, in accordance with procedures 
approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board and children were 
monetarily compensated for their participation. </p>

<p>2.2. Beat synchronization </p>

<p>Our beat synchronization task was based on Kirshner and Tomasello's (2009) social 
drumming entrainment paradigm for preschoolers. The experimenter sat across from the 
child with two conga drums between them, one for the experimenter and one for the 
participant. Each conga had a Pulse Percussion DR-1 drum trigger attached to the underside 
of its drumhead to record the drum hits and convert vibrations into voltage in real time with 
no delay. The experimenter covertly listened and drummed to an isochronous beat presented 
through an in-ear headphone and encouraged the child to imitate and drum along with the 
experimenter. Auditory stimuli and drum hits of both the experimenter and participant were 
recorded as two separate two-channel recordings in <rs id="software-0" type="software">Audacity</rs> version <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">2.0.5</rs>. Four trials were 
performed: two trials at 2.5 Hz followed by two trials at 1.67 Hz. Each trial was 20 s in </p>

<p>duration, resulting in 50 isochronous drum hits for the 2.5 Hz trials and 33 drum hits for the 
1.67 Hz trials. The use of two rates allowed for the assessment of general synchronization 
ability as opposed to synchronization to a specific rate, reducing the potential bias of an 
individual's preferred tempo. </p>

<p>2.2.1. Data processing-Synchronization data were processed using software developed 
in house in <rs id="software-2" type="software">MATLAB</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="creator">Mathworks, Inc</rs>., Natick, MA). Due to the high intersubject 
variability in intensity and rapidity of drumming, drum hits for the experimenter and 
participant were detected by setting an amplitude threshold and a refractory period on a 
participant-by-participant basis. The first point at which the signal exceeded the amplitude 
threshold was marked as a hit, immediately followed by a refractory period during which the 
program did not mark peaks (to ensure multiple points were not marked for each hit). 
Accuracy of automated hit detection was checked manually to ensure onsets were correctly 
marked for each hit. </p>

<p>2.2.2. Data analysis-Beat synchronization ability was assessed using circular statistics 
(Fisher, 1993), a useful tool for assessing sensorimotor synchronization when there is not 
one-to-one correspondence of hits and pacing stimuli (Kirschner and Tomasello, 2009;  Sowi≈Ñski and Dalla Bella, 2013; Fujii and Schlaug, 2013), as is the case with this dataset: 
children frequently missed hits or did not synchronize continuously over a session. Each 
drum hit was assigned a relative phase angle (Œ∏ or "accuracy") in degrees by subtracting the 
hit time from the nearest experimenter's hit, dividing the result by the ISI, and multiplying 
by 360. The mean of all vectors resulted in R, a measurement of the extent to which 
participants tended to maintain a constant temporal relationship between their drum hits and 
the experimenter's. We define beat synchronization "consistency" as the average vector 
length across each of the two trials and across both rates. These two measures seem largely 
independent (correlation between consistency and accuracy: r (25) = ‚àí0.275, p = 0.183). 
Recent work has shown the ability to synchronize to an external beat is still developing 
during this age (Kirschner and Tomasello, 2009; Woodruff Carr et al., 2014). Therefore, 
Rayleigh's test was applied to the set of all vectors produced in the two trials for a given rate 
to determine whether a participant was successfully synchronizing (the null hypothesis of 
this test is that the distribution of data points occur randomly in time near or away from the 
pacing stimuli onsets, indicative of chance performance; p &gt; 0.05). The two trials at each 
rate were combined to compute a Rayleigh's p-value for each rate. If a child's Rayleigh's 
test resulted in a p &lt;0.05 at both rates, the child was included in analyses. Our previous work 
(Woodruff Carr et al., 2014) investigated group differences in neural processing between 
children who could (p &lt; 0.05) and could not (p &gt; 0.05) synchronize; the current 
investigation expands upon this work by investigating neural correlates of synchronization 
ability within an expanded group of successful synchronizers. </p>

<p>2.3. Neurophysiology </p>

<p>2.3.1. Stimuli-Frequency following responses (FFRs) were elicited to 170 ms six-formant 
stop consonant -vowel speech syllables [ba], [da], and [ga] at 80 dB SPL at a 4.35 Hz 
sampling rate. Syllables were synthesized at 20 kHz with voicing onset at 5 ms, a 50 ms 
formant transition, and a 120 ms steady state vowel using a Klatt-based formant synthesizer </p>

<p>(Klatt, 1980). Stimuli differed only in onset frequency of the second formant (F 2 ; [ba] = 900 
Hz, [da] = 1700 Hz, [ga] = 2480 Hz), shifting to 1240 Hz for the steady-state vowel. Over 
the transition period for all stimuli the first and third formants were dynamic (F 1 = 400-720 
Hz, F 3 = 2580-2500 Hz) with the fundamental frequency, fourth, fifth, and sixth formants 
constant (F 0 = 100, F 4 = 3300, F 5 =3750, and F 6 = 4900 Hz). All stimuli were presented in 
alternating polarities (stimulus waveform was inverted 180¬∞) with an interstimulus interval 
of 81 ms controlled by <rs id="software-3" type="software">E-Prime</rs> version <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">2.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Psychology Software Tools, Inc</rs>., Sharpsburg, 
PA). Each stimulus was presented 4200 times, with presentation order randomized for each 
participant. </p>

<p>Additionally, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were collected to a 100 ¬µs square wave 
click stimulus presented in rarefaction at 80 dB SPL at a 31.3 Hz sampling rate. 2000 
sweeps were presented. </p>

<p>2.3.2. Recording parameters-Stimuli were presented monaurally to the right ear 
through an insert earphone (ER-3, Etymotic Research, Elk Grove Village, IL) while the 
participant sat watching a movie of their choice in a sound-attenuated booth (IAC Acoustics, 
Bronx, NY). The left ear remained unblocked so that the soundtrack of the movie (&lt;40 dB 
SPL) was audible but not loud enough to mask presented stimuli. FFRs were collected using 
BioSEMI Active2 with an ActiABR module recorded in <rs id="software-5" type="software">LabView</rs> <rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-number">2.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-5" type="creator">National Instruments</rs>, Austin, TX). Responses were digitized at 16.384 kHz and collected with an 
online bandpass filter from 100 to 3000 Hz (20 dB/decade roll-off). The active electrode was 
placed at the vertex (Cz), with references on each earlobe. Grounding electrodes CMS and 
DRL were placed on the forehead at Fp1 and Fp2, respectively. Only ipsilateral-referenced 
(Cz-Right earlobe) responses were used in analyses. Offset voltage was &lt;50 mV for all 
electrodes. </p>

<p>2.3.3. Data reduction and processing-FFRs to speech stimuli were offline amplified 
in the frequency domain 20 dB per decade for 3 decades below 100 Hz, bandpass filtered 
from 70 to 2000 Hz (12 dB/octave roll-off), segmented into epochs with an interval of ‚àí40 
to 210 ms (in relation to the stimulus onset), and baseline-corrected to the pre-stimulus 
period. Responses exceeding ¬±35 ¬µV were rejected as artifacts and remaining sweeps were 
averaged. Final responses to each syllable comprised 2000 artifact-free sweeps of each 
polarity, and responses to the two polarities were added to accentuate the response to the 
speech envelope (Aiken and Picton, 2008) and limit the influence of cochlear microphonic 
and stimulus artifact (Campbell et al., 2012). Data reduction occurred in <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> using 
custom scripts. </p>

<p>2.3.4. Data analysis-The FFR faithfully reproduces spectrotemporal stimulus features 
due to the inferior colliculus' ability to encode fine timing information (Liu et al., 2006;  Warrier et al., 2011). Intertrial stability of the ABR was assessed using a procedure 
previously reported (Hornickel and Kraus, 2013; Tierney and Kraus, 2013a,b).To calculate 
the stability of a participant's response to the speech stimuli, 2000 of 4000 trials were 
randomly selected and averaged. The remaining 2000 trials were also averaged. The two 
sub-averaged waveforms were then correlated over the 0 to 170 ms range to determine their 
similarity. These steps were repeated 300 different times, each with different random </p>

<p>samplings of trials, and the 300 correlation values were averaged to generate a final measure 
of intertrial neural response stability. Neural stability for encoding the click stimulus was 
assessed over 0 to 11.95 ms of the response using the same methodology: the two sub-
averaged waveforms (1000 randomly selected, averaged trials) were correlated to determine 
similarity 100 times, each with different random samplings of trials, and the correlation 
values were averaged. To specifically examine the timing variability in frequency encoding 
of the 170 ms speech-evoked FFR, intertrial phase-locking (Tierney and Kraus, 2013a,b)  was calculated in 20 Hz windows surrounding the fundamental frequency of the stimulus 
(100 Hz) and its harmonics up to 1000 Hz. Time-frequency spectrum was calculated using a 
short-time fast Fourier transform that resulted in a matrix containing two measures for each 
time √ó frequency point: a vector length (the extent to which each frequency is encoded in the 
FFR) and phase (the timing of that frequency). To specifically analyze the timing variability, 
each vector was transformed into a unit vector. For each frequency, the 4000 vectors were 
averaged and the length of the resulting vector was calculated as a measure of the 
consistency of phase across trials. Low frequency phase-locking was captured by averaging 
across the vectors for 100, 200, 300, and 400 Hz, while high frequency phase-locking was 
computed as a mean of the vectors for harmonics 500-1000 Hz. Intertrial neural stability 
and phase-locking correlation values were Fisher and log transformed to conform to the 
expectations of a linear model (normality and sphericity). Data analysis occurred in 
<rs type="software">MATLAB</rs>. </p>

<p>2.4. Statistical analysis </p>

<p>Pearson correlations were used to compare intertrial neural stability and phase-locking 
across stimuli (mean of [ba] + [da] + [ga]) to beat synchronization consistency. Phase-
locking was averaged across low-frequency harmonics (100-400 Hz) and high-frequency 
harmonics (500-1000 Hz). Hierarchical two-step linear regressions were employed to 
determine how neural stability and phase-locking predicted variance in beat synchronization 
over and above demographic factors. Statistics were computed using <rs id="software-9" type="software">SPSS</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-9" type="creator">SPSS, Inc</rs>., 
Chicago, IL). </p>

<p>3. Results </p>

<p>3.1. Intertrial neural stability </p>

<p>We found a systematic relationship between beat synchronization consistency (a measure of 
the extent to which participants were able to maintain a constant temporal relationship 
between their drum hits and the pacing stimulus events) and intertrial neural stability, a 
measure of trial-by-trial variability in auditory midbrain. Those who more consistently 
synchronized had higher intertrial neural stability (composite of [ba], [da], and [ga]: r (25) = 
0.554, p = 0.004; Fig. 1a). There was no relationship between beat synchronization accuracy 
and intertrial neural stability (r (25) = 0.092, p = 0.663). This relationship was specific to 
periodic stimuli such as speech: intertrial stability of the click-evoked auditory brainstem 
response (ABR) did not correlate with beat synchronization (r (25) = 0.048, p = 0.819). </p>

<p>To determine the unique predictability of beat synchronization from neural response 
stability, we performed a hierarchical linear regression. On the first step the independent </p>

<p>variables sex, age, and verbal and non-verbal intelligence scores failed to predict unique 
variance in beat synchronization (R 2 = 0.219, F (4,20) = 1.339, p = 0.270). On the second step 
we added the independent variable of intertrial neural stability. This step improved the 
model, explaining an additional 23.3% of beat synchronization variance (F (1,19) = 8.067, p = 
0.010), over and above age, sex, IQ, and vocabulary. Our overall model accounts for 45.2% 
(F (5,19) = 3.129, p = 0.032) of variance in beat synchronization consistency (see Table 1A 
for full regression results). Assuming an alpha level of p &lt; 0.05, a post hoc power analysis 
revealed a large effect size (Cohen's f 2 =0.425) and sufficient power (0.816). </p>

<p>3.2. Intertrial neural phase-locking </p>

<p>To investigate intertrial stability at specific frequencies, a measure of intertrial phase-
locking to the fundamental frequency (F 0 ) and its harmonics was computed. We again 
discovered a systematic relationship between consistency of beat synchronization and phase-
locking, specifically at lower frequencies: F 0 and its first three harmonics (composite of 
[ba], [da], and [ga] at 100-400 Hz: r (25) = 0.609, p = 0.001; Fig. 1b), as was reported for 
adolescents in previous work (Tierney and Kraus, 2013a,b). Fig. 2 further illustrates this 
relationship between intertrial neural phase-locking and beat synchronization consistency. 
Investigation of higher frequency phase-locking (500-1000 Hz) revealed no link to beat 
synchronization consistency (r (25) = 0.330, p = 0.108; see Table 2 for correlations between 
phase-locking to each frequency and beat synchronization consistency), suggesting a 
frequency specificity of this effect. These relationships were not observed for 
synchronization accuracy (100-400 Hz: r (25) = 0.039, p = 0.853; 500-1000 Hz: r (25) = 
‚àí0.009, p = 0.965). </p>

<p>Again, hierarchical linear regression modeling was performed to control for demographic 
factors. On the first step the independent variables sex, age, and verbal and non-verbal 
intelligence did not predict unique variance of beat synchronization, but with the addition of 
the independent variable of low-frequency phase-locking the model was improved, 
explaining an additional 26.8% of beat synchronization consistency variance (F (1,19) = 
9.927, p = 0.005), over and above demographic factors. The overall model accounts for 
48.7% (F (5,19) = 3.605, p = 0.018) of variance in consistency of beat synchronization. (See 
Table 1B for full regression results.) Assuming an alpha level of p&lt; 0.05, a post hoc power 
analysis revealed a large effect size (Cohen's f 2 =0.522) and sufficient power (0.887). This 
effect was specific to lower frequencies (100-400 Hz): incorporating high frequency (500-
1000 Hz) phase-locking into the regression model in a third step did not improve its fit (ŒîR 2 
&lt; 0.001, p = 0.943). </p>

<p>4. Discussion </p>

<p>These results suggest that successful beat synchronization in young children relies in part on 
stable temporal encoding in the auditory system. Less variability when encoding sound may 
allow for more regularly-timed motor reactions. We propose trial-by-trial neural stability 
supports the developmental process of coordinating auditory-motor beat synchronization in 
young children. The present findings are in line with previous studies linking the ability to 
tap consistently to a beat and stability of subcortical sound processing (Tierney and Kraus, </p>

<p>2013a,b), and provide a unique developmental perspective for a neural timing metric that 
underlies literacy skills (Hornickel and Kraus, 2013; Tierney and Kraus, 2013a,b). This 
mechanism appears to be in place at an early age, during the development of many 
important language skills, and prior to explicit reading instruction. </p>

<p>During beat synchronization, perception and production systems must interact 
synchronously for optimal performance: the brain extracts and estimates stimulus periodicity 
as well as assesses discrepancies between the stimulus and one's own motor output 
(Rauschecker, 2011). The subcortical nervous system works to detect sub-second 
differences in intervals (basal ganglia) and integrate this performance feedback across 
modalities (through connections from the dorsal cochlear nucleus to the cerebellum) to make 
subtle timing adjustments (Merchant et al., 2008), resulting in error-correction of 
asynchronies that does not always necessitate conscious effort (Ito, 2008; Repp, 2000;  Schwartze and Kotz, 2013). Although the influence of motor variability during beat 
synchronization cannot be ruled out, we believe this is not a main factor influencing our 
results. Other work with children this age reports no correlation between motor variability in 
spontaneous tapping and synchronization tasks (Drake et al., 2000), suggesting that 
variability in synchronization performance in young children is primarily driven by factors 
other than motor variability. We suggest our neural stability measure captures auditory-
motor integration, and future work is needed to parse the influence of these separate, but 
connected, systems. </p>

<p>Our results suggest coherence of temporal encoding across timescales. In particular, we 
demonstrate rapid intertrial neural stability for encoding frequency information from 100 to 
400 Hz (for speech stimuli presented at 4.35 Hz) relates to consistency of beat 
synchronization (to rates approximating speech syllables, at 1.67 and 2.5 Hz; see Table 3). 
This connection between millisecond-level timing in the auditory midbrain and coordination 
of motor movements to synchronize at much slower rates may be a function of hierarchical 
temporal scaffolding, with incredibly fast neural fidelity (i.e., intertrial stability of the FFR 
for dynamic formant transitions and periodic vowels) acting as temporal subdivisions to 
support sensorimotor synchrony (i.e., beat synchronization consistency) at slower rates. This 
finding is coherent with previous work demonstrating concomitance between beat 
synchronization and low-frequency temporal encoding precision: correlations were observed 
between beat synchronization consistency and subcortical envelope tracking, but not for 
broadband stimulus encoding (Woodruff Carr et al., 2014). Together, we suggest the ability 
to tune in to and exploit slow modulations of spectral information emerges first 
developmentally, supporting more stable trial-by-trial neural encoding. </p>

<p>The FFR is generated by a summation of simultaneous, synchronously-firing neurons 
throughout subcortical auditory nuclei; therefore intertrial variability of an FFR may result 
from a number of circumstances: a failure of eighth nerves to synchronize (e.g., auditory 
neuropathy), greater receptor adaptation or fatigue, and/or slower recovery from firing (i.e., 
prolonged refractory periods) (Don et al., 1977; Starr et al., 2003; Schaette et al., 2005). It is 
difficult to pinpoint the cause of this jitter, but future work using intracranial recordings is

<p>2015; Patel et al., 2009), it may be possible to explore local temporal jitter within inferior 
colliculus, a primary generator of the FFR, and how this relates to beat synchronization 
abilities. </p>

<p>The ability to consistently perceive and anticipate time intervals in sound streams may 
explain previously-observed links between auditory-motor synchronization and 
phonological processing: if input to the auditory system is not coherent from one experience 
to the next, this could hinder the developmental of a refined phonemic inventory. Increased 
neural variability would make the process of learning the correct probabilities and statistics 
of acoustic events challenging, and individuals with poor neural stability could exhibit 
difficulties in predicting their environment. In the case of autism, individuals with greater 
neural noise also exhibit heightened sensitivity to details at the consequence of an impaired 
ability to integrate details into gestalt percepts (Dinstein et al., 2015). Neural instability 
might be responsible for some of the deficits exhibited by children with language difficulties 
who struggle to process timing information in speech, through the process of stochastic 
resonance (McDonnell and Abbott, 2009). Stochastic resonance is a phenomenon where a 
signal normally too weak to be detected is boosted by noise. This may bias children with 
autism to focus on details rather than attempt to integrate them, and could also explain a 
pattern observed in the auditory domain for children with dyslexia. These children with 
auditory-based learning disorders exhibit an allophonic mode of speech perception, 
demonstrating higher sensitivity to irrelevant phonemic distinctions (Serniclaes et al., 2004). 
Supporting this idea, greater variability in auditory-neurophysiological responses elicited by 
speech have been reported in poor readers (Hornickel and Kraus, 2013; White-Schwoch et  al., 2015) and animal models of dyslexia (Centanni et al., 2013). </p>

<p>In light of our current results, we suggest more stable trial-by-trial encoding of low-
frequency (100 to 400 Hz) spectrotemporal acoustic features supports stable internal 
representations of sounds imperative for language learning. This stability of sound encoding 
might eventually bootstrap phonological development through cognitive systems that are 
engaged during listening and learning (cognitive-sensory coupling) such as attention and 
working memory (cf. Kraus and White-Schwoch, 2015), subsequently facilitating reading 
acquisition. Additionally, individuals diagnosed with speech and language impairments such 
as specific language impairment and dyslexia are less accurate than age-and language-
matched controls at synchronizing to prosodic stress-rate tempi (Corriveau and Goswami,  2009; Thomson et al., 2006; Thomson and Goswami, 2008), suggesting that unstable neural 
responses may contribute to poor auditory processing important for both beat 
synchronization and development of literacy skills. </p>

<p>Although the present work does not explicitly relate these metrics to language proficiency, it 
does reveal a relationship between subcortical speech processing and auditory-motor 
synchronization at a prosodic rate, both metrics that independently relate to language 
competency (Hornickel and Kraus, 2013; Tierney and Kraus, 2013a,b; Thomson and  Goswami, 2008; White-Schwoch et al., 2015; Woodruff Carr et al., 2014). Moreover, we 
observed this relationship between beat synchronization consistency and auditory neural 
stability only in response to periodic speech-like sounds and not acoustically-simple click 
stimuli (cf. Hornickel and Kraus, 2013), which we believe provides further evidence that the </p>

<p>degree of neural fidelity with which an individual is able to resolve dynamic stimuli such as 
speech is intimately tied to beat synchronization. </p>

<p>5. Conclusion </p>

<p>In summary, we provide biological evidence of relationships between auditory-motor beat 
synchronization and intertrial neural stability for encoding speech sounds, establishing these 
links for the first time in emergent readers. We suggest that stable neural responses to sound 
may be integral to the emergence of sensorimotor synchronization skills. These findings 
illuminate a potential underlying neural mechanism that links the ability to synchronize and 
development of phonological processing during preschool years, as observed in previous 
work (Woodruff Carr et al., 2014). Encouragingly, neural synchrony can be improved 
through auditory training (Hornickel et al., 2012; Russo et al., 2005; Song et al., 2012). In 
addition, musical training has been shown to improve beat synchronization (Slater et al.,  2013). Given relationships observed in the present work, it seems possible that a rhythm-
based music training program might prove successful for refining temporal processing and 
consequential language and literacy skills (Bhide et al., 2013; Kuhl, 2007). Future work 
exploring the potential therapeutic benefits of an auditory-motor integration task, such as 
drumming in time to music or speech, could inform preemptive treatment for children with 
substandard auditory processing before behavioral struggles manifest. </p>

<p>To further illustrate the robust relationship between intertrial neural phase-locking and beat 
synchronization, participants were dichotomized as relatively (a) poor (N= 13) or (b) good 
(N= 12) synchronizers based on a median split according to their beat synchronization 
consistency. The good beat synchronization group's phase-locking power to the stimulus 
[da] is more robust for the fundamental frequency (100 Hz) and its harmonics (at 200,300, 
and 400 Hz; F (1,23) = 12.967, p = 0.002). </p>

<p>Hierarchical two-step linear regression results: (A) demographics alone do not significantly explain variability 
in beat synchronization, but the addition of intertrial neural stability significantly improves the model, 
explaining 23.3% (p = 0.010) of beat synchronization variance over and above age, sex, and intelligence. 
Combined with demographic measures, this model predicts 45.2% of variance in consistency of beat 
entrainment (p = 0.032). (B) The addition of neural phase-locking significantly improves the model, 
explaining 26.8% (p = 0.005) of beat synchronization variance over and above age, sex, and intelligence. 
Combined with demographic measures, this model predicts 48.7% of variance in consistency of beat 
entrainment (p = 0.018). </p>

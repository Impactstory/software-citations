<p>Abstract: MiR-381 has been reported to be dysregulated in several human cancers. However, 
the function and mechanism of miR-381 in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. In the 
present study, the miR-381 expression was assessed in a cohort of 113 CRC specimens using 
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTq-PCR), which demonstrated that miR-381 
was significantly downregulated in CRC and correlated with distant metastasis and tumor, node, 
and metastasis (TNM) stage. Functional study revealed that restoration of miR-381 significantly 
inhibited the invasion, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CRC cells. 
Luciferase reporter assay validated that Twist1, an important EMT inducer, was a direct target 
of miR-381, and rescued Twist1 attenuated the function of miR-381 in CRC cells. Correlation 
analysis also revealed an inverse correlation between miR-381 and Twist1 expression levels 
in CRC specimens. Taken together, our results highlight the significance of miR-381/Twist1 
interaction in the development and progression of CRC, and suggest that restoration of miR-381 
may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the patients with CRC. 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most malignant and leading causes of cancers 
worldwide. 
1,2 Although there has been substantial progress in the treatment for patients 
with CRC, approximately half of them die within 5 years, mainly due to metastasis; </p>

<p>3,4 </p>

<p>thus, further investigation into the underlying molecular mechanisms is of great clinical 
significance. Recently, increasing reports have revealed the close relationship between dys-
regulated microRNAs (miRNAs) and the development of CRC, which highlights the role 
of miRNAs as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in patients with CRC. </p>

<p>5-7 </p>

<p>miRNAs are a class of short and noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate the 
expression of protein-coding genes by directly binding their 3′ untranslated region 
(3′-UTR), leading to the posttranscriptional translation inhibition or mRNA 
degradation. 
8,9 In CRC, many miRNAs have been found to be involved in the regula-
tion of multiple cellular functions, such as cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. </p>

<p>10 </p>

<p>For example, miR-143 and miR-145 function as tumor suppressors by inhibiting cell 
proliferation, invasion, and metastasis, 
11,12 while miR-21 acts as an important promoter 
of oncogenesis. 
13,14 CRC pathogenesis is particularly accompanied by the epithelial-
mesenchymal transition (EMT) that is considered the primary step in distant metastasis 
of many types of cancer, the major concern in clinical cancer therapy. 
15,16 Recent 
findings showed that miRNA is important in regulating the EMT process in CRC. </p>

<p>17-19 </p>

<p>Therefore, identification of EMT-associated miRNAs as biomarkers or therapeutic 
targets is of great importance. </p>

<p>Decreased miR-381 has been reported in breast, </p>

<p>20 </p>

<p>pituitary, 
21 and prostate cancer, 
22 suggesting its tumor sup-
pressive function. For example, Ming et al found miR-381 
suppressed the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells 
by targeting Cx43, an enhancer of the metastasis of breast can-
cer cells. 
20 Recently, Liang et al also confirmed that miR-381 
was downregulated in colon cancer. 
23 However, the clinical 
significance and role of miR-381 in CRC remains unclear. 
In the present study, we examined the expression levels of 
miR-381 in an expanded cohort of CRC tissues and several 
cell lines and found that miR-381 was significantly down-
regulated in CRC tissues and significantly correlated with 
distant metastasis and tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) 
stage. Further study revealed that overexpression of miR-381 
could inhibit the invasiveness and EMT of CRC cells, at least 
partially, by targeting an important EMT inducer Twist1. </p>

<p>Materials and methods 
Tissue samples and cell lines </p>

<p>A cohort of 113 CRC tumor tissues and 51 paired normal 
mucosal tissues were obtained from Xiangya Hospital between 
April 2012 and October 2014. These samples were from 113 
patients with CRC who had not undergone radiation therapy or 
chemotherapy before the surgery and had their samples stored 
at -80°C. The clinicopathologic information of the patients 
are summarized in Table 1. Written informed consent was 
obtained from all the study participants and the use of these 
samples was approved by the ethical review committees of the 
Xiangya Hospital Ethic Committee of Central South Univer-
sity. Five CRC cell lines (HCT116, SW620, LOVO, HT29, 
and SW480) and normal colonic cell line NCM460 were pur-
chased from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in 
suggested medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum 
(FBS) and in 5% CO 2 humid atmosphere at 37°C. </p>

<p>rna isolation and rTq-Pcr </p>

<p>Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), according to the 
manufacturer's instruction, and reverse transcribed using 
the Primer Script RT reagent Kit (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Otsu, 
Japan). The relative expression of Twist1 was detected 
by SYBR Green real-time quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction (RTq-PCR) assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., 
Hercules, CA, USA), and β-actin was used as internal 
control. Primers used for Twist1 and β-actin are as follows: 
Twist1, forward: 5′-AGAAGTCTGCGGGCTGTGGCG-3′, 
reverse: 5′-GAGGGCAGCGTGGGGATGATC-3′; β-actin, 
5′-AGTGTGACGTGGACATCCGCAAAG-3′ (forward), </p>

<p>5′-ATCCACATCTGCTGGAAGGTGGAC-3′ (reverse). The 
relative expression of miR-381 was determined using mirVana 
RTq-PCR miRNA Detection Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), 
and small nuclear U6 RNA was used as internal control. The 
specific primers for miRNA-381 and U6 were purchased from 
GeneCopoeia (Rockville, MD, USA). All experiments were 
performed in at least triplicate and the relative expression 
levels were calculated using the 2 
-∆∆Ct method. </p>

<p>Knockdown of Twist1 by sirna </p>

<p>To knockdown Twist1 expression, the siRNAs (si-Twist1, 
forward: 5′-GGUACAUCGACUUCCUCUAUU-3′; reverse: 
5′-UAGAGGAAGUCGAUGUACCUU-3′) and negative con-
trol (si-NC, forward: 5′-UUCGACUGUACUCGACAUCTT-3′; 
reverse: 5′-GAUGUCGAGUACAGUCGAATT-3′) were 
purchased from GenePharma Company (Shanghai, People's 
Republic of China). A total of 300 pmol of si-Twist1 or si-NC 
was transfected into HT29 and SW480 cells using Lipo-
fectamine RNAi MAX Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
according to the manufacturer's protocol. </p>

<p>primer: 5′-GTGGGACGCGGACATGGACCA-3′) and 
cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector, and the empty pCD-
NA3.1 vector was used as control. Lipofectamine 2000 
Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for cell 
transfection following the manufacturer's protocol. The 
pre-miR-381 sequence was amplified (forward primer: 
5′-CGTGAATGATAGTGAGGAAC-3′; reverse primer: 
5′-GTGAACGATTTGCCACACACA-3′) and introduced 
into the PLKO.3G vector. Lentiviruses containing pre-miR-
381 (miR-381) and negative control (miR-NC) were pro-
duced by GeneChem Company (Shanghai, People's Republic 
of China). Cells were cultured to approximately 70% conflu-
ence and then added by a concentration of 2.0×10 
5 TU/well 
lentiviruses containing pre-miR-381 or negative control, and 
RTq-PCR was performed to determine the expression levels 
of miR-381 after being infected for 7 days. </p>

<p>cell proliferation, invasion, and migration 
assays </p>

<p>Cell proliferation was examined by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-
yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Briefly, 
the cell lines were plated in 96-well plates (3,000 per well), 
and allowed to grow for 24, 48, and 72 hours, then assessed by 
a colorimetric assay using MTT solution (10 mg/mL) at 570 
nm. Cell invasion ability assay was performed using transwell 
invasion chambers coated with matrigel (BD Biosciences, San 
Jose, CA, USA). Cells were suspended in FBS-free medium 
and added to the upper chamber, while the medium containing 
10% FBS was added to the lower chamber. After 24 hours 
of incubation, the cells remaining on the upper membrane 
were removed with cotton wool, whereas the cells that had 
invaded through the membrane were stained with metha-
nol and 0.1% crystal violet, imaged, and counted using an 
inverted microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Cell migration 
ability was assessed by performing wound healing assays. 
Cells were cultured to 100% confluence, and wounds were 
generated using pipette tips. The cells were then cultured for 
24 or 48 hours and the wound closure was assessed by Scion 
Image Software (<rs id="software-0" type="software">Scion Image Beta</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">4.03</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Scion Corporation</rs>, 
Frederick, MD, USA). </p>

<p>luciferase reporter assays </p>

<p>The wild-type (WT) 3′UTR of Twist1 was amplified (for-
ward primer: 5′-TCAGAGGAACTATAAGAACACCT-3′; 
reverse primer: 5′-CAAGCAGGTATTTACCACCAACT-3′) 
and ligated into the psiCheck-2 reporter vector (Promega 
Corporation, Fitch-burg, WI, USA). Site-directed mutagen-
esis of the miR-381 seed sequence in the 3′UTR of Twist1 </p>

<p>(Mut) was performed using the QuikChange™ Site-Directed 
Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). Luciferase 
activity was detected using the dual luciferase assay (Promega) 
according to the manufacturer's protocols. Briefly, cells were 
cotransfected with 0.3 mg of the reporter vectors and 40 nM 
miR-381 mimics or scrambled mimics. Forty eight hours after 
transfection, the transfected cells were lysed and the relative 
luciferase activity was determined using a Modulus TD20/20 
Luminometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). 
All experiments were performed in triplicate. miR-381 and 
scramble mimics and corresponding inhibitors were purchased 
from RiboBio (Guangzhou, People's Republic of China). </p>

<p>Western blot analysis </p>

<p>Total cellular extracts were prepared using 200 mL of lysis 
buffer. Approximately 50 mg of total protein was separated 
by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electropho-
resis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride 
(PVDF) membrane, and incubated with the specific primary 
antibodies against E-cadherin, vimentin (Abgent Biotech-
nology, San Diego, CA, USA), N-cadherin (Cell Signaling 
Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), and β-actin (Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) overnight at 4°C. Then 
the membranes were washed with TBST (Tris-buffered saline 
with Tween-20), and probed with horseradish peroxidase 
(HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1,500 dilution; 
Santa Cruz) at 37°C for 30 minutes. Signals were visual-
ized using electrochemiluminescent (ECL) substrates (EMD 
Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). </p>

<p>statistical analysis </p>

<p>All statistical analyses were performed using the <rs id="software-3" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">19.0</rs> 
software (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">SPSS Inc.</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). Experimental 
data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). 
Statistical significance was analyzed using Student's t-test. 
The correlation between miR-381 and Twist1 expression was 
analyzed using Spearman's correlation analysis. P,0.05 was 
considered statistically significant. </p>

<p>Results 
Mir-381 is downregulated in crc

high TnM stages </p>

<p>The expression levels of miR-381 were evaluated by RTq-
PCR in a cohort of 113 CRC tumor tissues and 51 paired 
normal mucosal tissue. As shown in Figure 1A, miR-381 
expression was significantly decreased in CRC tumors 
compared with that in the paired normal mucosal tissue. </p>

<p>he et al </p>

<p>Correlation analysis revealed that miR-381 downregulation 
was significantly correlated with distant metastasis (P=0.007) 
and high TNM stages (P=0.035), while no significant correla-
tion was found in other clinicopathologic factors (Table 1). In 
addition, we also found miR-381 expression levels in CRC 
cell lines were significantly lower than that of the normal 
colonic cell line NCM460 (Figure 1B). Thus, our data sug-
gest that decreased miR-381 expression may be associated 
with CRC carcinogenesis. </p>

<p>Mir-381 inhibits the proliferation, 
invasion, and migration of crc cells </p>

<p>To investigate the functional roles of miR-381 in CRC cells, 
we constructed miR-381 expressing lentiviral vector and 
infected HT29 and SW480 cells. Overexpression of miR-381 
was validated by RTq-PCR (Figure 2A). MTT assays 
(Figure 2B), transwell with matrigel assays (Figure 2C), 
and wound healing assays (Figure 2D) showed that miR-381 
overexpression significantly inhibited cell proliferation, 
invasion, and migration ability of HT29 and SW480 cells. 
In contrast, when endogenous miR-381 was silenced with 
inhibitor mimics, cell proliferation, invasion, and migration 
ability was increased. These results suggest that miR-381 
may be a tumor suppressor gene in CRC cells. </p>

<p>Mir-381 directly inhibits Twist1 by 
targeting its 3′UTr </p>

<p>To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying inhibitory 
effects of miR-381 on proliferation, invasion, and migration 
of CRC cells, we predicted potential targets of miR-381. 
Using <rs type="software">TargetScan</rs> and <rs type="software">miRanda</rs> tools online, we screened 
several invasion-and migration-related genes by RTq-PCR, </p>

<p>of which Twist1 expression was significantly repressed in 
miR-381 expressing HT29 and SW480 cells. In addition, 
Twist1 is an important inducer of EMT, which is involved in 
cell invasion and migration ability, 
24,25 and hence we focused 
on Twist1 in the study. To validate if miR-381 directly targets 
Twist1 3′UTR (Figure 3A), luciferase reporter assays were 
performed in HT29 and SW480 cells, which revealed that 
miR-381 mimics significantly decreased the luciferase activ-
ity of wild-type Twist1 3′UTR reporter, but had no effect on 
the Twist1 3′UTR reporter with mutant miR-381 binding seed 
sites (Figure 3B). RTq-PCR and Western blot also validated 
that miR-381 mimics reduced Twist1 expression, and miR-
381 inhibitor mimics increased Twist1 expression in HT29 
and SW480 cells (Figure 3C and D). Moreover, RTq-PCR 
analysis revealed that Twist1 expression was significantly 
increased in CRC tumors compared with paired normal 
mucosal tissue (Figure 3E) and inversely correlated with the 
expression levels of miR-381 in CRC tissues used in the study 
(Figure 3F). Taken together, our results demonstrated that 
miR-381 directly inhibits Twist1 expression in CRC cells. </p>

<p>Twist1 attenuates the inhibitory effects

<p>We further examined whether Twist1 is a substantial target 
of miR-381 involved in regulating the migration and inva-
sion of CRC cells. Knockdown of Twist1 by specific siRNAs 
(Figure 4A) significantly attenuated the migration and invasion 
of HT29 and SW480 cells (Figure 4B), similar to the effects 
of miR-381 overexpression (Figure 2C and D). In addition, 
rescued Twist1 lacking its 3′UTR in the miR-381 expressing

<p>effects of miR-381 on the cell invasion and migration abil-
ity (Figure 4C). Of note, we found miR-381 significantly 
reversed EMT of HT29 and SW480 cells based on the obser-
vation that miR-381 increased epithelial marker (E-cadherin) 
and inhibited mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin and vimen-
tin) (Figure 4D), while in Twist1 rescue experiments, we 
found Twist1 was a substantial EMT inducer and remarkably 
attenuated the inhibitory effects of miR-381 on repression of 
EMT in HT29 and SW480 cells (Figure 4D). Taken together, 
our results demonstrated that Twist1 attenuates the inhibitory 
effects of miR-381 on the proliferation, invasion, migration, 
and EMT of CRC cells. </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>Increasing reports have demonstrated that miRNAs are an 
important regulator of tumor progression and metastasis. 
In CRC, many miRNAs have been identified to regulate 
known genes that are involved in the pathology of tumori-
genesis and metastasis. In the present study, we showed that 
miR-381 was significantly downregulated in a cohort of 113 
CRC and five CRC cell lines, which was consistent with a 
recently published report on miR-381 in colon cancer. 
23 In 
addition, we found decreased miR-381 expression was sig-
nificantly correlated with distant metastasis and high TNM 
stages. These findings suggest that miR-381 may function 
as a tumor suppressor in CRC. 
We then investigated the functional roles of miR-381 in 
CRC cell lines. To do so, we constructed miR-381 expressing 
HT29 and SW480 cells. MTT, transwell with matrigel, and 
wound healing assays revealed that miR-381 could inhibit 
cell proliferation, invasion, and migration ability of HT29 
and SW480 cells. Combined with the recent observation 
that miR-381 inhibited the cell proliferation and invasion in 
colon cancer, 
23 we concluded that miR-381 acts as a tumor 
suppressor in CRC. This was also consistent with previous 
findings that miR-381 suppressed breast, 
20 pituitary, 
21 and 
prostate cancers. 
22 However, another report revealed that 
high expression of miR-381 in gliomas was involved in 
pathological malignant progression, suggesting miR-381 as 
a tumor promoter in gliomas. 
26 All these observations sug-
gest that the role of miR-381 might vary in different types 
of cancer. 
We next predicted and validated the possible tar-
gets of miR-381 in CRC cells as the impact of specific 
miRNAs on cancer biology depends on their downstream 
targets. We found Twist1 was a direct target of miR-381 
by the luciferase reporter assay. To confirm the interaction 
of miR-381 and Twist1 in CRC, we performed RTq-PCR </p>

<p>on Twist1 expression in CRC tissues and found a signifi-
cant inverse correlation between their expression levels 
in clinical CRC. In addition, functional study revealed 
that Twist1 knockdown significantly inhibited the inva-
sion and migration ability of HT29 and SW480 cells, and 
rescued Twist1 in miR-381 expressing HT29 and SW480 
cells dramatically attenuated miR-381-induced inhibition 
on cellular migration and invasion. Taken together, our 
data suggest that Twist1 is a functional target of miR-381 
in CRC cells. 
EMT refers to the transformation of epithelial cells to 
mesenchymal cells, a key mechanism involved in the devel-
opment of many tumors, including CRC. 
15,27 EMT has been 
associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype including 
local invasion and distant metastasis. 
28,29 In the present study, 
we found miR-381 was significantly downregulated in CRC 
with distant metastasis and TNM stage (Table 1), suggesting 
miR-381 might be a regulator of EMT. This was validated 
by our observation that miR-381 increased epithelial marker 
E-cadherin and inhibited mesenchymal markers N-cadherin 
and vimentin. Moreover, this phenomenon was dramatically 
attenuated by rescued Twist1 in miR-381 expressing HT29 
and SW480 cells. These data suggest that miR-381 is a 
potential EMT inhibitor, at least partially, by targeting EMT 
inducer Twist1 in CRC cells. </p>

<p>Conclusion </p>

<p>In conclusion, our current findings revealed that miR-381 is 
downregulated in CRC and inhibits CRC invasion and migra-
tion by targeting Twist 1. These data suggest that restoration 
of miR-381 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the 
patients with CRC. </p>

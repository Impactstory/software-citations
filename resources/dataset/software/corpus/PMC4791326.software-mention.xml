<p>Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) recognizes viral double-stranded 
RNA. It stimulates pro-inflammatory cytokine and interferon 
production. Here we reported the expression of a novel iso-
form of TLR3 in human astrocyte cell lines whose message is 
generated by alternative splicing. The isoform represents the 
N-terminus of the protein. It lacks many of the leucine-rich re-
peat domains, the transmembrane domain, and the intra-
cellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain of TLR3. Type I in-
terferons (interferon- and interferon-) induced the expression 
of this isoform. Exogenous overexpression of this isoform in-
hibited interferon regulatory factor 3, signal transducers and 
activators of transcription 1, and Inhibitor of kappa B  signal-
ing following stimulation. This isoform of TLR3 also inhibited 
the production of chemokine interferon--inducible protein 10. 
Our study clearly demonstrated that the expression of this iso-
form of TLR3 was a negative regulator of signaling pathways 
and that it was inducible by type I interferons. We also found 
that this isoform could modulate inflammation in the brain. 
[BMB Reports 2015; 48(12): 696-701] </p>

<p>Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) is a pattern recognition receptor 
(PRR) that recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) during vi-
ral replication in endolysosomal compartments or on cell sur-
faces (1). Recognition of viral RNA by TLR3 triggers several in-
tracellular signaling pathways that lead to activation of mi-
togen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear factor B 
(NF-B), and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), resulting in 
the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I inter-
ferons (IFNs) (2, 3). TLR3 is expressed in various kinds of cells, 
including dendritic cells, fibroblasts, intestinal epithelial cells, 
and astrocytes. Depending on the cell type, TLR3 represents </p>

<p>different cellular response (4-6). Within distinct immunological 
milieu of the brain, TLR3 has been found to be necessary for 
the secretion of TNF-, IL-12p40, and IL-6 in murine micro-
glial cells after being stimulated by polyinosinic-polycytidylic 
acid (poly(I:C)) (7). In viral infections such as experimental in-
fection with simian immunodeficiency virus and human im-
munodeficiency virus encephalitis, TLR3 expression is upregu-
lated, leading to the induction of active innate immune re-
sponses in the brain (8). Following intracerebroventricular ad-
ministration of poly(I:C) to mimic viral infection in the central 
nervous system, TLR3 signaling is activated, resulting in con-
textual memory and enhanced susceptibility to seizures (9, 10). 
Similar effects of viral infection on brain function have been 
reported in encephalitis and associated epileptic activity (11-
13). These reports suggest that inflammation as innate immune 
response is important in neurological disorders and in anti-vi-
ral defenses. 
Astrocytes perform a variety of physiological functions such 
as forming the blood-brain barrier, transporting nutrients, and 
maintaining ion balances for the normal physiology of the 
brain. In addition, astrocytes play an important role in diseases 
related to neuro-inflammation (14, 15). Astrocytes express nu-
merous PRRs to allow for the recognition of diverse patho-
gen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (16-18). We have 
previously reported that TLR3 is expressed in astrocytes and 
that its activation induces the expression of IL-6 (19). We have 
reported that an isoform of TLR3 lacking 192 bp is produced 
by alternative splicing in primary astrocytes and astrocyte cell 
lines (20). However, the mechanistic role of this isoform is 
unclear. In this study, we report a novel isoform of TLR3 that is 
induced by type I IFNs in astrocyte cell lines. It downregulated 
poly(I:C)-induced TLR3 signaling. This isoform might have an 
immune-modulatory function during brain inflammation and 
other pathological conditions. </p>

primers (Fig. 1A, B). This isoform lacked the region of 966-
2,587 bp encoding a considerable number of the leucine rich 
repeat (LRR) domains, the transmembrane domain, and the in-
tracellular toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain responsible for signal 
transduction (Fig. 1C). The C-terminal 11 amino acids of this </p>

<p>TLR3 isoform differed from those of the TLR3 wild type as a re-
sult of a frame-shift introduced by alternative splicing. The al-
ternative splicing occurred between the donor "GT" (region of 
967-968 bp) and acceptor "AG" (region of 2,586-2,587 bp), in-
troducing a frame-shift mutation and a stop codon "TGA" at re-
gion of 2,621-2,623 bp, resulting in translation of a 299 amino 
acid polypeptide (Fig. 1D). </p>

and stimulated with 25 g/ml of poly 
(I:C) for the indicated time periods. Total 
cell lysates were analyzed by immuno-
blotting using anti-phospho-IRF3 (Ser396), 
anti-IRF-3, anti-phospho-IB (Ser32), an-
ti-IB, anti-phospho-STAT1 (Tyr701), or 
anti-tubulin antibody. The experiments 
were repeated twice and a representa-

<p>Upon viral infection, TLR3 will produce type I IFNs via activat-
ing IRF3. To assess the effect of type I IFNs on the transcription 
of the novel isoform of TLR3, A172 and NHA cells were treat-
ed with IFN- or IFN-. As a result, the transcription of this 
novel isoform of TLR3 was increased (Fig. 2A) after treatment 
with IFN- or IFN-. The transcript of this novel isoform of 
TLR3 was detectable starting at 3 h post treatment. Its level 
was increased until 24 h after IFN- treatment (Fig. 2B). </p>

<p>Next, we determined whether the expression of the novel </p>

ment induced phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 
(IRF3), Inhibitor of kappa B  (IB), and signal transducers 
and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) via TLR3 signaling in 
the control group (Fig. 3). When the isoform was exogenously 
overexpressed, phosphorylation levels of IRF3, IB, and 
STAT1 were significantly reduced compared to the mock trans-
fection control (Fig. 3). </p>

<p>Fig. 4. Poly(I:C)-induced secretion of IP-10 was decreased by ex-
ogenous expression of the novel isoform of TLR3 in a dose-de-
pendent manner. A172 cells were transiently transfected with pCMV-
Myc/TLR3 isoform (0.3-1.2 g), incubated for 24 h, and stimulated 
with 10 g/ml of poly(I:C) for 12 h. Mock vector was transfected 
at 0.3 g. Culture supernatants were harvested to measure the 
production of IP-10 by ELISA. Data represent mean ± S.E. *P ＜

ligation with poly(I:C), TLR3 stimulated IP-10 secretion via 
JAK/STAT pathway. Consistent with the inhibitory effect of 
TLR3 isoform expression on the activation of IRF3, IB, and 
STAT1 (Fig. 3), the production of IP-10 was decreased in a 
dose-dependent manner in cells exogenously overexpressing 
the TLR3 isoform (Fig. 4). </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>Endosomal TLRs such as TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 can recognize 
nucleic acids derived from viruses and bacteria. They play im-
portant roles in innate immunity as well as pathological con-
ditions (21). These TLRs can recognize self-DNA and RNA as-
sociated with several autoimmune diseases such as rheuma-
toid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and psoriasis (22, 
23). Normally, self-nucleic acids are not detected by endo-
somal TLRs because there are several regulatory mechanisms, 
including receptor localization, association with accessory pro-
teins, and proteolytic cleavage (24). For example, protease-
mediated regulation of TLR depends on the type of protease 
that is active. When TLR9 is cleaved by acidic pH-dependent 
protease such as cathepsins or asparagine endopeptidase, pro-
duced C-terminal cleaved fragments of TLR9 can augment 
TLR9 activation. On the other hand, when TLR9 is cleaved by 
neutral pH-dependent proteases, produced N-terminal frag-
ments of TLR9 can inhibit TLR9 signaling (25, 26). 
In the brain, TLR3 is abundantly expressed in microglia and 
astrocytes. TLR3 is active in anti-viral immune responses and 
some autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and ex-
perimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (27, 28). Recent </p>

<p>studies have shown that TLR3 cleavage by cysteine proteases 
will produce C-or N-terminal fragments that are involved in 
the activation of the receptor (29-31). 
In this study, we found a novel isoform of TLR3 generated 
by alternative splicing in astrocyte cell lines. This novel iso-
form has only LRRs 1-10. It lacks the entire transmembrane 
and cytoplasmic TIR domains. The expression of this isoform 
was induced by the treatment with type I IFNs. Interestingly, 
when the isoform was exogenously overexpressed, poly(I:C)-
induced TLR3 activation was significantly reduced. Moreover, 
the secretion of IFN-responsive chemokine IP-10 was decreased 
in cells overexpressing this isoform. These negative regulatory 
effects of this TLR3 isoform may be caused by competition for 
ligand binding because this TLR3 isoform has dsRNA binding 
sites (LRR1 and LRR3), whereas it lacks the cytoplasmic TIR 
domain required for signal transduction (25, 32). 
In summary, our results demonstrated that the expression of 
a novel isoform of TLR3 was induced by type I IFNs and that 
its protein product negatively regulated TLR3 activity. Therefore, 
this novel isoform of TLR3 might have immune-modulatory 
function in brain inflammation and some pathological condi-
tions. </p>

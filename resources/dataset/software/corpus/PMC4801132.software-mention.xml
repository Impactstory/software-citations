<p>Abstract: Bufei Jianpi formula (BJF) has long been used as a therapeutic agent in the treatment 
of COPD. Systems pharmacology identified 145 active compounds and 175 potential targets of 
BJF in a previous study. Additionally, BJF was previously shown to effectively prevent COPD 
and its comorbidities, such as ventricular hypertrophy, by inhibition of inflammatory cytokine 
production, matrix metalloproteinases expression, and other cytokine production, in vivo. 
However, the system-level mechanism of BJF for the treatment of COPD is still unclear. The aim 
of this study was to gain insight into its system-level mechanisms by integrating transcriptomics, 
proteomics, and metabolomics together with systems pharmacology datasets. Using molecular 
function, pathway, and network analyses, the genes and proteins regulated in COPD rats and 
BJF-treated rats could be mainly attributed to oxidoreductase activity, antioxidant activity, focal 
adhesion, tight junction, or adherens junction. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of systems 
pharmacology, transcript, protein, and metabolite datasets is performed. The results showed that 
a number of genes, proteins, metabolites regulated in BJF-treated rats and potential target pro-
teins of BJF were involved in lipid metabolism, cell junction, oxidative stress, and inflammatory 
response, which might be the system-level therapeutic mechanism of BJF treatment. 
COPD is a serious health problem characterized primarily by irreversible airflow limi-
tation and systemic inflammation, which represents a substantial economic burden in 
the world. 
1,2 Despite great progress in the treatment of COPD, drug therapies have not 
changed significantly. 
3 Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic drugs and strate-
gies to improve the efficacy in treating this deadly disease is still urgently needed. 
Bufei Jianpi formula (BJF), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has provided 
effective relief of symptoms in patients with COPD. Our clinical study demonstrated 
that BJF had extensive pharmacological effects on patients with COPD, such as alleviat-
ing the clinical symptoms of stable COPD, reducing the exacerbation frequency, delay-
ing acute exacerbation, and improving pulmonary function and exercise capacity. </p>

<p>therapeutic efficacies of each agent. 
5,6 In the previous 
study, we constructed a systems pharmacological model by 
combining active compound prediction, target prediction, 
and network pharmacology to clarify the active compounds 
and therapeutic mechanism of BJF. Systems pharmacology 
successfully identified 145 bioactive ingredients from BJF 
and predicted 175 potential targets of the active components 
contained in BJF. Moreover, we experimentally demon-
strated that BJF was effective for the treatment of COPD and 
ventricular hypertrophy due to its inhibitory effect on the 
inflammatory cytokine, and hypertrophic factors expression, 
protease-antiprotease imbalance, and collagen deposition, 
in vivo. 
7 Systems pharmacology, as an understanding of 
the function of the biological system, provided a system-
wide view of the therapeutic mechanism of BJF in treating 
COPD rats. However, we should provide more experimental 
evidences to validate the systems pharmacology predictions 
at system level. 
Transcriptomics-proteomics-metabolomics-profiling 
techniques provide holistic approaches to reveal the com-
plex biological processes and function of herbal compound 
recipe. 
8-10 Transcriptomics has been used in many in vivo 
studies to find the whole genome, which, however, cannot 
provide the details of the alternative splicing or even protein 
expression itself. Proteomics is a promising approach to 
directly study the expressed proteins and protein functions 
in a cellular context. Moreover, metabolomics provides the 
metabolic information, that is, the consequence of the tran-
scriptome and proteome. 
11 Thus, comprehensive analyses of 
the transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics datasets 
have the potential to provide a system view of the complex 
biological processes and function of herbal compounds. </p>

<p>We previously analyzed metabolite changes in lung

<p>In this study, we further analyzed the molecular effect of BJF 
on COPD rats using the datasets of transcripts and proteins 
derived from lung tissues. Finally, the aim of this study was 
to integrate systems pharmacology, transcriptomics, pro-
teomics, and metabolomics data streams, which provided a 
system picture of molecular mechanisms of BJF in treating 
COPD rats. </p>

Purified RNA was polymerase chain reaction amplified 
using a First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Hoffman-La Roche 
Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) and labeled using an Agilent Quick 
Amp Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). 
Then, RNA was hybridized with Agilent Whole Rat Genome 
Oligo Microarray (4×44 K) and washed. Finally, the slides 
were analyzed using an Agilent DNA microarray scanner 
(part number G2505B). 
The raw microarray data were further analyzed using 
<rs id="software-4" type="software">Agilent GeneSpring GX</rs> software <rs corresp="#software-4" type="version-number">version 11.0</rs>. Processed 
data were subsequently filtered for significant detection 
(Student's t-test screening, P,0.05) and differential expres-
sion versus COPD model rats (fold change, |log ratio| .1). </p>

<p>Protein expression analysis </p>

<p>Lung tissue protein was isolated from the three experimental 
groups. In each group, six rats were taken out for the analysis 
of protein expression. In brief, the lung tissues were lysed 
using the lysis buffer containing 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 
0.1 M dithiothreitol, and 0.1 M Tris pH 8.0 and homogenized 
in a mechanical homogenizer (Retsch Technology, Haan, 
Germany). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation and 
then stored at -80°C. 
For proteolytic digestion, trypsin (Hoffman-La Roche Ltd.) 
solution (protein/trypsin ratio 1:30) was added to the protein 
solution and incubated for 24 hours at 37°C. To label tryptic 
peptides with 8-plex iTRAQ labeling reagents (ABSciex, 
Darmstadt, Germany), each of the samples was reconstituted 
with isopropanol individually, and the labeling procedure was 
performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. 
For strong cation exchange fractionation, buffers A (10 mM 
KH 2 PO 4 in 25% acetonitrile [ACN] at pH 3) and B (10 mM 
KH 2 PO 4 and 2 M KCl in 25% ACN at pH 3) were used as the 
mobile phase. The peptide mixtures were dissolved in buffer A 
and then loaded onto a PolySULFOETHYL A column. Pep-
tides were fractionated using an 86-minute gradient from 0% 
to 100% of buffer B and monitored at optical density 214 nm. 
Fractions were collected every minute from the retention times 
of 8-58 minutes. Then, the fractions were dried, dissolved in 
0.1% formic acid (FA), and used for liquid chromatography-
mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. 
LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a nano liquid 
chromatograph (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) coupled online 
to a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker 
Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). For the LC-MS/MS analysis, 
water with 0.1% FA and ACN with 0.1% FA were used as the </p>

<p>mobile phase. The peptide sample was injected into a pulled 
tip column (15 cm ×100 μm inner diameter) containing C18 
Reprosil, 5 μm particles (Nikkyo Technos, Tokyo, Japan), 
and separated online using increasing amounts of acetonitrile 
containing 0.1% FA (mobile phase B) at 300 nL/min. Gradi-
ent conditions were as follows: 5%-34% B (0-25 minutes), 
34%-60% B (25-30 minutes), 80% B held for 4 minutes, 
and 5%-80% B (1 minute). 
The identification results were obtained from Mascot. 
The criteria used for protein quantitation were as follows: two 
unique peptide hits, two quantitative peptides, and disabling 
of outlier removal. The reporter ion ratio for each identified 
peptide was determined by <rs type="software">Mascot</rs>. The loess and global 
median normalization were used to process the proteom-
ics data. Data were log 2 transformed and analyzed on both 
peptide and protein level. Statistical significance of observed 
fold-change ratios was determined by one sample t-test. 
P-values ,0.05 were considered statistically significant for 
proteins. Fold change higher than 1.0 is for upregulation or 
lower than 1.0 is for downregulation. </p>

<p>treatment of COPD and ventricular hypertrophy due to its 
inhibitory effect on the inflammatory cytokine, and hyper-
trophic factors expression, protease-antiprotease imbalance 
and collagen deposition, in vivo. 
7 In this study, to investigate 
the system-wide mechanism of BJF in treating COPD rats, 
we further examined the effect of BJF on transcriptional 
profiles of lung tissues. 
Using microarray-based RNA expression analysis, we 
detected ~41,000 expressed genes in lung tissues. There 
were 2,463 and 1,012 genes differently expressed at COPD 
model (versus control) and BJF treatment (versus COPD 
model) rats, respectively (Tables S1 and S2). These tran-
scripts regulated in lung tissues of COPD model rats could 
be mapped to various molecular functions such as regulation 
of oxidoreductase activity, nucleic acid binding, channel 
activity, fatty acid binding, glucose, or fatty acid metabolism 
(Figure 1A). However, transcripts regulated only in BJF-
treated rats were mapped to several molecular functions, 
such as kinase binding, protein complex binding, and insulin 
receptor binding (Figure 1B). 
In addition, in the COPD model group, the regulated 
genes were mapped to many different pathways, such as fatty 
acid metabolism, valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, 
and propanoate metabolism (Table 1). The genes regulated 
in the BJF-treated group could be mapped to adherens junc-
tion, focal adhesion, endocytosis, wnt signaling pathway, 
etc. (Table 2). </p>

<p>Proteomics analysis results of BJF-treated 
COPD rats </p>

<p>To characterize the protein expression profiles of rats, 
expression levels of proteins were detected using LC-MS-
based proteomics. Comparing to those in healthy control 
rats, 192 proteins were identified in the COPD model rats 
(Table S3). After the treatment with BJF, comparing to 
those in the COPD model rats, 191 proteins were detected in 
BJF-treated rats (Table S4). The COPD rats (192 proteins) 
shared 100 common proteins with the BJF-treated rats (191 
proteins). Out of the 100 proteins, expression changes of 
42 proteins in the COPD model were inhibited by the BJF 
treatment (Table S5). These 42 proteins could be attributed 
to various molecular functions, such as oxidoreductase 
activity and antioxidant activity (peroxidase activity, cata-
lase activity, thioredoxin peroxidase activity; Figure 2A), 
which might be involved in the therapeutic mechanism of 
BJF in treating COPD. 
In addition, the 192 proteins regulated in COPD rats 
could be attributed to multiple molecular functions, including </p>

<p>phospholipase A2 inhibitor activity, peroxiredoxin activity, 
and oxidoreductase activity, acting on the aldehyde or oxo 
group of donors, etc. (Figure 2B). In the BJF-treated group, 
191 regulated proteins were mainly related to oxidoreductase 
activity, adrenergic receptor activity, receptor signaling 
protein activity, and extracellular ligand-gated ion channel 
activity (Figure 2C). 
In addition, the proteins regulated in COPD rats and 
BJF-treated rats were mapped to various pathways, such as 
focal adhesion, tight junction, adherens junction, and leuko-
cyte trans-endothelial migration (Tables 3 and 4). 
COPD is known to be accompanied by pulmonary inflam-
mation, oxidative stress, and muscle fiber dysfunction. </p>

<p>20,21 </p>

<p>These results suggested that BJF treatment could improve 
these COPD symptoms probably by regulating multiple 
molecular functions and pathways, such as oxidoreductase 
and antioxidant activity, focal adhesion, tight junction, 
adherens junction, and leukocyte trans-endothelial migra-
tion pathway. </p>

<p>holistic views on gene, protein, and 
metabolite data </p>

<p>In the previous study, we detected 49 and 30 metabolites 
regulated in the COPD model (versus control) and BJF-
treated (versus COPD model) groups, respectively. 
13 These 
metabolites were primarily involved in lipid metabolism 
(Figure 3A and B). In this study, a number of genes and 
proteins were identified, which deserve further attention to 
their system functions. Therefore, we further explored the 
system biological interpretation of the genes, proteins, and 
metabolites by integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and 
metabolomics data. 
Using the <rs type="software">Metscape</rs> software, we investigated the latent 
relationships of the metabolite, gene, and protein measure-
ments by constructing the correlation network diagram. 
As shown in Figure 4A and B, according to the transcriptom-
ics and metabolomics data of COPD rats and BJF-treated rats, 
we constructed two gene-metabolite networks, which were 
mainly related to lipid metabolism and purine metabolism. 
Interestingly, a number of genes and most of the metabo-
lites were involved in lipid metabolism. Subsequently, we 
constructed two protein-metabolite networks based on the 
metabolomics and proteomics data of COPD rats and BJF-
treated rats. As shown in Figure 4C and D, we observed that 
the protein-metabolite networks could be divided into two 
primary groups: lipid metabolism and purine metabolism, 
and more than half of proteins and almost all of metabolites 
were involved in lipid metabolism. </p>

<p>All of the abovementioned results indicated that lipid 
metabolism disorders might play a critical role in the COPD 
development and BJF intervention in a preclinical setting. 
To explore the system relationships of the transcript and 
protein measurements, we compared the significant pathways 
derived from transcriptomics and proteomics data of COPD 
rats, and identified three common pathways including fatty 
acid metabolism, propanoate metabolism, and valine, leucine, 
and isoleucine degradation (Tables 1 and 3). In addition, the 
transcripts and proteins regulated in BJF-treated rats were 
mapped into three common pathways: adherens junction, 
tight junction, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and dilated 
cardiomyopathy (Tables 2 and 4). </p>

<p>Integrating systems pharmacology, 
transcriptomics, proteomics, and 
metabolomics data </p>

<p>In the previous study, systems pharmacology successfully 
identified 175 targets of the active compounds contained 
in BJF. 
7 To investigate the system mechanism of BJF in 
treating COPD, we integrated transcriptomics, proteomics, 
and metabolomics data streams with systems pharmacology 
to provide a globe view of therapeutic mechanism of BJF 
treatment. </p>

<p>In this article, we first analyzed the overlapping proteins 
between the targets of BJF and transcript measurements of 
BJF-treated rats. As shown in Figure 5A, there were seven 
overlapping proteins (VEGFA, SLC6A2, ADRA2B, gyrB, 
CYCS, ampC, and katA) between them, which were asso-
ciated with various biological functions, such as vascular 
endothelial growth factor receptor 1 binding, chemoattractant 
activity, and G-protein-coupled amine receptor activity. 
Subsequently, we identified eleven overlapping proteins 
(GSTM1, GSTP1, CTSD, MPO, HSPA5, CAT, ampC, kata, 
XDH, SOD1, and gyrB) between the targets of BJF and 
proteomic measurements of BJF-treated rats. Interestingly, 
the molecular functions of eleven overlapping proteins were 
mainly related to oxidoreductase and antioxidant activity 
(Figure 5B). However, no overlapping pathways were 
detected between the potential targets and transcript/protein 
measurements of BJF-treated rats. Finally, we constructed a 
correlation network diagram to investigate the latent relation-
ships of the potential targets and metabolomics measurements 
of BJF-treated rats. In Figure 6, the results show that the 
network mainly consisted of lipid metabolism pathways. 
As discussed earlier, we constructed a system-level 
picture of the therapeutic mechanism of BJF by integrating 
systems pharmacology, transcript, protein, and metabolite 
datasets. As shown in Figure 7, the systems pharmacology 
targets and three-omics data were integrated, and the com-
prehensive picture was mainly consisted of four groups: 
lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, cell junction, and 
oxidative stress. In the previous study, we found that the 
expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor 
necrosis factor-α were significantly decreased by BJF treat-
ment. In addition, ERK, p38, JNK, and NF-κB were the 
potential targets of BJF. 
7 These results implied that BJF 
could achieve its ameliorative effect on COPD rats by sup-
pressing inflammatory responses. In this study, upon BJF 
treatment, arachidonic acid metabolism and linoleic acid 
metabolism were the significant deregulated pathways in 
lung tissues. In these pathways, the level of lecithin, linoleate, 
9-OXOODE, γ-linolenate, LXA4, LTB4, and PGE2 were 
suppressed by BJF treatment. Moreover, these metabolites, 
such as LXA4, LTB4, PGE2, and PGF2α, were involved 
in inflammatory processes in the airways of patients with 
COPD. 
22-25 In addition, according to the systems pharmacol-
ogy predictions, ALOX5 PTGS1/2, LTA4H, and AKR1C3, 
the important enzymes involved in these deregulated path-
ways were the potential targets of BJF. Therefore, the results 
indicated that BJF achieved its anti-inflammatory activity 
by suppressing the lipid metabolism and the production of 
pre-inflammatory cytokines. </p>

<p>The inflammatory responses associated with COPD 
are believed to be triggered by oxidative stress. 
26,27 In this 
study, we detected eleven overlapping proteins between the 
targets of BJF and proteomic measurements of BJF-treated 
rats, which were mainly involved in oxidative stress. </p>

<p>28 </p>

<p>For instance, the antioxidant proteins such as SOD1 and 
GSTP1 were involved in the pathogenesis of COPD, </p>

<p>29-31 </p>

<p>which were upregulated by BJF treatment. Additionally, </p>

<p>increased myeloperoxidase levels are associated with rapid 
lung function decline. 
32,33 In proteomic study, we found that 
the expression levels of myeloperoxidase were decreased by 
BJF treatment. These results suggested that BJF achieved 
its anti-inflammatory activity by regulating the oxidative 
stress status. 
Moreover, focal adhesion, the overlapping pathway 
among transcriptomic measurements, proteomic measure-
ments, and the potential targets of BJF were significantly 
regulated by BJF treatment (Table 5). For instance, FAK, 
PI3K, JNK, c-Jun, and ERK1/2, involved in the pathogenesis 
of COPD progression, 
34-36 were the potential targets of BJF. 
Overall, we demonstrated that BJF provided protec-
tive and therapeutic benefits against COPD by regulating 
multiple biological functions, such as lipid metabolism, 
oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and focal adhesion 
pathway. </p>

<p>Conclusion </p>

<p>Three-omics technologies have emerged as the promising 
tools to find the complex mechanism of TCM in the form 
of systems biology. 
37,38 Systems pharmacology is applied to 
conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic interac-
tions between the components of TCM and a biological 
system. Combining systems pharmacology, transcriptomics, 
proteomics, and metabolomics data is becoming more impor-
tant to detect the system-level therapeutic mechanism of 
TCM. However, attempts thus far to integrate system biology 
data streams have been met with limited success. 
In this study, we first characterized the transcriptomic and 
proteomic profiles of the lung tissues derived from COPD rats 
and BJF-treated rats. The regulated transcripts and proteins 
were attributed to multiple functions, such as oxidoreductase 
activity and antioxidant activity. The metabolomics profiles 
of the lung tissues were previously characterized, and the 
regulated metabolites were mainly involved in lipid metabo-
lism. Finally, we sought to obtain a comprehensive picture 
of systems pharmacology, transcriptomics, proteomics, and 
metabolomics data. The potential targets derived from systems 
pharmacology and three-omics data were integrated, and the 
system-level results indicated that BJF achieved its ameliora-
tive effect over COPD via mechanisms that might be dependent 
on its system-wide effects on lipid metabolism, inflammatory 
response, cell junction pathways, and oxidative stress. 
In summary, integrative application of systems phar-
macology, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome has 
potential implications toward understanding the system 
mechanism of action of TCM. </p>

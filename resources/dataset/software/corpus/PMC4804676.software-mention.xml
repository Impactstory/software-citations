<p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common life-
threatening inherited diseases with a prevalence of 
about 1 in 3500 live births. 1 Newborn screening (NBS) 
for CF has now been implemented in all the states in 
the United States and in many countries worldwide. 
Infants as young as 1 week of age with positive NBS 
for CF are routinely referred to accredited CF centers 
for sweat testing to confirm the diagnosis. 2,3 Sweat col-
lection requires sweat gland stimulation with pilocar-
pine iontophoresis and collection of sweat via Gibson 
and Cook technique (GCT) or Macroduct Sweat 
Collection System (MSCS; Wescor, Logan, UT). 2,4 For 
adequate sweat samples, the collected sweat must be 
≥75 mg (via GCT) or ≥15 µL (via MSCS). 2 Lower 
weights or volumes of sweat specimens cannot be ana-
lyzed and are labeled as "quantity not sufficient" 
(QNS). 3,4 One recent study compared the performance 
of the MSCS to the GCT in determining the sweat test-
ing QNS rate in infants with a positive CF NBS over a 
period of 4 years in Minnesota. 5 This report found a 
higher QNS rate using the GCT compared to the MSCS 
(15.4% vs 2.1% respectively). 5 </p>

<p>Younger infants are more likely to produce a higher 
QNS rate than older children. 6,7 Accordingly, infants 
with QNS samples need repeat testing, which leads to 
increased time to diagnosis, additional stress to the 
infants and their families, and an extra cost for testing. 8 
Currently, the cost of sweat testing is approximately 
$500 per test. The CF Foundation has placed a great 
importance on minimizing QNS rates and established 
several guidelines to standardize performance of sweat 
testing. The recommended QNS rate for children older 
than 3 months of age is ≤5%. 2,3 Since younger infants </p>

<p>Abstract 
Objective. Sweat collected for testing should have quantity not sufficient (QNS) rate of ≤10% in babies ≤3 months 
of age. Michigan (MI) cystic fibrosis (CF) centers' QNS rates were 12% to 25% in 2009. This project was initiated 
to reduce sweat QNS rates in MI. Methods/Steps. (a) Each center's sweat testing procedures were reviewed by a 
consultant. (b) Each center received a report with recommendations to improve QNS rates. (c) Technicians visited 
other participating centers to observe their procedures. Results. A total of 778 infants were identified as positive via 
CF newborn screening over a 2-year period. The mean age at time of sweat test was 23.2 days (SD ± 13.0 days). 
The overall QNS percent decreased from 14.4% to 9.5% (P = .04) during the study. Conclusion. This project and 
teamwork approach led to a decrease of sweat test QNS rates, opportunities to solve a common problem, and 
improved quality of care. </p>

<p>are being increasingly referred for sweat testing via the 
CF NBS programs, the CF Foundation added a standard 
stipulation of QNS rate ≤10% for patients ≤3 months of 
age, 3,4 a goal many centers struggle to meet. 
In Michigan, NBS for CF began in October 2007 
using an immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT)/DNA algo-
rithm. Blood spots from infants having an IRT concentra-
tion ≥96th percentile undergo further analysis with a 
panel of 40 CF gene mutations. Infants with one or more 
DNA mutations are referred to 1 of 5 CF Foundation-
accredited care centers in Michigan for confirmatory 
sweat testing. Three hundred and fifteen infants born in 
2008 underwent sweat testing at a mean age of 26 days. 9 
Of the 315 infants, 63 (20%) had QNS results, with the 
center-specific rates ranging from 12% to 30%. 9 A litera-
ture search comparing the QNS rates in Michigan to the 
QNS rates of other state NBS programs revealed only 2 
studies that listed QNS rates from a population of infants 
in the United States referred for confirmatory sweat test-
ing following a positive newborn screen. 3,7 Massachusetts 
reported the QNS rate ranged from 3% to 17% for sweat 
tests conducted during the first 8 weeks of life. 7 Illinois 
had a QNS rate of 10% with a median age at sweat test of 
22 days for those with sufficient tests and 17 days for 
those with insufficient tests. 3 LeGrys et al reported sum-
mary QNS rates for infants ≤3 months of age of 7% from 
a national survey of CF care centers and 8% from a sur-
vey of state leaders involved in NBS, though the site-
specific QNS rates displayed wide variability. 3 
Many reports have examined the association between 
specific characteristics and QNS results focusing either 
on a single infant characteristic or a combination of 
infant factors. 6,7,9-13 We previously conducted a study 
using a population-based cohort of all infants identified 
by NBS in Michigan and referred for confirmatory 
sweat testing to evaluate predictors of QNS rate and to 
devise a quality improvement (QI) strategy to reduce the 
QNS rate in neonates during confirmatory testing in 
order to meet the CF Foundation guidelines. 9 The study 
found that corrected age at the time of sweat test, defined 
by summing gestational age and postdelivery age at the 
time of test, should be considered when determining the 
appropriate time to perform a sweat test. As a result of 
this study, Michigan's NBS Program adjusted its CF 
algorithm to wait until infants screening positive for CF 
reach 39 weeks of corrected age prior to sweat testing in 
order to reduce the QNS rate. 9 
Our current QI study looked at different ways to 
reduce sweat testing QNS rate among infants ≤3 months 
of age. To our knowledge, this is the first population-
based cohort study to evaluate sweat testing QNS rates 
before and after implementation of several recommen-
dations for improvement. </p>

<p>Materials and Methods </p>

<p>Study Description </p>

<p>This population-based cohort study evaluated insuffi-
cient collected sweat samples in infants ≤3 months of 
age during NBS confirmatory testing for CF before and 
after implementing QI strategies. Four CF Foundation 
accredited care centers in Michigan participated directly 
in this QI study (Centers A-D). Each of the 4 participat-
ing CF centers reviewed its QNS rate and the sweat test-
ing procedure as outlined by the CF Foundation 
Guidelines. CF care centers in Michigan employ 2 dif-
ferent methods of sweat testing. One center uses GCT, 
whereas 3 centers use the MSCS. Both methods were 
equally recommended for appropriate collection of 
sweat samples from subjects of all age groups including 
newborns. 2 A clinical laboratory consultant with exper-
tise in sweat testing was invited to visit each center. The 
expert reviewed the sweat test procedure at each center 
and provided suggestions for improvement on tech-
niques, methods of collection, and analysis of the col-
lected sweat samples. A list of best practice 
recommendations from the expert was provided to the 
participating CF Care Centers to improve the sweat test-
ing techniques. The steps that were implemented by 
each center were noted, as well as the date implemented. 
Information from site visits at all 4 centers was col-
lected, and helpful steps in lowering QNS rates shared. </p>

<p>Centers Quality Improvement Process </p>

<p>In addition to the steps taken by all centers for this QI 
project, each center implemented additional measures 
when warranted based on individual needs. Center A 
had 2 site visits; one visit was prior to the start of the 
project and one was part of the project. </p>

<p>Study Population </p>

<p>The study population was restricted to newborns and 
infants who received a sweat test at 1 of the 4 participat-
ing CF Foundation-accredited care centers following a 
positive newborn screen for CF in Michigan. The popu-
lation was further restricted to infants with a sweat test 
performed in the 18 months before and after the site visit 
by the clinical laboratory consultant. Three of the 4 cen-
ters (B-D) had a site visit in October 2011, so newborns 
who received a sweat test from May 2010 through April 
2013 were included. The other center (A) had a site visit 
in December 2011, so newborns who received a sweat 
test from July 2010 through June 2013 were included. 
Last, only infants who received an initial sweat test ≤3 
months of age were included. </p>

<p>Processing and Data Storage </p>

<p>Initial NBS data, including the demographic and perinatal 
characteristics and IRT concentrations, are stored in a 
Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) cre-
ated by Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Inc. Confirmatory 
testing and medical management data are stored in a data-
base managed by the NBS Follow-up Program. To charac-
terize the population undergoing sweat testing, the 
following variables collected on the NBS filter paper were 
used in this study: birth weight, gestational age, race, and 
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission following 
birth. In addition, medical management data including CF 
care center, sweat test results, and age at time of sweat test 
were also used. Gestational age was dichotomized as &lt;39 
weeks and ≥39 weeks. Birth weight was also dichoto-
mized into &lt;2000 g or ≥2000 g. The 6-level race variable 
collected on the NBS filter paper was collapsed into white, 
black, and other. Age at time of sweat test was determined 
using the date of sweat test and birth date. The 2 sweat test 
result options were QNS or non-QNS. </p>

<p>Sweat Collection </p>

<p>All centers' sweat testing laboratories follow the Clinical 
and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines and are 
accredited by the CF Foundation. Centers A, C, and D 
used the Wescor Macroduct Sweat Collection System 
(Model 3700 SYS), and Center B used the Gibson-Cooke 
Sweat Test Apparatus (model IPS-25). Using the 
Macroduct system, CAP-certified technicians cleaned the 
area to be tested with water, inserted a new pilogel disc at 
each electrode, secured electrodes to the newborn's limb, 
and applied 1.5 A of current for 5 minutes. After removing 
the electrodes, the Macroduct sweat collection coil was 
secured to the area of the positive electrode for 30 minutes. 
If the sweat retention capacity of the coils was exceeded 
before 30 minutes, collection was stopped when the coils 
were full. When a patient did not produce a sweat sample 
of 15 µL, the attempt was counted as QNS. When using 
the Gibson-Cooke Apparatus, 2 electrodes were each cov-
ered by a 2 × 2 inch gauze pad soaked in 2 to 3 mL of 0.4% 
pilocarpine nitrate at the positive electrode, and a current 
of 2 to 3 mA was applied for 5 minutes. The area was 
cleaned and sweat was collected for 30 minutes on a 2 × 2 
inch gauze pad wrapped in evaporation-resistant film 
(Coban) over the area of the positive electrode. If the sam-
ple taken from the patient weighed less than 75 mg during 
that session, the attempt was counted as QNS. </p>

<p>Statistical Analysis </p>

<p>Data analysis was performed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 9.1</rs> 
(<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SAS Institute, Inc</rs>, Cary, NC). Chi-square tests were </p>

<p>used to determine the bivariate associations with sweat 
test outcome (QNS v. non-QNS) and the following vari-
ables: birth weight, gestational age, race, NICU admis-
sion, and CF care center. Chi-square or Fisher's exact 
tests were used to determine the associations between 
sweat test outcome in the 18-month periods before and 
after the site visit for all CF care centers combined and 
by center for all sweat tests performed and then sepa-
rately by NICU status. To allow for time for the recom-
mended changes to be implemented, QNS rates were 
determined for 2 time periods: 6 months after the visit 
and the subsequent 12 months. The average age at time 
of sweat test overall and by NICU status were calculated 
for each center, and t-tests were used to test for signifi-
cant differences in the 18-month period following the 
site visit compared to the 18-month period before the 
visit. An α value of .05 was used for this study. </p>

<p>Results </p>

<p>Overall, 778 infants were identified as screen positive 
for CF through the NBS Program and underwent sweat 
testing at the 4 participating Michigan CF care centers 
during the 18-month periods before and after the site 
visit (Table 1). Thirty-six infants received their initial 
sweat test &gt;3 months of age and were excluded, leaving 
a final study population of 742 infants. The mean age at 
time of sweat test was 23.2 days (SD +13.0) and median 
of 20 days. 
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics for all patients 
who received a sweat test in the 18 months before and 
after the site visit at each of the centers. The QNS percent 
significantly differed by gestational age, birth weight, 
NICU admission, and CF Care Center, but did not sig-
nificantly differ by race. The QNS percent was approxi-
mately 2 to 4 times greater among those who were &lt;39 
weeks or &lt;2000 g compared to their counterparts. Those 
admitted to the NICU were approximately twice as likely 
to experience a QNS result compared to those not admit-
ted to the NICU (22% QNS compared to 10.5%). 
The QNS rate was assessed 6 months following the 
expert's intervention and compared to the subsequent 12 
months (Figure 1). Two centers (B and D) had a lower 
QNS rate 6 months postintervention (6.7% and 9.1%) 
when compared to the QNS rate after another 12 months 
had passed (13.3% and 16.5%), one center (A) had an 
essential equivalent QNS rate 6 months postintervention 
(4.5%) compared to the rate after another 12 months 
(4.8%), and the remaining center (C) had a higher QNS 
rate 6 months postintervention (16.3%) when compared 
to the rate after another 12 months (6.6%). 
The months following implementation were con-
densed and reported as an 18-month period for statistical 
efficiency. Overall, the QNS percent decreased at 3 of </p>



<p>Global Pediatric Health </p>

<p>the 4 centers in the 18-month period following the site 
visit compared to the 18-month period before the site 
visit, though none of the center-specific decreases 
reached statistical significance (Table 2). One center 
experienced an increase in the QNS percent driven by 3 
infants with a QNS following the site visit compared to 
1 infant with a QNS prior to the site visit. For all 4 cen-
ters combined, the QNS percent decreased from 14.4% 
to 9.4%, and the decrease achieved statistical signifi-
cance (P = .04). 
When stratifying by NICU admission, the QNS per-
cent among all 4 centers combined decreased from 
27.1% to 15.4% for infants admitted to the NICU and 
from 12.5% to 8.9% for infants not admitted to the 
NICU, though neither decrease was statistically signifi-
cant (Table 2). Three of the 4 centers had fewer QNS 
results among NICU infants following the site visit and 
the fourth center remained the same. For non-NICU 
infants, 3 of the 4 centers had reduced QNS percentages 
in the 18-month period after the site visit compared to 
the 18 months before the visit. 
The average age at time of sweat test increased 
among NICU and non-NICU infants in the 18 months </p>

<p>following the site visit (Table 3), though the increases 
were not statistically significant, except for Center D 
with an average age of 16.7 days to 22.6 days. The aver-
age age at time of sweat test increased approximately 6 
days overall and 19.5 days among NICU infants in the 
18-month period after the site visit at Center D com-
pared to the 18-month period before the visit. </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter QI project 
aimed at lowering the sweat chloride QNS rate follow-
ing a positive CF newborn screen for babies ≤3 months 
of age. Michigan's multicenter participation provided 
the opportunity to assess a greater population and more 
diverse set of protocols. The overall QNS rate was sig-
nificantly reduced from 14.4% in the 18 months prior to 
the site visits by a clinical laboratory expert to 9.5% in 
the 18 months following the visits. Reducing the QNS 
sweat testing rate is important not only to adhere to the 
CF Foundation guidelines 3,4 but also to expedite com-
pletion of the screening process, thereby reducing asso-
ciated parental anxiety and confusion regarding results. 14 </p>

<p>In our study, all but one CF center joined together in a 
transparent fashion to work on a common problem. This 
collaborative effort was possible due to willing collabora-
tion that led to strengthening relationships between cen-
ters and their personnel through the benchmark intercenter 
site visits. Consistent with prior work by LeGrys, which 
revealed a very wide range of QNS rate of 0% to 40% in 
infants &lt;3 months of age referred after NBS, 3 our site-
specific QNS rates ranged from 2.9% to 24.7% in the 18 
months prior to the site visits. In this study, there was sig-
nificant reduction of QNS rate in Michigan following 
implementation of the project. Although overall, each 
center lowered its QNS rate, not all center-specific rates 
were below the CF Foundation recommended rate of 10% 
or lower, indicating the need for continuous improvement 
efforts. After the end of the project, only center D's QNS 
rate remained higher than the recommended QNS rate, 
but this center has made considerable improvement from 
its initial QNS rate of 24.7% at the beginning of the study. 
Three of the 4 centers did not include analysis of 
QNS rate by technician performing the test similar to 
Boas et al. 15 However, we were able to identify common 
problems between centers, which were addressed 
through conference calls and site visits. The sweat test-
ing procedure was reviewed at every visit and necessary 
changes were implemented. For center B, review of the 
sweat testing process was done with the laboratory per-
sonnel and procedural changes were made accordingly. 
In addition, parents were contacted prior to testing to 
ensure babies are well hydrated prior to testing. Center 
C tracked the individual technician's performance in the 
collection and analysis of the sweat testing samples. 
QNS rate per technician was reviewed weekly and any 
deficiencies in training were addressed. Also, parents 
were contacted prior to testing to ensure babies were 
well hydrated prior to testing. Center D established 
monthly meetings between the laboratory staff and the 
CF team members to improve communication and 
address any deficiencies. One center (center C) did 
internal analysis of QNS rate by technician. Weekly 
review of the data to address any deficiency identified 
was done. In addition, specific problems within each 
center were identified and addressed at the center level. 
The second step in our QI project provided a unique 
opportunity for direct observation, discourse, and edu-
cation among center personnel directly involved in 
sweat test procedures. All participating center personnel 
provided positive commentary on the value of this sec-
ond step, in particular, the opportunity to witness first-
hand the process in different centers and gain insight on 
approaches that may be adapted or refined in their own 
centers. We believe this collaborative interaction was 
instrumental in reducing the QNS rate. </p>

<p>Our data suggest the need for continued collaboration 
and monitoring, in particular, when one compares the 
QNS rate 6 months postintervention with the subsequent 
12 months. We initially assessed this difference to deter-
mine if there was a lag in QNS improvement to allow for 
staff training and implementation of recommendations. 
This was apparent with one center, but we noted in 2 
centers the QNS rate was better at 6 months postinter-
vention when compared to the subsequent 12 months. 
This may reflect a greater emphasis on recommenda-
tions for improvement that waned over time with regres-
sion back to prior standards/practice; thus, continued 
discussion among CF Center staff and review of recom-
mendations for improvement may be needed. 
NICU infants were assessed independently from non-
NICU infants because of their underlying medical condi-
tion or prematurity requiring NICU admission, potentially 
confounding the increased rate of QNS. In the past, it 
was noted that NICU infants with ultrahigh IRT and no 
mutations did not have a final diagnosis of CF. After our 
analysis in 2009, Michigan babies with ultrahigh IRT and 
no mutations were not considered screen positive for 
CF. 16 Ultrahigh IRT infants were not included in this 
cohort; thus, they did not affect our results. 
This project was challenging because it included sev-
eral centers with different problems/issues in relation to 
the sweat testing process. Another challenge was orga-
nizing the site visits between centers. A third challenge 
was the data collection and sharing of the QI steps in 
each center. These challenges required a significant 
degree of collaboration and transparency between cen-
ters. Center C played a leading role in organizing the 
technicians' visits to all the participating centers, which 
took several months to accomplish. In addition, 2 medi-
cal students at center C assisted in data collection and 
documentation of changes made by participating centers 
and information exchanged between all the technicians 
who took part in the project. 
In conclusion, this QI project led to collaboration and 
coordination between the CF centers in Michigan and 
resulted in the reduction of the overall QNS rate for all 
participating centers. We believe this will positively 
affect the parental experience by reducing their anxiety 
and confusion over the testing process, which is the ulti-
mate indicator of success. The multicenter collaboration 
is continuing today and leading to other QI projects 
between centers. </p>

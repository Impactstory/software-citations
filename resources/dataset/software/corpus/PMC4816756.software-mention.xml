<p>Background: The major gene mutated in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease was first identified over 
20 years ago, yet its function remains poorly understood. We have used a systems-based approach to examine 
the effects of acquired loss of Pkd1 in adult mouse kidney as it transitions from normal to cystic state. 
Methods: We performed transcriptional profiling of a large set of male and female kidneys, along with metabolo-
mics and lipidomics analyses of a subset of male kidneys. We also assessed the effects of a modest diet change on 
cyst progression in young cystic mice. Fatty acid oxidation and glycolytic rates were measured in five control and 
mutant pairs of epithelial cells. 
Results: We find that females have a significantly less severe kidney phenotype and correlate this protection with 
differences in lipid metabolism. We show that sex is a major determinant of the transcriptional profile of mouse 
kidneys and that some of this difference is due to genes involved in lipid metabolism. Pkd1 mutant mice have 
transcriptional profiles consistent with changes in lipid metabolism and distinct metabolite and complex lipid 
profiles in kidneys. We also show that cells lacking Pkd1 have an intrinsic fatty acid oxidation defect and that 
manipulation of lipid content of mouse chow modifies cystic disease. 
Interpretation: Our results suggest PKD could be a disease of altered cellular metabolism.

<p>Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD; MIM ID's 
173900, 601313, 613095) is estimated to affect almost 1/1000 and is 
the most common genetic cause of end stage renal disease (Torres 
et al., 2007). While advances have been made in slowing the progres-
sion of some other forms of chronic kidney disease, standard treatments 
have not reduced the need for renal replacement therapy in ADPKD 
(Spithoven et al., 2014). Unfortunately, several experimental interven-
tions also have recently failed to show significant benefit in slowing 
the rate of functional decline (Serra et al., 2010; Walz et al., 2010; 
Schrier et al., 2014; Torres et al., 2014), and the only positive study 
reported very modest effects (Torres et al., 2012). These findings 
suggest new treatment strategies are required. 
A central dogma of molecular genetics is that discovery of the 
causative genes will lead to identification of key pathways and potential 
targets for intervention. In the case of ADPKD, the two genes mutated in 
the disorder, PKD1 and PKD2, were identified almost 20 years ago and 
yet their functions remain poorly understood. The PKD1 gene product, 
polycystin-1 (PC1), encodes a large membrane protein that requires 
the PKD2 gene product, polycystin-2 (PC2), for its trafficking to the </p>

<p>primary cilium where the two are thought to form a receptor channel 
complex (Kim et al., 2014; Cai et al., 2014). What the complex senses 
and what it signals remains controversial. The primary cilium has 
emerged as a key player in the pathogenesis of PKD as mutations in 
dozens of different genes that encode either essential ciliary compo-
nents or factors in ciliary signaling pathways result in PKD. A recent 
report suggests that the relationship between the polycystin complex 
and ciliary signaling is complicated, however. While ablation of primary 
cilia by mutation of core ciliary components results in cysts, these same 
perturbations done in the setting of Pkd1 or Pkd2 inactivation results in 
significant attenuation of cystic disease (Ma et al., 2013). These data 
suggest that the polycystin complex provides a suppressive signal for 
a novel, cilia-dependent growth-promoting pathway that is indepen-
dent of MAPK/ERK, mTOR, or cAMP pathways, three effector pathways 
previously implicated as major drivers of cyst growth. The identities 
of the growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting pathways remain 
unknown. 
We have taken a systems-based approach to study Pkd1 gene 
function. Building on our previous work identifying markedly different 
outcomes in animals with induced Pkd1 inactivation before or after 
P12 and correlating this susceptibility with metabolic status (Piontek 
et al., 2007; Menezes et al., 2012), we now show that female sex is 
partially protective in adult-induced Pkd1 inactivation, that sex differ-
ences in metabolic status may account for this effect, and that cells </p>

<p>lacking Pkd1 have abnormal fatty acid oxidation. Finally, manipulating 
diet in Pkd1 mouse models, we demonstrate a positive correlation 
between lipid content in mouse chow and cystic kidney disease severi-
ty. Our results therefore suggest that abnormal lipid metabolism is an 
intrinsic component of PKD and an important modifier of disease 
progression. </p>

<p>2. Materials and Methods </p>

<p>2.1. Ethics Statement </p>

<p>All studies were performed using protocols approved by NIH Animal 
Care and Use Committee, and mice were kept and cared in pathogen-
free animal facilities accredited by the American Association for the 
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and meet federal (NIH) guide-
lines for the humane and appropriate care of laboratory animal. </p>

<p>2.2. Animal Studies </p>

<p>Fifth-generation C57/BL6 Pkd1 
tm2Ggg (Piontek et al., 2004) mice were </p>

<p>crossed to the reporter mice C57/BL6 congenic B6.129S4-
Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1Sor/J (stock 003474, Jackson Laboratories) and to 
C57/BL6 tamoxifen-Cre (B6.Cg-Tg(Cre/Esr1)5Amc/J mice (stock 
004682), Jackson Laboratories) or Ksp-Cre B6.Cg-Tg(Cdh16-cre)91Igr/ 
J(stock 012237), Jackson Laboratories). For early-onset diet studies 
in tamoxifen-Cre mice, nursing moms of P7 mice were induced by 
one intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 mg/g tamoxifen (Sigma, T5648) in 
corn oil (Sigma-Aldrich, C8267) and pups were harvested at P21. In 
the Ksp-Cre line, mice were harvested at P14. In both studies, breeding 
pairs and offspring were continually fed with either NIH31 or NIH37 
diets for the duration of the study. For the late-onset studies, adult 
mice were induced at P40 by one intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 mg/g 
tamoxifen in corn oil and harvested between P86 and P210. Induced, 
tamoxifen-cre negative, Pkd1 
tm2Ggg (referred to as Pkd1 
cko/cko in this </p>

<p>report) mice were considered controls. </p>

<p>2.3. Cell Lines </p>

<p>Kidneys from two Pkd1 
cko/cko animals (121112-C: male, bP12; and </p>

<p>94414: male, P463) were harvested, minced and digested using a 
collagenase/hyaluronidase solution (Stemcell technologies, cat. no. 
07912) followed by proximal or collecting/distal tubule cell enrichment 
using, respectively, biotinylated Lotus tetragonolobus Lectin (LTL) 
(Vector Laboratories, cat. no. B-1325) or biotinylated Dolichos biflorus 
Agglutinin (DBA) (Vector Laboratories, ca. no. B-1035) and Cellection 
Biotin Binder kit (ThermoFischer, cat. no. 11533D). Cells were immor-
talized using the large T antigen (Addgene plasmid no. 22298). Pkd1 
was conditionally inactivated using cre recombinase (121112C-LTL 
cells; Excellgen, cat. no. EG-1001) or viral transduction (121112-C 
DBA and 94414-LTL/DBA cells) using LV-Cre (Addgene plasmid no. 
12106). At the time of inactivation, a corresponding control was gener-
ated using viral transduction with plasmid LV-Lac (Addgene plasmid no. 
12108). Pkd1 inactivation was confirmed using genomic PCR and/or 
reverse-transcriptase PCR (TaqMan gene expression assay, Applied 
Biosystems, cat. no. 4351372, Mm00465436_g1). mCCDcl1 (mCCD) 
cells were a kind gift from the Rossier lab (Gaeggeler et al., 2005). 
mCCD Pkd1 knock-down cells were generated using viral transduction 
with the shRNA clone TRCN0000072085 and the corresponding 
pLKO.1 TRC21 control (Addgene plasmid 10,879). Cells were grown in 
DMEM/F12 media (Life cat. no. 21041-025) with 2% FBS (GEMINI Bio-
Products cat. no. 100-106), 1X Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 41400-045), 5 uM dexamethasone (SIGMA, 
cat. no. D1756), 10 ng/ml EGF (SIGMA, cat. no. SRP3196), 1 nM 3,3′,5-
Triiodo-L-thyronine (SIGMA, cat. no. T6397) and 10 mM HEPES 
(CORNING, cat. no. 25-060-CI). </p>

<p>Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were obtained from E12.5 and 
E13.5 Pkd1 knockout (Pkd1 
tm1GGG (Bhunia et al., 2002)) and control </p>

<p>mice. Briefly, whole embryos were minced, washed in PBS and cultured 
in six-well tissue culture plate in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium 
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). A total of 6 
MEF lines was used for this study: three from E13.5 mouse littermates 
(2 Pkd1 
ko/ko and 1 Pkd1 
wt/wt ) immortalized using large T antigen </p>

<p>(Addgene plasmid no. 22,298) and an additional set of three primary 
(passage 2, non immortalized) E12.5 embryos (1 Pkd1 
ko/ko and 2 
Pkd1 
wt/wt littermate controls). </p>

<p>2.4. Phenotypic Characterization </p>

<p>Kidneys and body weight were measured and the mean kidney/ 
body weight ratio was the readout for disease severity. The left kidney 
was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, centrally sectioned along the longi-
tudinal axis and processed for histology. The right kidney was snap 
frozen in liquid nitrogen. </p>

<p>2.5. mRNA Expression Studies </p>

<p>Eighty mouse kidneys with induced deletion of Pkd1 at P40 were 
harvested between 102 and 210 days of age (14 control females, 21 
mutant females, 19 control males and 26 mutant males). Total RNA 
was isolated using Trizol (Life, cat. no. 15596-018) followed by RNeasy 
plus kit (Qiagen, cat. no. 74136). Further sample processing for microar-
ray analysis was performed by the University of Chicago Genomics 
Facility, Knapp Center for Biomedical Discovery, following the facility's 
protocols, and hybridized to Illumina's MouseRef-8 v2.0 BeadChip 
expression arrays. These data have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Ex-
pression Omnibus (Edgar et al., 2002) and are accessible through GEO 
Series accession number GSE72554 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ 
geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE72554). 
For RT-PCR, cDNA was generated using Superscript Vilo (Life, cat. 
no. 11755050) amplified with the expression assay Mm00465436_g1 
(TaqMan gene expression assay, Applied Biosystems, cat. no. 
4351372), normalized to Gapdh and analyzed using the delta-delta-Ct 
method. Each sample was analyzed in 2 independent experiments, 
each done with 3 or 4 replicates. </p>

<p>2.6. Statistical Analysis </p>

<p>Comparison of kidney/body weight (KBW) mutant male vs. female 
curves was performed using generalized linear model in R (Team, 
2014) and the effect size was estimated calculating Cohen's d with the 
<rs type="software">compute.es</rs> package in R. Analysis of KBW in mutants fed NIH31 or 
NIH37 was done using Student's t test. Real time PCR data was analyzed 
fitting an anova model including within subject error. Fatty acid 
oxidation assay results for five technical (well) replicates were averaged 
for each cell line and genotype. The corresponding five pairs of means 
were analyzed using paired t-test. </p>

<p>2.7. Gene Array Expression Analyses </p>

<p>Raw Illumina gene expression data were processed using variance 
stabilization and quantile normalization with the lumi package (Du 
et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2008) in R (Team, 2014), filtered to include only 
probes with detection call p value b0.05 in at least seven of the arrays, 
followed by batch-removal using COMBAT (Johnson et al., 2007). 
Same-gene probes were consolidated to a single identifier keeping the 
probe with highest mean value. Detection of differentially expressed 
genes was performed using linear models and empirical Bayes methods 
implemented in the limma package (Smyth, 2004) in R. For time course 
analysis, <rs type="software">splines</rs> and <rs type="software">limma</rs> packages in R were used to fit separate 
curves in mutant males and females for each gene, and then the param-
eters corresponding to the interaction of time and sex were evaluated to </p>

<p> 
L.F. Menezes et al. / EBioMedicine 5 (2016) 183-192 </p>

<p>identify genes with different temporal profile. Comparisons between 
mutant and control within sex were done in limma analyzing contrasts 
comparing samples collected at three different time intervals. Genes 
with fdr-p b 0.05 were considered differentially expressed. 
The published gene expression dataset GSE25506 was downloaded 
from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository (http://www. 
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Data were restricted to 706 mouse kidney 
cortex or medulla samples and analyzed for differential expression 
comparing sexual differences within anatomic region using the limma 
package (Smyth, 2004) in R. Genes with fdr-p b 0.05 in both cortex 
and medulla were considered differentially expressed. Comparisons 
of overlap between sexual differences in the current dataset and 
GSE25506 were done after restricting the datasets to only genes 
expressed in both. </p>

<p>2.8. Network and Pathway Analysis </p>

<p>Weighted Gene Co-expression Network and Pathway Analysis was 
performed using the <rs id="software-22" type="software">WGCNA</rs> R package (<rs corresp="#software-22" type="creator">Langfelder and Horvath</rs>, 
2008) with soft thresholding powers selected based on the approximate 
scale-free topology criterion (Zhang and Horvath, 2005), followed by 
blockwise network construction, module detection, correlation with 
sex/genotype and comparative network analysis to determine module 
preservation. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of the identified 
modules and lists of differentially expressed genes was performed in R 
using GOstats (Falcon and Gentleman, 2007). </p>

<p>2.9. Metabolomics and Lipidomics </p>

<p>Kidney samples were submitted to the West Coast Metabolomics 
Center, at University of California, Davis, and processed according to 
the facility's protocols. Briefly, lipidomics workflow involves sample 
extraction in MTBE with addition of internal standards, followed by 
ultra high pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) on a Waters CSH 
column, interfaced to a QTOF mass spectrometer (performed using an 
Agilent 1290 Infinity LC system (G4220A binary pump, G4226A 
autosampler, and G1316C Column Thermostat) coupled to either an 
Agilent 6530 (positive ion mode) or an Agilent 6550 mass spectrometer 
equipped with an ion funnel (iFunnel) (negative ion mode)), with a 
15 min total run time. Data were collected in both positive and negative 
ion mode, and analyzed using <rs id="software-25" type="software">MassHunter</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-25" type="creator">Agilent</rs>) to assign a unique 
ID to each lipid based on its retention time and exact mass (RT_mz). For 
GC-TOF, samples were prepared and analyzed using Gerstel CIS4 -with 
dual MPS Injector, Agilent 6890 GC and Pegasus III TOF MS, as described 
in (Fiehn et al., 2008). 
Analysis was performed in R (Team, 2014). Data were log2-
transformed and centered using Pareto scaling (van den Berg et al., 
2006). Exploratory data analysis was conducted using principal compo-
nent analysis. The Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used to identify 
metabolites that were normally distributed, which were then analyzed 
for differential detection using linear models and empirical Bayes 
methods (Smyth, 2004). Non-normally distributed metabolites were 
analyzed using Wilcoxon test, followed by fdr-correction of p-values. 
Metabolites with 2 fold increase/decrease and adjusted p-value b 0.05 
were considered differentially expressed. </p>

<p>2.10. Fatty Acid Oxidation and Glycolysis Assays </p>

<p>A Seahorse Bioscience XF24 extracellular flux analyzer and reagents 
were used to infer fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and glycolysis in cells by 
measuring oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and extracellular acidifica-
tion rate (ECAR) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, for 
the FAO assay, 48 h prior to the assay, 30,000 cells/well were seeded, 
allowed to grow overnight and then starved for 24 h with substrate-
limited medium. The cells were re-fed with either XF Palmitate-BSA or 
XF Control-BS and OCR was measured at baseline and after the addition </p>

<p>of 1.5 μM Oligomycin, 0.8 μM FCCP, 1.6uM FCCP and and 2 μM 
rotennone/4 μM antimycin A. For the glycolysis assay, 60,000 cells/ 
well were seeded 24 h prior to the assay on a XF24 Cell culture micro-
plate in DMEM with 10% FBS. The medium was switched to glycolysis 
assay medium (2 mM Glutamine in Seahorse Base Medium, pH 7.4) 
and cells were incubated for 1 h in a non-CO 2 37°C incubator. OCR and 
ECAR were then measured at baseline and after sequential addition of 
10 mM glucose, 1 μM oligomycin, and 50 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG). </p>

<p>3. Results </p>

<p>3.1. Kidney Cystic Disease Progression is Slower in Adult Female Mice </p>

<p>Analysis of covariance in mutant mice fitting kidney/body weight 
ratio (KBW) to age and using sex as a categorical factor showed that 
age correlates with increased KBW (p b 0.001; n = 31 control females, 
33 mutant females, 32 control males, 39 mutant males), and sex is a 
modifier of the rate of cyst growth (p b 0.001; Cohen's d = 1.03) 
resulting in 66% to 167% increase in mutant male KBW (compared to 
mutant females) (Fig. 1a), an effect not explained by differences in dele-
tion rates (Supplementary Figure S1). In contrast, liver cysts showed the 
opposite trend: males have approximately 4% to 37% lower liver/body 
weight ratio (LBW) (p b 0.05; Supplementary Figure S1). </p>

<p>3.2. Gene Expression in Kidneys is Sexually Dimorphic </p>

<p>Unbiased global gene expression microarray data using multidimen-
sional scaling (MDS) showed that in eighty mouse kidneys between 102 
and 210 days of age (14 control females, 21 mutant females, 19 control 
males and 26 mutant males) mutant and control kidneys clustered 
separately and their dissimilarities correlated with worsening of the 
phenotype (Fig. 1b). While this is perhaps to be expected, we were 
surprised to find that control kidneys were clustered in separate male 
and female groups. In fact, roughly the same number of genes was dif-
ferentially expressed between control male and female kidneys 
(3502) as between all mutant and control male samples (3721; Fig. 
1c). To verify if these transcriptional sex differences were present 
in other kidney datasets, we identified a large published dataset 
(GSE25506 (Derry et al., 2010)) including 706 control kidney samples. 
Comparing male and female kidneys in this set, we again detected 
differential expression in approximately 60% of the expressed genes 
(Figure S2), strongly suggesting that in mice kidney gene expression 
patterns are sexually determined. </p>

<p>3.3. Gene Networks and Disease Mechanisms are Likely Preserved Between 
Sexes </p>

<p>Cystogenesis could be delayed in females because different path-
ways are responsible for disease in males and females, or because path-
ways are activated to different degrees. Using WGCNA (Langfelder and 
Horvath, 2008) to cluster co-expressed genes into modules and track 
changes in co-expression patterns in males and females, our data 
suggest networks are mostly preserved between wild type males and 
females and, in fact, between all genotype/sex groups (Supplementary 
Figure S3). Furthermore, it summarized genes that have distinct sex 
patterns in two "meta-modules" (i.e. clusters of highly correlated 
modules) which have among their significantly enriched gene ontology 
categories biological processes related to metabolic and lipid pathways 
(Fig. 1d and S4; and Supplementary Table 1). 
Protection in females is therefore likely derived from increased/ 
decreased activity of conserved functional gene clusters. Comparing 
three different disease stages (pre-cystic: P100-P139; cystic: P140-
P190 and severely cystic: P190-P210) we identified hundreds of dif-
ferentially expressed genes and confirmed that many differences be-
come significant as disease progresses, few are unique to one sex, 
and in cystic samples the percentage of genes that are differentially </p>

<p> 
L.F. Menezes et al. / EBioMedicine 5 (2016) 183-192 </p>

<p>expressed in both males and females increases (Fig. 1, e and f). This 
suggests that progression mechanisms are similar in males and fe-
males, just retarded in the latter. Gene ontology of differentially </p>

<p>expressed genes (Supplementary Table 2), in agreement with previ-
ous findings (Menezes et al., 2012; Rowe et al., 2013), suggests that 
metabolic pathways are dysregulated, including lipid (p = 9.13E-</p>

<p> 
L.F. Menezes et al. / EBioMedicine 5 (2016) 183-192 </p>

<p>06) and fatty acid (1.28E-05) metabolism. Other notable categories 
include inflammation and cell locomotion/adhesion. 
Our data thus showed that disease mechanisms are similar in males 
and females and that lipid metabolic pathways are likely dysregulated 
in mutant kidneys and different between control females and males. 
We therefore hypothesized that altered lipid metabolism could be an 
intrinsic component of PKD, perhaps underlying the protection seen in 
females. </p>

<p>3.4. Metabolite and Complex Lipids Profiling Confirm Global Metabolic 
Differences in Mutant Kidneys </p>

<p>Metabolomics and lipidomics of 14 male kidney samples (8 mutant) 
confirmed that mutant kidneys have distinct metabolic profiles, partic-
ularly in more cystic stages, as shown in principal component analysis 
(PCA) plots (Fig. 2, a and b). While several compounds had more than 
2-fold change, only seven metabolites and one lipid (diacylglycerol 
(38:6)) reached statistical significance (Fig. 2c and Supplementary 
Table 3). The small number of statistically significant changes likely 
reflects the mostly normal profiles of pre-cystic samples. In fact, even 
the metabolites with different concentration were more highly correlat-
ed with KBW (mean correlation: 0.88; Fig. 2d) than with genotype 
(mean correlation: 0.62), the exception being diacylglycerol (correla-
tion with KBW: −0.48; with genotype: −0.70). </p>

<p>3.5. Fatty Acid Oxidation is Defective in Mutant Epithelial Cells </p>

<p>We next tested fatty acid oxidation in vitro. We isolated and 
immortalized cell lines enriched in either proximal or distal tubes 
from two Pkd1 conditional mice and subsequently inactivated Pkd1 
using lentiviral cre expression or cre recombinase delivery. In addition, 
we used shRNA to knock-down Pkd1 in a mouse collecting duct cell line 
(mCCD (Gaeggeler et al., 2005)). Measuring oxygen consumption rate 
(OCR) with an extracellular flux analyzer, we showed that in five differ-
ent epithelial cell lines Pkd1 inactivation resulted in lower fatty acid 
oxidation (n = 5 pairs, p-value = 0.0001367; Fig. 3, a and b). Changes 
in glycolysis were not observed (Fig. 3, c and d, and Supplementary 
Figure S5). These results suggest that Pkd1 inactivation in kidney 
epithelial cells directly contributes to the in vivo signature of lipid 
metabolism dysfunction. </p>

<p>3.6. Lipid Metabolism is A Disease Modifier </p>

<p>If lipid metabolism plays a role in cystogenesis, we hypothesized 
that the lipid content of diets could alter disease progression. Since 
breast milk fatty acid composition can be manipulated through diet 
(Oosting et al., 2015), we tested the hypothesis by feeding nursing 
dams two chows that differ mainly in their lipid composition (NIH31 
and NIH37; supplementary files 1 and 2) to nursing moms and young 
pups in two mouse models of Pkd1 inactivation: a tamoxifen-inducible 
line (ER-Cre), induced at 7 days of age (P7) and harvested at P21; and 
a Ksp-cre line, expressing the cre-recombinase under the control of 
Ksp and resulting in epithelial deletion of Pkd1 in mid-gestation, </p>

<p>harvested at P14. The change in diet had no significant effect on body 
weight (p = 0.52 and p = 0.2, respectively; Fig. 4) and on both diets 
kidneys were quite cystic. However, in both lines, decreasing the lipid 
content of the diet by what seemed a trivial amount (from 7.47% fatty 
acids to 5.62%) resulted in a small but statistically significant improve-
ment (ER-Cre model: p = 0.04, Cohen's d = 0.78; n = 19(NIH31) and 
14(NIH37); 95% confidence interval reduction in KBW between 1.4% 
and 46.4%); Ksp-Cre model: p = 0.03, Cohen's d = 0.62; n = 26 
(NIH31) and 26 (NIH37); 95% confidence interval reduction in KBW 
between 1.1% and 19.1%; Fig. 4). </p>

<p>4. Discussion </p>

<p>While the idea that altered metabolism may be a major driver of 
cellular growth is widely appreciated in the cancer field, this was largely 
not considered for PKD until our previous network analysis of early 
onset PKD (Menezes et al., 2012) and the description of a Warburg 
effect in Pkd1 
ko/ko mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Rowe et al., 2013). </p>

<p>The current study significantly extends the prior work but also has 
important differences. Using a systems-based approach to examine 
the effects of acquired loss of Pkd1 in mouse kidney as they transition 
from normal to cystic state, we again found that differentially expressed 
genes showed enrichment for metabolic pathways and that these were 
associated with global metabolic differences in cystic kidneys. Impor-
tantly, we also found that sex was an important determinant of disease 
severity, that the transcriptional profiles of normal male and female 
kidneys differed almost as much as those of normal and cystic kidneys, 
and that differentially expressed gene modules were greatly enriched 
for genes involved in lipid metabolism. 
Though metabolic (and lipid) pathways were not the only enriched 
pathways in our study, they were the common thread linking several 
observations: a) female mice had less severe PKD; b) the top scoring 
pathways different between normal male and female kidneys were 
related to lipid metabolism; c) lipid metabolism pathways were also 
different between mutant and controls. In addition, other groups have 
reported slower progression of many kidney diseases in females 
(reviewed in (Silbiger and Neugarten, 2008)) and that impaired fatty 
acid oxidation is a component of chronic kidney disease (Kang et al., 
2015; Silbiger and Neugarten, 2008). We tested a role for lipid metabo-
lism in PKD in two ways: a) fatty acid oxidation assay using cell lines (to 
differentiate between changes secondary to renal damage versus intrin-
sic defects in Pkd1 
ko/ko cells); and b) the effects of dietary lipid on PKD </p>

<p>progression in Pkd1 
ko/ko mice. We found that renal epithelial cells lack-</p>

<p>ing Pkd1 have cell autonomous defects in fatty acid oxidation. Notably, 
consistent with Warner et al., but not Rowe et al., (Warner et al., 
2015; Rowe et al., 2013), we did not find elevated lactic acid levels in 
cystic kidneys nor enhanced glycolytic activity in renal epithelial cells 
lacking Pkd1. 
To what extent these metabolic defects contribute to PKD is still an 
open question: Fig. 3 clearly shows lower FAO activity in each of the mu-
tant lines compared to the wild type control from which each was de-
rived, but it also shows that the range of FAO values in mutants is 
similar to that of control cells. Therefore, the absolute effects resulting </p>

<p>Fig. 1. Sex is a major determinant of disease progression and gene expression profiles in a mouse PKD model. a) Kidney to body weight ratios (KBW) plotted over time starting 50 days after 
Pkd1 inactivation and showing more rapid and severe kidney disease in males (curve fitted for each sex/genotype group using generalized linear model with gamma distribution; the line 
for control female overlaps and is obscured by the control male line). b) Multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot representing similarity in gene expression patterns between samples and 
showing that sex and cystic stage are responsible for most of the difference. Each dot corresponds to one kidney (size: correlates with KBW). c) Representative kidney histology of 
mutant and control male and female mice showing cystic mutant male and less affected littermate mutant female. Boxes delimit group comparisons using all animals in the dataset 
and corresponding number of differentially expressed genes. d) Heatmap plot showing patterns of gene expression between male and female control kidneys. Each column is a sample 
and each row is a gene. The colored vertical bar on the left groups genes with very similar (correlated) expression patterns into modules. These clusters can be further grouped into 2 
sets of correlated genes that we labeled "Meta-module 1" and "Meta-module 2" (demarcated on the right margin of the plot). The dendogram on the top shows that the expression 
pattern of these genes can separate male and female kidneys. e and f) Differential expression in cystic females mirror those in males. e) Cumulative distribution of p values comparing 
mutant vs. control at different age intervals in males and females. The curves show that the number of differentially expressed genes in females is similar to those in younger males, 
consistent with a delayed, but similar, disease process in females. f) Bar plot showing that the number of differentially expressed genes between mutant and controls correlates with 
age (disease severity), and is smaller in females, likely reflecting the delayed phenotype. In the more severe stage, most differentially expressed genes (orange) were differentially 
expressed in both males and females. Each bar corresponds to genes differentially expressed only in females (red), only in males (blue), or in both (orange). </p>

<p>from Pkd1 loss may be quite modest. Nonetheless, our observation that 
a very modest change in the lipid composition of diet could significantly 
affect the progression of disease, in the context of the current findings, 
suggests that metabolic pathways are an integral part of PKD and 
supports the notion that the metabolic abnormalities observed in the 
cystic kidneys result from an intrinsic defect in lipid metabolism. 
There are a number of other lines of evidence that suggest that 
altered cellular metabolism might be a primary factor in PKD: 1) drugs 
known to have significant metabolic effects, like rapamycin and metfor-
min, slowed cyst growth in Pkd1 ADPKD mouse models (Shillingford 
et al., 2010; Takiar et al., 2011); 2) ciliary signaling -believed to be a 
major player in PKD -plays an important role in regulating cellular 
metabolism via a number of different mechanisms, including direct con-
trol of mitochondrial function (Boehlke et al., 2010; Oh et al., 2015; Hoff 
et al., 2013); 3) mutations of several genes that encode proteins with 
primary metabolic functions have been reported to cause renal cysts, </p>

<p>including fumarate hydratase (OMIM 150800) (Lehtonen et al., 2006; 
Adam et al., 2011) and, in glutaric acidemia type II (OMIM 231680), 
genes encoding proteins involved in electron transfer in the mitochon-
drial respiratory chain (ETFA, ETFB, ETFDH (Böhm et al., 1982; Wilson 
et al., 1989); 4) finally, a recent report describing that Fat (ft), an 
atypical cadherin, long-studied as a prototypical member of the planar 
cell polarity pathway (PCP) (Sing et al., 2014), undergoes proteolytic 
cleavage to release a soluble 68 kDa fragment that is imported into 
mitochondria where it binds directly to and stabilizes the activity of 
NADH dehydrogenase ubiquionone flavoprotein 2, a core component 
of complex I activity. As defects in planar cell polarity (PCP) can 
cause PKD, usually believed as secondary to disrupted mitotic spindle 
orientation or convergent-extension processes during development 
(Fischer et al., 2006; Karner et al., 2009), this finding is particularly 
interesting and may provide another link between cilia, metabolism 
and PKD. </p>

<p>occurs on multiple levels, as previous studies have identified inflamma-
tory pathways and cAMP signaling as both important progression 
factors in PKD (Torres et al., 2004, 2012; Torres and Harris, 2014; 
Menon et al., 2011; Klawitter et al., 2013; Karihaloo et al., 2011) 
and subject to sex effects (Grimble, 2002; Barton and Prossnitz, 2015; 
Davis et al., 2014; Auger, 2003; Abrahám and Herbison, 2005; 
Liu et al., 2011; Juul et al., 2014). Our data suggest that sexual 
differences in fatty acid metabolism may be another important 
disease-modulating factor. 
Our findings also may have broader implications for other forms of 
renal injury as male sex is associated with accelerated progression in 
many kidney diseases (Silbiger and Neugarten, 2008). Gene expression 
analysis of samples of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) was 
reported enriched for genes involved in inflammatory and metabolic 
pathways, particularly fatty acid oxidation (FAO), a pattern somewhat 
similar to the findings presented here (Kang et al., 2015). Similarly, 
transgenic mice overexpressing in proximal tubules PPARalpha, a 
known regulator of FAO, seemed to have reduced morphological 
damage after ischemic injury (Li et al., 2013). These effects are postulat-
ed to involve modulation of fibrotic responses. If and how such cascades 
relate to the metabolomics of PKD, if microcystic changes commonly 
found in CKD contribute to its metabolic component and what is unique 
or shared in the metabolic trigger or response of different kidney 
diseases remain to be studied. 
These data have a number of other important implications. Our diet 
studies provide confirmation that in an orthologous PKD model diet can 
modify disease and suggest the possibility that diet could be a modifi-
able risk factor in humans. It should be noted that our study is unusual 
in that the diet manipulation was trivial: while many high-fat diet ma-
nipulations aim for fat as the primary source of energy, NIH-31 (~5.6% 
fat) and NIH-37 (~7.5%) can be used interchangeably in mouse colonies, 
the latter being sometimes preferred for lactating moms. That we can 
detect a difference should be a reminder that research conducted 
asynchronously or in different animal facilities within the same institu-
tion could not be directly comparable if diet is not standardized. It also 
suggests that clinical studies might be improved by stratification 
according to diet and/or metabolic parameters. </p>

<p>This study also suggests two important new lines for future investi-
gation: how loss of Pkd1 results in a cell autonomous fatty acid oxidation 
defect and, more broadly, how altered cellular metabolism leads to 
dysregulation of tubular diameter and planar cell polarity. While meta-
bolic reprogramming may contribute to the increased proliferation seen 
in some forms of PKD, hyperproliferation is not a universal feature of all 
forms of cystic disease. One intriguing speculation is that the abnormal-
ities we have identified are associated with altered lipid biosynthetic 
pathways, the latter playing important roles in regulating cellular mem-
brane properties and hence cellular structure and function (Holthuis 
and Menon, 2014). 
In conclusion, we have shown a significant sexual difference in 
PKD progression in this mouse model, identified altered lipid 
metabolism as a possible underlying cause and confirmed that 
PKD has an intrinsic dysfunction in fatty acid oxidation. We there-
fore suggest that PKD could be a disease of altered cellular metabo-
lism, a model that nicely links a number of otherwise disconnected 
findings in a common process. These results have important impli-
cations for how one should model and study the disease and 
opens new avenues to understand pathogenesis and ameliorate 
disease.

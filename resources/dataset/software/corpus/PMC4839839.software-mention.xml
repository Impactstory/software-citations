<p>Abstract: The often cited need to achieve !95% (nearly perfect) </p>

<p>adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for successful virologic 
outcomes in HIV may present a barrier to initiation of therapy in the 
early stages of HIV. 
This meta-analysis synthesized 43 studies (27,905 participants) 
performed across &gt;26 countries, to determine the relationship between 
cut-off point for optimal adherence to ART and virologic outcomes. 
Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effect model to 
calculate pooled odds ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. 
The mean rate of patients reporting optimal adherence was 63.4%. 
Compared with suboptimal adherence, optimal adherence was associated 
with a lower risk of virologic failure (0.34; 95% CI: 0.26-0.44). There 
were no significant differences in the pooled odds ratios among different 
optimal adherence thresholds (!98-100%, !95%, !80-90%). Study 
design (randomized controlled trial vs observational study) (regression 
coefficient 0.74, 95% CI: 0.04-1.43, P &lt; 0.05) and study region (devel-
oping vs developed countries; regression coefficient 0.56, 95% CI: 0.01-
1.12, P &lt; 0.05) remained as independent predictors of between-study 
heterogeneity, with more patients with optimal adherence from devel-
oping countries or randomized controlled trials experiencing virologic 
failure. 
The threshold for optimal adherence to achieve better virologic 
outcomes appears to be wider than the commonly used cut-off point 
(!95% adherence). The cut-off point for optimal adherence could be 
redefined to a slightly lower level to encourage the prescribing ART at an 
early stage of HIV infection. </p>

<p>H </p>

<p>IV/AIDS has been transformed into a manageable chronic 
disease with the advent of combination antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) initiated as the standard of care. 
1 Three classes 
of HIV medications have been widely used in combination-
nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 
nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and 
protease inhibitors (PIs). 
1 Despite the availability of effective 
treatment options, suboptimal adherence to treatment can result 
in insufficient viral suppression and promote the emergence of 
drug-resistant viral strains, resulting in regimen failure, pro-
gression to AIDS, and death. 
2-4 Paterson et al suggested that at 
least 95% adherence to unboosted PIs was required for virologic 
suppression. 
5 This 95% adherence cut-off point, based on what 
is now obsolete therapy, has been widely used as the level of 
optimal adherence needed to be met by patients taking newer 
agents and their combinations. The concern that patients may 
not achieve a near-perfect adherence presents a barrier for 
initiation of therapy in the early stages of HIV. </p>

<p>6   This meta-analysis integrated finding from observational 
studies on ART adherence with 2 objectives: (a) to critically 
evaluate the association between optimal adherence to ART and 
virologic outcomes, and (b) to use meta-regression to determine 
methodological, regimen, and population factors that could mod-
erate the relationship between adherence and virologic outcomes. </p>

<p>METHODS </p>

<p>We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement in conduct-
ing this meta-analysis. 
7 Studies eligible for inclusion were 
randomized controlled trials, retrospective analyses of data 
from trials, and cohort studies measuring the relationship 
between medication adherence to ART and virologic failure. </p>

<p>Search Strategy </p>

<p>WB carried out systematic literature searches of the 
electronic databases MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane Clinical 
Trials, and EMBASE from their inception date to 17 April 2015. 
This search used combinations of the following key words: 
medication adherence, patient compliance, antiretroviral 
therapy, antiretroviral agent, antiretroviral treatment, protease 
inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, vir-
ologic failure, and viral load. The reference lists of all articles 
included in this meta-analysis were also searched. Review 
articles, editorials, commentaries, government reports, and 
guidelines were excluded from this review. Titles and abstracts </p>

<p>SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS </p>

<p>Medicine Volume 95, Number 15, April 2016 </p>

<p>www.md-journal.com | 1 </p>

<p>of potentially relevant articles were screened independently by 
WB and YM. Full articles of potentially appropriate citations 
were screened for inclusion in this review if they fulfilled the 
following criteria: original research, participants aged 16 years 
or older, having a clear definition of medication adherence 
measurement and clear cut-off points for optimal and subopti-
mal adherence, and virologic failure stratified by optimal and 
suboptimal medication adherence groups. Ethical approval was 
not required as this study was based on published data and had 
no direct access to patient information. </p>

<p>Data Collection and Outcome Measures </p>

<p>WB extracted data using standardized forms, with record-
ing of authors, year of publication, country of study, study type, 
regimen, method of adherence measurement, cut-off points for 
good adherence, and virologic failure. The data were verified by 
a second reviewer (YM). Disagreements between reviewers 
were resolved through discussion until a consensus was 
reached. Study authors' grouping of patients into optimal and 
suboptimal adherence using the most objective measure was 
used. When a study reported &gt;1 adherence measurement, 
the most reliable adherence measurement data was used, with 
reliability defined in following order: medication event 
monitoring system (MEMS) &gt; pill count &gt; pharmacy refill &gt; 
self-reported adherence in the past week &gt; self-reported adher-
ence in the past month. When the number of virologic failures 
within each adherence group was not reported, we calculated 
virologic failure from the information provided in the paper or 
contacted the corresponding author. Studies were excluded 
when it was not possible to obtain virologic failure data in 
each adherence group. The United Nations Human Develop-
ment Index (HDI) ranking was used to categories studies into 
low and high human development groups. </p>

<p>8   Statistical Analyses </p>

<p>The data were analyzed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">Review Manager (RevMan</rs>) 
version <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">5.3</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Cochrane Collaboration</rs>, The Nordic Cochrane 
Centre, Copenhagen, <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-date">2014</rs>) and <rs id="software-1" type="software">Comprehensive Meta-Analysis</rs> 
(CAM) version <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">3.3.070</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">Biostat</rs>, Englewood, NJ). Each class of 
antiretroviral was considered in a separate analysis of the 
association between adherence and virologic failure in random-
ized clinical trials. Results are presented based on 9 categories, 
including study region, antiretroviral regimen, treatment experi-
ence, virologic failure cut-off points, adherence cut-off points, 
adherence measurement, study design, observation period, and 
year of publication. Adherence pooled odds ratios and 95% 
confidence intervals were calculated using a random effect 
model (DerSimonian and Lard) 
9 that accommodated the ran-
dom variation within studies and between-studies. </p>

<p>10   Heterogeneity between-studies were examined using the Q 
and I 
2 statistics. 
9,11 The odds ratio was plotted against the 
inverse of standard error to identify the risk of publication bias 
by visually assessing the symmetry of funnel plots. Statistical 
significance was confirmed using Egger's test, 
12 with a P value 
&lt;0.05 considered suggestive of publication bias. A meta-
regression was performed to examine major moderators of 
the between-studies heterogeneity. Results with P values 
&lt;0.1 from univariate analyses were included in the multivariate 
meta-regression model. </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>Overall, 1796 studies were identified, of which 1449 were 
excluded after review of the title and abstract (Figure 1). The </p>

<p>full text of the remaining 347 citations was screened, and 43 
studies with 27,905 participants met the inclusion criteria. The 
included studies had wide a variation in sample sizes 
(range Â¼ 34-3607, mean Â¼ 649, SD Â¼ 805) and a slight 
majority of participants were men (57%). Twenty-five studies 
were prospective studies 
5,13-36 that reported virologic failure 
according to adherence group. The remaining studies were 
randomized controlled trials (11)  37-47 and retrospective studies 
(7). 
48-54 Characteristics of the included studies are shown in 
Table 1. 
With respect to location, 14 studies were conducted in sub-
Saharan Africa; 9 in the US; 6 in Canada; 5 in Europe; 5 in Asia; 
1 in Australia; and 3 studies in several countries. Twenty-two 
(49%) studies included only treatment-naive patients and the 
remaining 21 studies included both treatment-naive and/or 
treatment-experienced patients. All studies reported cut-off 
points for optimal adherence and virologic failure. Thirty 
studies (70%) defined optimal adherence as !95%, with the 
remainder using 100%, 98%, 90%, 85%, and 80% as the cut-off 
points. Optimal adherence rates varied greatly across studies, 
partially due to the use of these different cut-off points and also 
different methods of measurement to assess adherence. The 
mean rate of achieving optimal adherence in adults was 63.4% 
(standard deviation [SD] Â¼ 23.7, range 5% to 97%, n Â¼ 43). </p>

<p>Meta-analysis and Meta-regression </p>

<p>Of a total 27,905 participants, 22,740 participants had a 
viral load and adherence measurement; 7056 (31%) had vir-
ologic failure. Overall, 3464 of 15,067 participants with optimal 
adherence to ART (23%), and 3592 of 7673 participants with 
suboptimal adherence (47%) participants had virologic failure 
(Figure 2). The pooled odds ratio for virologic failure for 
optimal adherence compared to suboptimal adherence was 
0.34 (95% CI: 0.26-0.44). A high degree of heterogeneity 
was found: Q statistic P &lt; 0.001 and I 
2 Â¼ 90%. The funnel plot 
did not show asymmetry (Figure 3), and the result of Egger's 
test was not statistically significant (P Â¼ 0.68). We conducted 
subgroup analyses to recalculate the pooled odds ratio accord-
ing to study design, HDI rank, regimen, treatment experience, 
viral load cut-off points, adherence measurement, and adher-
ence cut-off points (Table 2). 
The results of univariate meta-regression analyses for 
different moderators are shown in Table 3. Based on virologic 
failure cut-off points, studies were classified into three sets 
including: 100 copies/mL, 11 studies (N Â¼ 5646); between 
100 copies/mL and 400 copies/mL, 17 studies (N Â¼ 9351); 
and between 500 copies/mL and 1000 copies/mL, 14 studies 
(N Â¼ 7383). The pooled odds ratio for virologic failure for 
optimal adherence compared to suboptimal adherence for the 
studies with the lowest virologic failure cut-off was higher 
(0.55; 95% CI: 0.41-0.74, I 
2 Â¼ 56%) than for the studies with an 
intermediate virologic failure cut-off (0.37; 95% CI: 0.26-0.54, 
I 
2 Â¼ 88%). The group using a virologic failure cut-off 
&gt;500 copies/mL had the lowest pooled odds ratio for virologic 
failure (0.25; 95% CI: 0.16-0.41, I 
2 Â¼ 92%). Studies with the 
lowest virologic failure cut-off reported a significantly different 
pooled odds ratio compared with studies with a virologic failure 
cut-off &gt; 500 copies/mL (regression coefficient Ã0.75; 95% 
CI: Ã1.39 to Ã0.12, P Â¼ 0.02). 
According to participants' treatment experience, studies 
were grouped into 3 sets: treatment-naive patients only, 22 
studies (N Â¼ 17,010); treatment-experienced patients only, 12 
studies (N Â¼ 4009), and both treatment-naive and experienced 
patients, 9 studies (N Â¼ 1721). The pooled odds ratio for optimal </p>

<p>adherence compared to suboptimal adherence for virologic 
failure for treatment-experienced patients was the highest 
(Table 2); however, no statistically significant difference in 
pooled odds ratio was found between the 3 groups. 
The relationship between adherence and virologic out-
comes varied with type of adherence measurement. The pooled 
odds ratio for the self-report adherence measure (0.45; 95% CI: 
0.37-0.55, I 
2 Â¼ 31%) was higher than the pooled odds ratio for 
the pharmacy refill (0.29; 95% CI: 0.20-0.41, I 
2 Â¼ 94%). The 
group using MEMS adherence measure had the lowest pooled 
odd ratio (0.15; 95% CI: 0.06-0.37, I 
2 Â¼ 35%) for optimal 
adherence compared to suboptimal adherence for virologic 
failure. There was a trend toward significant difference across 
the odds of virologic failure between self-report and MEMS 
(regression coefficient Ã1.00; 95% CI: Ã2.05, 0.06, P Â¼ 0.06), 
but not between self-report and pharmacy refill (regression 
coefficient Ã0.22; 95% CI: Ã0.78, 0.34, P Â¼ 0.45). 
The pooled odds ratios were also estimated by grouping 
studies using cut-off points for optimal adherence studies with a 
cut-off point between 98% and 100%, 7 studies (N Â¼ 3940); 
studies with a cut-off point of !95%, 30 studies (N Â¼ 17,779); 
and studies with a cut-off point of 80% to 90%, 6 studies 
(N Â¼ 1021). The pooled odds ratios for virologic failure for 
optimal adherence compared to suboptimal adherence for each </p>

<p>cut-off point were similar, with no statistically significant 
differences. 
The pooled odds ratio for optimal adherence compared to 
suboptimal adherence for observational studies was signifi-
cantly greater than randomized controlled studies (regression 
coefficient, 0.66; 95% CI: 0.10, 1.21, P Â¼ 0.02). Studies were 
aggregated into three subgroups according to HIV-medication 
regimens: NNRTI-based, boosted PI-based, and unboosted PI-
based. The pooled odds ratio for virologic failure for optimal 
adherence compared to suboptimal adherence for patients tak-
ing NNRTI-containing regimens was the highest, but the differ-
ences in pooled odds ratios between the regimens were not 
statistically significant. 
Studies were subgrouped into 2 groups based on the HDI of 
the country in which the study was performed: very high HDI, 
21 studies (N Â¼ 10,466); low HDI, 19 studies (N Â¼ 9945). The 
pooled odds ratio for optimal adherence compared to subopti-
mal adherence for countries with low HDI (0.50; 95% CI: 0.35-
0.72) was significantly higher than countries with very high 
HDI (0.23; 95% CI: 0.15-0.33). 
A multivariate meta-regression model was built-in to 
examine the specific moderators of the between-study hetero-
geneity, including the following: study region, threshold used to 
define virologic failure, adherence measurement, study design, </p>

<p>adults taking ART. This study revealed that adherence levels as 
low as 80% to 90% may be adequate for viral suppression in 
patients taking newer antiretroviral drugs. Our data also showed 
that pooled odds ratios for virologic failure for optimal adher-
ence compared to suboptimal adherence were similar between 
NNRTI-based and boosted PI-based regimens. The effective-
ness of newer antiretroviral agents at the lower level of adher-
ence may encourage the prescribing of ART at an early stage of 
HIV infection. 
The findings indicated that the mean proportion of patients 
who were reported to demonstrate optimal adherence world-
wide was 63.4%, which is similar to a meta-analysis of 84 
studies that reported 62% of patients take !90% of their 
prescribed ART. 
55 The results of this study demonstrate that 
adherence is robustly associated with virologic outcomes across 
the various types of adherence measure, ART regimen, study 
population, and reporting. The odds of virologic failure were 
almost 3 times higher for participants with suboptimal adher-
ence compared with those with optimal adherence. This 
confirms that achieving long-term optimal adherence is indeed 
Achilles' heel of successful virologic outcomes.

<p>clinicians to exert concerted efforts to maintain continuing 
optimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy is indisputable. 
Classifying patients according to various optimal adher-
ence thresholds (!98-100%, !95%, and 80-90%) did not 
result in statistically significant differences in the odds of 
virologic failure. This finding is consistent with a meta-analysis 
of 37 studies in children that reported no significant group 
differences in virologic outcomes between different thresholds 
of good adherence. 
57 This suggests that patients who achieved 
''perfect'' (100%) or ''near perfect'' (!95%) adherence did not 
necessarily have better virologic outcomes than patients who 
had achieved ''good enough'' (!80-90%) adherence. This 
finding has clinical importance and is in line with previous 
studies 
58,59 that indicated that although the need to maintain 
high levels of adherence to achieve long-term virologic sup-
pression is clear, the level of adherence behavior capable of 
sustaining viral suppression is broader than previously thought. 
Considerable variation in the relationship between adher-
ence and virologic outcomes was found based on the type of 
adherence measurement used in the studies we reviewed. For 
studies using self-reported adherence, the odds of virologic 
failure in participants with optimal adherence was about half 
that of participants with suboptimal adherence. The odds of 
virologic failure for optimal adherence were about one-third and 
one-seventh that of the participants with suboptimal adherence </p>

<p>using pharmacy refill and MEMS, respectively. Our meta-
analysis undermines the validity of using self-reported adher-
ence to distinguish virologic outcomes. A high proportion of 
patients with optimal self-reported adherence experienced vir-
ologic failure. Self-reported adherence is potentially con-
founded by social desirability and recall bias, which leads 
patients to overestimate their actual adherence; 
60 this method 
is inferior to MEMS in its ability to explain virologic outcomes. 
Despite the findings 
17,61 of previous studies suggesting the 
need for different levels of optimal adherence between anti-
retroviral regimens for achieving similar virologic outcomes, 
classifying patients based on regimen did not result in statisti-
cally significant differences in the odds of virologic outcomes in 
this meta-analysis. 
The pooled odds ratio for optimal adherence compared to 
suboptimal adherence for virologic failure for studies with 
virologic failure cut-offs &lt; 100 copies/mL were significantly 
higher than studies with virologic failure cut-offs between 
500 copies/mL and 1000 copies/mL. The rate of virologic fail-
ure detected in patients with good adherence increased when 
studies defined a virologic failure at a low level of HIV-1 
ribonucleic acid (RNA). The relationship between adherence 
and viral load improved when the level of detection of HIV-1 
RNA increased. The tighter the definition of virologic failure 
the more likely it is to unmask suboptimal adherence. </p>

<p>The odds of virologic failure for optimal adherence were 
about half and one-third that of the patients with suboptimal 
adherence in countries with a low HDI and high HDI, respect-
ively. More patients with optimal adherence experienced vir-
ologic failure in countries with low HDI than in countries with 
high HDI. This review indicates that patients with equal or 
better levels of optimal adherence in developing countries 
compared to developed countries 
62 does not necessarily trans-
late into better virologic outcomes. This might be associated 
with the increase in pretreatment antiretroviral drug resistance </p>

<p>63   and unavailability of baseline HIV drug resistance testing 
before initiation of ART 
64 in resource-limited settings that have 
a potential to contribute to the increasing rates of virologic 
failure in optimally adherent patients. We support moves 
toward the use viral load monitoring at the point of care in 
resource-limited settings 
65 to improve treatment outcomes. 
Study design (observational study vs randomized con-
trolled trials) was an independent predictor of between-study 
heterogeneity. More patients with optimal adherence experi-
enced virologic failure in randomized controlled trials than in 
observational studies. Differences in estimated magnitude of 
treatment effect are very common between randomized con-
trolled trials and observational studies. 
66 This difference in 
virologic outcomes between study designs might be related 
with selection bias in observational studies 
67 and higher quality 
and rigor of randomized controlled trials. 
This meta-analysis shares the limitations intrinsic to meta-
analysis in general and with studies of adherence in particular. 
We only included studies published in English, so we may have 
missed studies that were relevant to our research question 
during the literature search. When the included studies were 
stratified and analyzed based on regimen, virologic failure cut-
off, adherence cut-off and type of adherence measurement, </p>

<p>heterogeneity between-studies remained high for most of the 
subgroups. Because of this high degree of heterogeneity, which 
was not entirely described either by subgroup analysis or by 
meta-regression, our pooled results need to be viewed with 
caution. </p>

<p>CONCLUSION </p>

<p>Irrespective of the cut-off point for optimal adherence, our 
findings support the tenet that optimal adherence to ART is 
associated with positive clinical outcomes. The threshold for 
optimal adherence to achieve better virologic outcomes appears 
to be wider than the commonly used cut-off point (!95% 
adherence). Though patients taking ART should be instructed 
to attain !95% adherence, apprehensions of slightly lower 
adherence should not deter prescribing ART regimens at an 
early stage of HIV infection. </p>

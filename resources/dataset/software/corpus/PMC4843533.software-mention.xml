<p>Background--Blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) mediate therapeutic neovascularization in experimental models, but 
outgrowth characteristics and functionality of BOECs from patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICMP) are unknown. We 
compared outgrowth efficiency and in vitro and in vivo functionality of BOECs derived from ICMP with BOECs from age-matched 
(ACON) and healthy young (CON) controls. </p>

<p>Methods and Results--We isolated 3.6AE0.6 BOEC colonies/100910 
6 mononuclear cells (MNCs) from 60-mL blood samples of 
ICMP patients (n=45; age: 66AE1 years; LVEF: 31AE2%) versus 3.5AE0.9 colonies/100910 
6 MNCs in ACON (n=32; age: 
60AE1 years) and 2.6AE0.4 colonies/100910 
6 MNCs in CON (n=55; age: 34AE1 years), P=0.29. Endothelial lineage (VEGFR2

CD31

+ /CD133 </p>

<p>À </p>

<p>) marker expression was comparable in ICMP and CON. Growth kinetics were 
similar between groups (P=0.38) and not affected by left ventricular systolic dysfunction, maladaptive remodeling, or presence of 
cardiovascular risk factors in ICMP patients. In vitro neovascularization potential, assessed by network remodeling on Matrigel and 
three-dimensional spheroid sprouting, did not differ in ICMP from (A)CON. Secretome analysis showed a marked proangiogenic 
profile, with highest release of angiopoietin-2 (1.4AE0.3910 
5 pg/10 
6 ICMP-BOECs) and placental growth factor 
(5.8AE1.5910 
3 pg/10 
6 ICMP BOECs), independent of age or ischemic disease. Senescence-associated b-galactosidase staining 
showed comparable senescence in BOECs from ICMP (5.8AE2.1%; n=17), ACON (3.9AE1.1%; n=7), and CON (9.0AE2.8%; n=13), 
P=0.19. High-resolution microcomputed tomography analysis in the ischemic hindlimb of nude mice confirmed increased 
arteriogenesis in the thigh region after intramuscular injections of BOECs from ICMP (P=0.025; n=8) and CON (P=0.048; n=5) over 
vehicle control (n=8), both to a similar extent (P=0.831). </p>

<p>Conclusions--BOECs can be successfully culture-expanded from patients with ICMP. In contrast to impaired functionality of ICMP-
derived bone marrow MNCs, BOECs retain a robust proangiogenic profile, both in vitro and in vivo, with therapeutic potential for 
targeting ischemic disease. ( J Am Heart Assoc. 2016;5:e002288 doi: 10.1161/JAHA.115.002288) </p>

<p>4   Refractory angina is an increasingly prevalent clinical 
syndrome with an estimated incidence between 5% and 10% 
of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization.

<p>with ischemic heart disease, refractory to optimal medical 
treatment and percutaneous or surgical revascularization,

<p>to induce neovascularization not only by incorporation into 
functional vessels, but also through paracrine modulation. </p>

<p>7,8   One of the major concerns when envisioning autologous 
(progenitor/stem) cell therapy in cardiovascular medicine, is 
the presumed dysfunctional progenitor cell phenotype in older 
and diseased patients burdened with risk factors, as evi-

<p>11   Because no data are currently available on BOEC out-
growth and functionality in patients with the greatest unmet 
clinical need, we compared outgrowth efficiency and in vitro 
and in vivo functional characteristics of BOECs from patients 
with severe, but stable, ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICMP) and 
BOECs from both healthy age-matched (ACON) and young 
(CON) control subjects. </p>

<p>Methods </p>

<p>Study Design </p>

<p>BOECs were isolated from peripheral blood of patients with 
stable ischemic cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection 
fraction [LVEF] ≤45%; 18-80 years) (ICMP: n=45; Table 1) 
in follow-up at the outpatient heart failure clinic of the 
Department of Cardiovascular Diseases at University Hospi-
tals (Leuven, Belgium). The study protocol was approved by 
the Medical Ethics Committee (S51940), and informed 
consent was obtained from all patients. The control group 
consisted of healthy individuals (18-80 years; Table 1) with 
no evidence/history of coronary artery disease, divided in an 
age-matched (ACON: n=32) and young (CON: n=55) control 
populations. </p>

<p>BOEC Isolation and Expansion </p>

<p>BOECs were isolated and expanded as previously described, 
with minor modifications. 
4,8 In short, the mononuclear </p>

<p>fraction from 40-to 60-mL venous blood samples was </p>

<p>isolated using Ficoll Paque Plus (GE Healthcare, Little 
Chalfont, UK) density centrifugation. Cells were resuspended 
in EBM 2 supplemented with a bullet kit (Lonza, Basel, 
Switzerland), excluding the provided gentamicin and amfo-
tericin singlequots. In addition, the medium was supple-
mented with an extra 13% of FBS, MEM-NEAA (Gibco, Grand 
Island, NY), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), and 1:550 
b-Mercaptoethanol (Gibco). Cells were cultured on collagen 
type I precoated dishes (Cellcoat; Greiner Bio-One GmbH, 
Kremsm€ unster, Austria) in a 21% O 2 , 5% CO 2 incubator. </p>

<p>ICMP BOECs Retain Neovascularization Potential 
Dauwe et al </p>

<p>ORIGINAL RESEARCH </p>

<p>Individual BOEC colonies were picked at days 21 to 28 and 
pooled for further polyclonal expansion up to passage 7 or 
growth arrest. Phenotyping and functional evaluation was 
performed at passage 3 to 5 (Figure 1). Mycoplasma 
contamination was excluded, using the MycoAlert Myco-
plasma detection kit (Lonza), following the manufacturer's 
instructions. </p>

<p>Confirmation Endothelial Phenotype </p>

<p>Cells were stained with Ulex europeus agglutinin (UEA)-lectin 
(Sigma-Aldrich). Dil-AcLDL uptake (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) 
and cell surface markers were quantified using flow cytometry 
(BD FACS Canto II; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). CD309 
(vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2; VEGFR-2), 
CD146 (melanoma cell adhesion molecule), and CD31 
(platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1) were selected 
as endothelial markers, CD34 and CD133 as progenitor 
markers, and CD45 as a panleukocyte exclusion marker. 
Antibodies and isotype controls were from Miltenyi Biotec 
(Cambridge, MA). Gene expression was studied using real-
time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR; StepOnePlus; Applied 
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and TaqMan Gene Expression 
Assays (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), focusing on angio-
genic growth factors and endothelial markers (Table 2, top). 
Results are expressed as a 2 
ÀDCT -value, relative to HPRT as </p>

<p>the housekeeping gene. In addition, the angiogenic secretome 
was studied in 24-hour conditioned medium (EBM 2 /2%FBS) 
by ELISA (PLGF, angiopoietin-2 [ANG-2], fibroblast growth 
factor [FGF] 2, platelet-derived growth factor-BB [PDGF-BB], 
VEGF 165 , insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], and HGF, 
hepatocyte growth factor [HGF]; Quantikine; all from R&amp;D 
Systems, Minneapolis, MN; Table 2, bottom). </p>

<p>Proliferation Potential </p>

<p>Cell numbers were calculated at every passage in order to 
derive expansion curves and calculate population doubling 
times throughout the entire expansion process. In addition to 
growth kinetics, senescence was quantified by senescence-
associated b-galactosidase staining (Senescence Detection 
Kit; BioVision, Inc., Milpitas, CA). The number of blue cells was 
manually counted and reported as a percentage of the entire 
cell population. </p>

<p>In Vitro Oxidative Stress </p>

<p>Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was quantified 
using CM-H 2 DCFDA (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as a 
fluorescent ROS indicator (Ex/Em: 492-495/517-527). Cells 
were loaded with a final dye concentration of 10 lmol/L for 
30 minutes at 37°C. Intensity of the fluorescence was </p>

<p>ICMP BOECs Retain Neovascularization Potential 
Dauwe et al </p>

<p>ORIGINAL RESEARCH </p>

<p>measured using a fluorescence plate reader at baseline, 10 and 
45 minutes after exposure to 500 lmol/L H 2 O 2 . Additionally, 
cells were exposed to 1000 lmol/L of H 2 O 2 for 24 hours, after 
which cell viability was quantified by flow cytometry using 7-
aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) as a viability marker. </p>

<p>In Vitro Neovascularization Potential </p>

<p>In a matrigel "network remodeling" (Tube Formation) assay 
(BD Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix, 354234; BD 
Biosciences), a total of 75 000 BOECs were seeded per 24-
well, coated with 300 lL of Matrigel. Phase contrast mosaic 
images were acquired of the complete well after 6 hours of 
incubation. The cellular network was manually delineated in 
order to semiautomatically quantify total network length and 
the number of intersections using ImageJ software (National 
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Additionally, sprouting 
angiogenesis was studied using a three-dimensional (3D) 
spheroid sprouting assay in collagen gel, as previously 
described with minor modifications. 
16 In short, BOEC </p>

<p>spheroids containing 1000 cells were generated by suspen-
sion culture in EBM 2 culture medium containing 0.25% (w/v) 
carboxymethylcellulose, seeded in nonadherent round-bot-
tomed 96-well plates. Under these conditions, all suspended 
cells contribute to the formation of a single BOEC spheroid </p>

<p>per well. These spheroids were harvested within 24 hours and 
embedded in collagen gels (Rat Tail Collagen Type I; Corning, 
Corning, NY), as previously described. 
16 The length of the 3 </p>

<p>longest capillary-like sprouts that had grown out of each 
spheroid was measured after 24 hours. A total of 20AE2 
spheroids per sample were analyzed. </p>

<p>In Vivo Neovascularization Potential </p>

<p>All animal procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee 
on Animal Use of KU Leuven (Leuven, Belgium) and conform 
to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 
published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Female 8-
to 10-week-old athymic NMRI nude mice (Janvier Labs, Le 
Genest-Saint-Isle, France) were anesthetized with an intraperi-
toneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine 
(15 mg/kg). The common, superficial, and deep femoral 
artery of the right leg were ligated and transsected in 
between. Laser Doppler measurements (PIM-II; Lisca Devel-
opment AB, Link€ oping, Sweden) were performed under 2% 
isoflurane gas anesthesia and temperature-controlled condi-
tions (37°C) 5 days after hindlimb ischemia surgery to assess 
degree of flow reduction. Only animals with ≥55% flow 
reduction in the ischemic versus nonligated control limb were 
included in the study. </p>

<p>ORIGINAL RESEARCH </p>

<p>Intramuscular injections of 250 000 BOECs from 
patients (ICMP) or young controls (CON) versus vehicle 
control (PBS) were performed in the ischemic hindlimb, 
5 days after the ligation procedure. Cells were resuspended 
in 100 lL of PBS and subsequently injected into the thigh 
region (5910 lL) and gastrocnemius muscle (5910 lL) 
using a 1-mL 29G syringe. Intraperitoneal anti-asialo-GM1 
injections (Wako Chemicals, Inc., Dallas, TX) were per-
formed once a week to suppress residual natural killer cell 
activity. 
Mice were euthanized 21 days after femoral artery ligation. 
At sacrifice, mice were sedated with an intraperitoneal </p>

<p>injection of Nembutal 70 mg/kg. A midline sternotomy was 
performed to expose the heart, followed by insertion of a 
winged 25G needle (Mycroflex; Vygon, Ecouen, France) into 
the LV apex and removal of the right auriculum. Vessels were 
perfused by the LV cavity with 20 mL of saline, containing 
100 IU/mL of unfractionated heparin, in order to remove the 
blood and prevent clotting. Tissue was subsequently fixed by a 
15-mL perfusion with neutral buffered formalin 10%, followed 
by 20 mL of saline to wash out the fixative. A final perfusion 
with a preheated mixture of 30% barium sulphate (Micro-
paque; Guerbet, France) and 2% gelatin was performed in 
order to visualize the vessel tree on post-mortem angio </p>

overnight to solidify the gelatin and fix the contrast agent in 
the vessels. 
The hind limbs were scanned with a high-resolution 
microCT (50 kV, 200 lA, 10 W; SkyScan-1172; SkyScan, 
Virginia Beach, VA) at a pixel size of 8 lm, providing highly 
detailed, quantitative 3D structural data of the perfused 
"vessel tree" of the complete limb. The individual two-

<p>Patient Characteristics </p>

<p>BOEC isolations were performed in 45 patients (ICMP, 
66AE1 years) and 32 healthy age-matched (ACON, 
60AE1 years) and 55 healthy young (CON, 34AE1 years) 
controls (Table 1). Global systolic LV function was impaired 
(LVEF 31AE2%) without concomitant adverse LV remodeling 
(left ventricular end diastolic diameter [LVEDD], 56AE1 mm) in 
the majority of patients. Adverse LV remodeling, defined as an 
LVEDD ≥60 mm on a transthoracic acquired echocardiogra-
phy parasternal long axis view, was present in 12 of 45 
(26.7%) patients. Four patients were excluded from the study 
because blood was taken less than 1 month after device 
implantation. </p>

<p>BOEC Outgrowth Efficiency </p>

<p>Starting from 40 to 60 mL of whole blood, a mean of 3.6AE0.6 
BOEC colonies/100910 
6 MNCs could be obtained from </p>

<p>patients versus 3.5AE0.9 from age-matched controls and 
2.6AE0.4 from healthy young controls (P=0.29; Figure 2A). 
Colonies could be obtained in 84% of ICMP, 72% of ACON and 
82% of CON. The number of BOEC colonies obtained in our 
ICMP population increased with age (r=0.42; P&lt;0.01; Fig-
ure 2B), but was not affected by severity of the disease 
process, assessed by LVEF (r=À0.12; Figure 2C) or adverse 
LV remodeling (Figure 2D). BOEC outgrowth was independent 
of the extent of coronary artery disease, number of cardio-
vascular risk factors, and presence of diabetes mellitus 
(Figure 2E through 2G). </p>

The panleukocyte marker, CD45, was absent in all groups. RT-

<p>BOEC In Vitro Neovascularization Potential </p>

<p>We subsequently focused on functional neovascularization 
potential of the obtained cell populations. In vitro vasculo-
genic potential, explored using the Matrigel network remod-
eling assay (Figure 6A), did not show differences in the 
number of network intersections between cells from ICMP 
and (A)CON (P=0.32; Figure 6B). Total network length did not 
differ between cells from ICMP and (A)CON. An increase in 
network length was, however, noted in aged versus young 
controls. Severity of the disease process, assessed by LVEF, 
did not impair in vitro network formation potential. On the 
contrary, LVEF inversely correlated with total network length 
(r=À0.57; P=0.01; n=16) and the number of intersections </p>

<p>(r=À0.53; P=0.03; n=16; Figure 6C). Body mass index (BMI) 
was positively correlated with in vitro vasculogenic potential 
(r=0.58; P=0.02; n=16). No other major clinical, biochemical, 
or hematological predictors could be identified. Additionally, 
in vitro angiogenesis potential, explored using a 3D spheroid 
sprouting assay in collagen gel, did not show differences in 
sprouting angiogenesis between BOECs from ICMP and CON 
(P=0.70; Figure 7). 
RTqPCR and ELISA documented a marked proangiogenic 
profile with high expression of angiogenic growth factors 
(ANG-2, PLGF, PDGF-BB, FGF-2, and VEGF) both in BOECs 
from patients and controls (Table 2). ANG-2 and PLGF were 
the most abundant angiogenic growth factors in 24-hour 
conditioned medium, with similar amounts secreted by BOECs 
from ICMP and healthy subjects ([A]CON) (P=0.66 and 0.13 
for ANG-2 and PLGF, respectively). </p>

<p>BOEC In Vivo Neovascularization Potential </p>

<p>Initial acute retention and biodistribution studies, using 
Cherry-labeled BOECs, documented multiple clusters and 
singlets of transplanted cells in the femoral and tibiofibular 
region 24 hours after intramuscular cell delivery (average of 
312 BOECs/4.5 mm 
2 ), mainly localized in perimuscular </p>

<p>connective tissue (Figure 8). No detectable distribution was 
observed in lungs, spleen, liver, kidneys, and heart. 
Doppler flow index at inclusion (5 days after hindlimb 
ischemia surgery) was similar in all groups (vehicle control: 
35.9AE1.5; CON-BOECs: 35.5AE1.8; ICMP-BOECs: 35.9AE2.0; 
P=0.98). High-resolution angio microCT of the upper leg 
confirmed enhanced BOEC-mediated arteriogenesis in com-
parison to vehicle control, 21 days after surgery (Figure 9). 
Although total vessel length and the number of vessel 
branch points tended to be increased after BOEC delivery 
from both CON and ICMP (Figure 9B), therapeutic effects 
were confined to smaller arterioles with a diameter ranging 
from 32 to 64 lm (Figure 9D), corresponding to collateral 
arteries, as documented by Scholz and Schaper.   17,18   Importantly, increased arteriogenesis was observed after 
transplantation of BOECs from healthy young controls 
(P=0.048) and ICMP patients (P=0.025) over vehicle 
control, both to a similar extent (P=0.831). Clinically, 
BOECs were able to prevent additional amputations after 
cell delivery (5 days after hindlimb ischemia surgery). A 
total of 3 of 14 animals suffered from additional amputa-
tions after injections of vehicle control versus none in the 
BOEC-injected groups. 
Immunostaining for human CD31 and in situ hybridiza-
tion for primate specific ALU-repeat sequences could detect 
incorporation of rare human BOECs into murine vessels in 
the ischemic hindlimb 21 days after surgery (Figure 10).

further enhance expansion success. 
In contrast to various other cell types, we observed 
preserved neovascularization potential of BOECs derived from 
an older patient population with severe ICMP. Ingram et al. 
reported that BOECs contain a complete hierarchy of low-and 
high-proliferation potential cells, analogous to the hematopoi-
etic cell system. 
27 Moreover, long-term culture conditions </p>

<p>may erase the functional "fingerprint" of various microenvi-
ronmental factors, present in the donor milieu. Cell types with 
a previously documented dysfunctional phenotype in an older

exposed to short-term in vitro cell culture (eg, circulating 
angiogenic cells and colony-forming-unit EPCs) or no in vitro 
environment at all (eg, CD133

donor microenvironmental influences and positive selection 
based on proliferation potential were only minimally or not 
present. Specific reports on BOEC functionality and prolifer-

not uniform. Functional impairment has been reported, related

<p>and proliferation potential in a patient population with severe, 
but stable, ischemic heart failure. We noted, however, mild 
positive correlations between Matrigel network formation 
potential and both degree of systolic LV dysfunction and BMI 
within our patient cohort. No differences were noted in 
response to oxidative stress, studied by ROS induction and 
cell viability. 
We studied in vivo cell-mediated neovascularization poten-
tial using high-resolution angio microCT because of its ability 
to quantitatively assess the complete "vessel tree" in 3D. 
Histology is mainly restricted to evaluating vascular density in 
a limited 2D area of view, whereas laser Doppler flowmetry is 
only reporting superficial blood flow (200-300 lm penetra-
tion depth), classically in the foot region. 
36 Collateral vascular </p>

<p>remodeling (arteriogenesis) has been postulated as the most 
important mechanism to compensate for bulk perfusion loss. 
Efficient collateral formation is a critical determinant of tissue 
vulnerability and preservation during ischemia. Occlusion of 
the femoral artery in a hindlimb ischemia model results in 
development of collateral vessels in the upper leg, relatively 
close to the site of occlusion. In contrast, ischemia and 
angiogenesis occur in the lower leg and foot. 
37 We conse-</p>

<p>quently focused on the thigh region as the readout for 
collateral vascular remodeling, and observed that cells from 
both patients and controls support the arteriogenesis process 
to a similar extent, especially at the level of arterioles (32-
64 lm in diameter). Extensive (ultra)structural histological 
analysis by Scholz and Schaper in murine hindlimbs previously 
identified collateral arteries in the 40-to 70-lm diameter 
range. 
17,18 We documented a significant BOEC-mediated </p>

<p>increase in vascular length within this specific size range. 
A trend toward a BOEC-mediated increase of vessel length 
and number of branch points of the complete vessel tree in 
the thigh region of the ligated leg was noted. These results 
did, however, not reach statistical significance, given that the 
therapeutic effects were confined to one specific size range 
(arterioles 32-64 lm in diameter). Arteriogenesis relies on a 
complex interplay of many growth factors, of which ANG-2, 
PLGF, FGF, and PDGF-BB were all demonstrated to be 
secreted by BOECs. </p>

<p>37-40   Acute retention studies documented BOECs, mainly 
clustered within the perimuscular compartment 24 hours 
after intramuscular injection. At 21 days, we noted disap-
pearance of the BOEC clusters in the perimuscular com-
partment and appearance of isolated BOECs in the vascular 
compartment. We observed only limited incorporation/ 
engraftment of BOECs into functional blood vessels after 
intramuscular delivery of 250 000 cells per mouse, suggest-
ing a concomitant paracrine contribution of the transplanted 
cell population to their neovascularization potential. These 
findings indicate migration toward and engraftment within 
the vascular compartment to perform their biological effects, </p>

<p>"sustained" release of a proangiogenic/-arteriogenic growth 
factor "cocktail" with or without incorporation into functional 
vessels. ANG-2 and PLGF were found to be the most 
abundantly secreted angiogenic growth factors, independent 
of underlying ischemic disease. Both ANG-2 and PLGF play 
an important role in the complex cytokine cocktail, mediat-
ing the overall neovascularization process in ischemic 
disease. </p>

<p>37-47   In conclusion, we report that BOECs can be isolated and 
culture-expanded from patients with severe, but stable, ICMP 
and offer an easily accessible, clonally expandable cell source 
with profound neovascularization potential. In contrast to 
impaired functionality of other progenitor cell types derived 
from patients with advanced cardiovascular disease, BOECs 
retain a robust proangiogenic profile in vitro and in vivo and 
hold promise for autologous cell therapy in severe or 
refractory ischemic heart disease. </p>

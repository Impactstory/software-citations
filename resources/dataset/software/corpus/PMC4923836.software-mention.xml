<p>Introduction: Nurses' professional competence is a crucial factor in clinical practice. 
Systematic evaluation of nurses' competence and its related factors are essential for 
enhancing the quality of nursing care. This study aimed to assess the nurses' 
competence level and its possible relationship with their personality and emotional 
intelligence. 
Methods: Using a cross-sectional survey design, three instruments including Nurse 
Competence Scale, short form of Schutte Self Report Emotional Intelligence Test, and 
the short 10-item version of Big Five Factor Inventory, were administered 
simultaneously to a randomized stratified sample of 220 nurses working in hospitals 
affiliated to Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. Data analysis was performed 
using SPSS 11.5. 
Results: Majority of nurses rated themselves as "good" and "very good", with the 
highest scores in "managing situations" and "work role" dimensions of nurse 
competence. A relatively similar pattern of scores was seen in competence dimensions, 
personality and emotional intelligence, among male and female nurses. Emotional 
intelligence and personality scores showed a significant relationship with nurses' 
competence, explaining almost 20% of variations in nurse competence scores. 
Conclusion: Iranian nurses evaluated their overall professional competence at similar 
level of the nurses in other countries. Knowledge about the nurses' competence level 
and its related factors, including personality and emotional intelligence, may help nurse 
managers in enhancing nurses' professional competence through appropriate task 
assignments and conducting in-service educational programs, thus improving the 
health status of patients. </p>

<p>A total of 204 questionnaires (response rate: 
92.7%) were returned. Of them, 173 
questionnaires without missing responses in 
the NCS and its sub-scales were used in the 
analyses. Table 1 and Table 2 represent nurses' 
descriptive variables. </p>

<p>Nurses' self-assessed competence level </p>

<p>The total score of clinical competence of 
nurses' ranged from 35 to 100 (n=173). The 
mean of nurses' competence scores was 75.16 
(SD=13.15; SE=1.00). Majority of nurses rated 
themselves as "good" and "very good". As 
seen in Figure 1, score variations in 
dimensions of nursing skills represent a 
similar pattern among male and female nurses. </p>

<p>Nurses' professional competence, personality and EI </p>

<p>Journal of Caring Sciences, June 2016; 5 (2), 121-132 |125 </p>

<p>Highest scores belong to "managing 
situation" and "work role" both in male and 
female nurses, while lowest scores in male 
nurses pertain to "ensuring quality" and 
"teaching-coaching" skills, and in female 
nurses to "ensuring quality" and "therapeutic 
interventions". The overall frequencies of the 
skills "used occasionally" and "used often" by 
nurses, were 74.0% for helping roles, 70.3% for 
teaching-coaching, 71.0% 
for diagnostic 
functions, 88.7% for managing situations, 
68.4% for therapeutic interventions, 60.2% for 
ensuring quality, and 74.9% for work role. 
Mean reported score for frequency of using the 
skills, ranged from 2.99 for "ensuring quality", 
to 3.46 for "managing situations" categories. 
A linear positive correlations were observed 
between the frequencies with which the skills 
used by nurses and their competence scores in 
all categories. The Pearson correlation 
coefficient between these variables showed a 
moderate to strong values of 0.714 (helping 
role), 
0.696 
(teaching-coaching), 
0.671 
(diagnostic functions), 0.678 (managing 
situations), 0.654 (therapeutic interventions), 
0.659 (ensuring quality), and 0.646 (work role), 
all were statistically significance at 95% 
confidence level (P&lt;0.001). </p>

<p>Background factors in relation to the nurse 
competence levels </p>

<p>No statistically significant correlation was 
found between age and the NCS overall scores 
as well as its sub-scores (r=0.140, P=0.073). 
NCS overall scores were not significantly 
different between male and female (t=1.223, 
P=0.223), as well as single and married nurses 
(t=0.840, P=0.076). Also, variables including 
years of working experience, residence place 
(city, countryside), type of university (public, 
private), high school and university GPAs, 
showed no significant association with NCS 
scores and its sub-scores (P&lt;0.05). </p>

<p>Personality and Emotional Intelligence </p>

<p>Figures 2 and 3 show a similar pattern in 
scores of personality and EI dimensions 
between male and female nurses. The overall 
mean for total personality scores was 35.82 </p>

<p>(4.167). Maximum and minimum scores 
belonged 
to 
the 
dimensions 
of 
conscientiousness 
and 
neuroticism, 
respectively. Female nurses rated their 
personality slightly higher than their male 
counterparts in all dimensions, except 
"openness to experiences", though this 
difference was not statistically significant, 
neither in total scores (P=0.471), nor in sub-
scores (P=0.527). 
The overall mean for total EI scores was 
98.18 (9.277). The highest and lowest scores 
belonged to the dimensions of "appraisal of 
emotions", 
and 
"intrapersonal 
and 
interpersonal 
utilization 
of 
emotions", 
respectively both in male and female nurses. 
Again, female nurses retained their slight 
dominance in terms of their EI scores as 
compared to male nurses; but here, this 
dominancy were statistically significant in the 
total EI score (P=0.032) and sub-score of 
"intrapersonal and interpersonal utilization of 
emotions" (P=0.010), according to Mann-
Whitney U test. 
Using 
Spearman's 
rank 
correlation 
coefficient, NCP overall scores showed modest 
to moderate positive correlations with both the 
total personality scores (r=0.297, P&lt;0.001), and 
total EI scores (r=0.488, P&lt;0.001). Accordingly, 
multiple linear regression analyses were 
adopted to examine the association of EI and 
personality traits as independent variables, 
with NCS overall scores, as dependent 
variables. Using the Enter method, we 
included the total personality and EI scores in 
the model, and set the probability of F value to 
0.05 and 0.1 for entry and removal of variables 
in the model, respectively. Table 3 shows a 
regression model in which the nurses' total 
personality and EI scores can significantly 
predict their NCS overall scores (P&lt;0.001). The 
model produced an R 2 value of 0.215 
(SE=11.700), explaining almost 20% of total 
variance in NCS overall scores. According to 
standardized Beta values, EI showed a 
stronger correlation with nurse competence 
and had more weight in predicting NCS 
overall scores, as compared to personality 
scores. Standardized Beta coefficients indicate </p>

<p>that an increase of one standard deviation in 
personality scores, holding the EI scores 
constant, results in an increase of NCS total 
scores by almost 21% of its standard deviation. 
Similarly, an increment of EI score by one </p>

scores constant, results in an increase of NCS 
total scores by almost 40% of its standard 
deviation (Table 3). </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>In this study, the majority of nurses 
assessed their overall nursing competencies 
as good and very good. This is in line with 
the result of other studies conducted in Iran 
and other countries. 8,9,23 This may indicate 
that Iranian nurses are as competent as 
nurses in other countries, despite their 
different educational and cultural context. 
Undoubtedly, more detailed, cross-cultural 
studies seem to be required to determine 
the roots of this similarity. 
The male and female nurses similarly 
rated themselves in "managing situation" 
and "work role" with the highest scores; 
while they did it in the "ensuring quality" 
and "teaching-coaching" dimensions, with 
the lowest scores. Exactly similar pattern 
was reported in Istomnia et al., study in 
which the Lithuanian surgical nurses 
assessed their professional competence; 
however, the results were not reported 
separately for male and female nurses. 9 
A positive correlation existed between the 
frequencies of using the nurse skills and the 
competence level of those skills. This is 
consistent with previous studies. 9,27,33,39 As 
expected, the higher the frequency of using 
a skill, the higher the competence level in 
that skill. 26 Poor overall mean score in 
ensuring quality dimension signifies the 
vigorous need of managers' more attention 
to this dimension. 
Our results showed that the nurses' 
personality and EI are significantly 
correlated with their competence level. The 
association of nurses' performance and their 
personality traits, 19,20,40 as well as their 
EI 11,17,41,42 has been discussed in the 
literature. Pitt et al., demonstrated that </p>

<p>personal qualities affect academic and 
clinical performance of preregistration 
nurse students as well as their ability to 
complete a pre-registration program in 
three years. They reported that better 
academic performance was correlated with 
lower 
aloofness, 
higher 
self-control 
(conscientiousness), and higher resilience 
(emotional stability). Also they found that 
students with higher confidence had been 
more competent in their final clinical 
assessment. 40 
In the study of Chang et al., nurses who 
had positive evaluation and expectation 
towards themselves and others, expressed 
higher job satisfaction. They advocated that 
training workshops can enhance nurses' 
self-care awareness, helping them to 
become more proactive in their work. 12 
In another study, Whitworth reported a 
relationship between female nurses' 
personality type and their preferred conflict 
management styles. She suggested that 
nurse managers should consider the 
relationship 
between 
personality 
characteristics and methods of dealing with 
conflicts, as a component of nurse 
competence, for facilitating constructive 
changes in organizational culture. 22 In line 
with this, Shimizutani et al., showed an 
association between nurses' personality 
characteristics and their coping styles, as 
well as personal, work-relates, and client-
related burnout. 21 
Above findings suggest that as the 
desired changes in personality is not easy, 
the nurse managers are expected to appoint 
their nurse staff to those tasks that well-
match with their personality attributes. This 
may help to prevent conflicts and nurse </p>

<p>burnout, and ultimately improves patient 
outcomes. 5 
O'Boyle et al., in their meta-analysis 
addressed the emotional intelligence as an 
important predictor of job performance and 
work-related outcomes. 41 Also, the impact 
of emotional intelligence on nursing team 
performance and cohesiveness has been 
studied. It is believed that emotional 
regulation may enhance patient outcomes, 
thus training professionals to this ability 
could be productive. 17 Moreover, the 
relationships 
of 
EI 
and 
nursing 
performance, stress, coping, and well-being 
among nurses have been supported in other 
studies. 11,16 Bulmer-Smith et al., concluded 
that emotionally intelligent leaders may 
positively affect the employee retention, 
nursing 
care 
quality, 
and 
patient 
outcomes. 10 
Moreover, Kooker et al., highlighted the 
importance of EI competencies in both 
practice and educational settings. 42 
The relationship of personality and EI has 
been addressed in the literature. 14,16,28 
Whether the personality is associated with 
EI or not, the relationship of performance 
with both personality and EI has been 
established separately in the literature. 
Likewise, the relationship of these two 
factors with nurse competence was 
demonstrated in the present study. We 
believe that, nurses' competence acts as a 
mediator between the variables of nurses' 
personality and EI in one side, and the 
variable of nurses' performance on the 
other side. Obviously, more detailed 
structural modeling studies are required to 
confirm such relationships. 
The randomized cluster sampling in this 
study may increase the representativeness 
of the sample, thus increasing the 
generalizability of the findings. Also, we 
achieved a high response rate by providing 
the participants with face to face 
explanation of the study details and 
instruction to complete the questionnaires, 
ensuring them about the anonymity. Also, 
simultaneous inclusion of personality and </p>

<p>EI to assess their relationship with nurse 
competence may be considered as strength 
of present study; though no causality 
inferences can be made because of cross-
sectional design adoption. 
The sample size of this study was not 
large. Also, to achieve measures of nurse 
competence levels, we merely used a self-
report approach. Adoption of multi-method 
approach to nurse competence evaluation 
may increase the validity of results. </p>

<p>Conclusion </p>

<p>Overall, Iranian clinical nurses evaluated 
their professional competencies as "good" 
and "very good". The nurses' competence 
level was associated with their personality 
traits and EI. Nursing leaders, who can 
address the personality types and emotional 
side of their staff, patients, and families, 
may develop highly energized and 
synergized teams, necessary for survival 
during this ever-changing landscape of 
healthcare. 
More 
longitudinal 
and 
interventional studies are needed to give 
clearer picture of factors shaping and 
influencing the nurses' competence. Also, 
systematic and regular evaluation of nurses' 
competence level is of paramount. </p>

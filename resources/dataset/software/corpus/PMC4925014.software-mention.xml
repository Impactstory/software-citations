<p>Previous studies have revealed that a population of innate memory CD8 
+ T cells is generated in response to IL-4, first appearing 
in the thymus and bearing high expression levels of Eomesodermin (Eomes) but not T-bet. However, the antigen specificity and 
functional properties of these cells is poorly defined. In this study, we show that IL-4 regulates not only the frequency and 
function of innate memory CD8 
+ T cells, but also regulates Eomes expression levels and functional reactivity of naive CD8 
+ T 
cells. Lack of IL-4 responsiveness attenuates the capacity of CD8 
+ T cells to mount a robust response to lymphocytic chorio-
meningitis virus infection, with both quantitative and qualitative effects on effector and memory antigen-specific CD8 
+ T cells. 
Unexpectedly, we found that, although numerically rare, memory phenotype CD8 
+ T cells in IL-4Rα-deficient mice exhibited 
enhanced reactivity after in vitro and in vivo stimulation. Importantly, our data revealed that these effects of IL-4 exposure 
occur before, not during, infection. Together, these data show that IL-4 influences the entire peripheral CD8 
+ T cell pool, in-
fluencing expression of T-box transcription factors, functional reactivity, and the capacity to respond to infection. These 
findings indicate that IL-4, a canonical Th2 cell cytokine, can sometimes promote rather than impair Th1 cell-type immune 
responses. </p>

<p>effector program, and in established memory CD8 
+ T cells, 
T-bet and Eomes cooperate to promote IL-2Rβ (CD122) 
expression, which is required for memory cell homeostasis 
(Kaech and Cui, 2012). However, the two transcription fac-
tors also have nonredundant roles and different expression 
profiles in short-lived effector cells (SLECs) versus memory 
precursor effector cells (MPECs): High expression levels of 
T-bet promotes terminal effector cell differentiation, whereas 
Eomes expression levels peak in memory CD8 
+ T cells, and 
Eomes is required for efficient production of central memory 
CD8 
+ T cells (Joshi et al., 2007; Banerjee et al., 2010; Rao et  al., 2010), as well as innate memory CD8 
+ T cells (Weinreich  et al., 2009; Sosinowski et al., 2013). 
Although the role of IL-4 in inducing innate memory 
CD8 
+ T cells in the thymus has been well studied, little is 
known about how the response to IL-4 shapes homeostasis 
and function of the peripheral CD8 
+ T cell pool. This is im-
portant to assess because some studies have shown that mem-
ory phenotype CD8 
+ T cells generated through homeostatic 
mechanisms act by inhibiting rather than enhancing the 
T cell immune response (Rifa'i et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2007;  Dai et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2010, 2011; Sakuraba et al., 2013). 
Here, we show that responsiveness to IL-4 during CD8 </p>

<p>T cell development and homeostasis leads to diverse changes 
in functional response and gene expression not only of mem-
ory phenotype CD8 
+ T cells, but also of naive CD8

Although IL-4Rα-deficient memory phenotype CD8 </p>

<p>T cells exhibited low Eomes expression, our data unex-
pectedly revealed that these cells had enhanced capacity to 
produce inflammatory cytokines in vitro and expand to lym-
phocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in vivo. 
These data suggest that a lack of IL-4 sensitivity chiefly com-
promises the numbers rather than intrinsic function of mem-
ory-like cells. Through adoptive transfer studies, we could also 
show that sensitivity to IL-4 encounter during the response 
to LCMV was not necessary to support an effective CD8 </p>

<p>+ </p>

<p>T cell response, suggesting that the impact of IL-4 is pri-
marily through its effects on CD8 
+ T cell development and 
homeostasis. Collectively, our results indicate that IL-4 has 
diverse effects on the phenotype and function of the whole 
peripheral CD8 
+ T cell population and that IL-4 responsive-
ness enhances the CD8 
+ T cell response to pathogens. </p>

<p>RES ULTS 
IL-4 responsiveness dictates the frequency of innate 
memory CD8 
+ T cells in secondary lymphoid tissues 
Innate (bystander) memory CD8 
+ T cells are generated in 
the thymus of certain mouse strains in a process depen-
dent on IL-4 produced by NK T cells and IL-4 sensitivity 
by CD8 
+ T cells themselves (Weinreich et al., 2010; Lee et  al., 2013b). However, it is less clear whether and how IL-4 
reactivity affects the peripheral pool of memory phenotype 
CD8 
+ T cells. We initially compared the CD8 
+ T cell pools 
from spleen and lymph nodes of naive WT and IL-4Rα KO 
BALB/cByJ mice. Although the total numbers of lympho-</p>

<p>cytes were similar (Fig. 1 A), IL-4Rα KO mice exhibited 
a decreased frequency of CD8 
+ T cells (Fig. 1 B), leading 
to reduced numbers of CD8 
+ T cells (Fig. 1 C). Preliminary 
studies indicated total lymphocyte numbers in IL-4Rα KO 
mice were normalized by an increased frequency of B cells 
(not depicted). Using CD44 and CXCR3 surface expres-
sion as markers (Ventre et al., 2012), we differentiated the 
CD8 
+ T cell pool into three populations: naive phenotype 
(CD44 
lo CXR3 </p>

<p>lo </p>

<p>), memory phenotype (CD44 
hi CXCR3 
hi ), 
and an intermediate phenotype (CD44  hi CXCR3 </p>

<p>lo </p>

<p>) popula-
tion (gating shown in Fig. 1 D). IL-4Rα KO mice had de-
creased frequencies of memory phenotype CD8 
+ T cells in 
the periphery, with reciprocal increased frequencies of naive 
phenotype cells, compared with WT (Fig. 1 E). These differ-
ences resulted in a substantial decrease in memory phenotype 
CD8 
+ T cell numbers (and slightly fewer intermediate cells), 
whereas the number of naive CD8 
+ T cells increased in IL-
4Rα KO mice (Fig. 1 F). To determine whether the impact of 
IL-4 responsiveness was cell extrinsic or intrinsic, we gener-
ated mixed BM chimeras, in which congenically distinct IL-
4Rα KO and WT BM cells were coinjected to reconstitute 
lethally irradiated hosts. As in the intact mice, the frequency of 
memory phenotype CD8 
+ T cells was significantly reduced in 
the IL-4Rα KO donor population, whereas naive phenotype 
CD8 
+ T cells frequencies were increased (Fig. 1 G), demon-
strating that these effects reflect a cell-intrinsic role for IL-
4Rα on CD8 
+ T cells (as was found for thymic IL-4-induced 
memory phenotype CD8 
+ T cells [Weinreich et al., 2009]). 
It was possible that IL-4Rα deficiency caused a reduc-
tion in conventional rather than innate memory phenotype 
CD8 
+ T cells. We and others have shown that a significant 
fraction of C57BL/6 CD8 
+ T cells specific for varied for-
eign antigens exhibit a memory phenotype despite no pre-
vious exposure to those antigens; this population of innate 
memory cells has also been called virtual memory CD8 </p>

population was only modestly reduced in IL-4-or IL-4Rα-
deficient C57BL/6 mice (Akue et al., 2012; Sosinowski et al.,  2013), but it was unclear whether the much larger popula-
tion of IL-4-dependent memory-like cells in BALB/c mice 
included virtual memory cells. To address this, we performed 
tetramer enrichment assays to isolate antigen-specific CD8 </p>

riolysin O 91-99 (LLO 91-99 ) epitope were modestly reduced 
in IL-4Rα-deficient BALB/c mice (Fig. 2, A and C). On 
resolution of phenotypic subsets, it became apparent that 
the numbers of foreign antigen-specific naive CD8 
+ T cells 
were not significantly changed in unimmunized WT and IL-
4Rα-deficient mice but that numbers of both memory and 
intermediate phenotype cells were reduced in the IL-4Rα 
KO animals (Fig. 2, B and D). Similar findings were observed 
when L

(not depicted). These results indicate that our findings for the 
bulk CD8 
+ T cell pool also apply to precursors specific for 
unencountered antigens. Together, these results indicate that 
IL-4Rα expression by CD8

eration and/or maintenance of innate memory phenotype 
CD8

<p>. In contrast, IL-4Rα 
deficiency resulted in reduced Eomes and elevated T-bet ex-
pression by memory phenotype cells. Unexpectedly, analysis 
of IL-4Rα KO mice also revealed reduced Eomes expression 
(and moderately increased T-bet expression) in the naive and 
intermediate phenotype CD8 
+ T cell populations (Fig. 3, B 
and C). This conclusion was supported when Eomes 
hi and Eo-
mes 
lo peaks were analyzed separately; Eomes expression levels 
were higher in WT versus IL-4Rα KO CD8 
+ T cells within 
these populations (not depicted). It was possible that IL-4Rα-
dependent Eomes expression by CD8 
+ T cell subsets was not 
caused by IL-4 sensitivity by CD8 
+ T cells themselves. Hence, 
we again examined mixed BM chimeras (as in Fig. 1) and 
found that Eomes expression was highly dependent on IL-
4Rα expression by CD8 
+ T cells (Fig. 3 D), indicating a CD8 </p>

<p>
IL-4Rα-deficient cells from the mixed BM chimeras 
(Fig. 3 E), suggesting this effect was not cell autonomous. 
Together, these data show that IL-4 sensitivity is re-
quired for maximal Eomes expression not only by memory 
phenotype BALB/c CD8 
+ T cells, but also in naive (and 
intermediate) phenotype CD8 
+ T cells. These findings in-
dicate that IL-4 influences gene expression in the entire pe-
ripheral CD8 
+ T cell pool. </p>

<p>IL-4 responsiveness influences cytokine and effector 
molecule production by stimulated CD8 
+ T cells 
CD8 
+ T cells with high expression of Eomes and low expres-
sion of T-bet have been associated with not only differenti-
ation of functionally potent memory CD8 
+ T cells in acute 
infection models (Banerjee et al., 2010), but also with terminal 
differentiation of exhausted CD8 
+ T cells in chronic infection 
studies (Paley et al., 2012). Hence, the functional impact of 
altered Eomes and T-bet ratios observed in WT and IL-4Rα-
deficient BALB/c CD8 
+ T cells is difficult to predict. </p>

<p>To address this, we first measured cytokine produc-
tion after T cell activation in vitro. We and others previously 
showed that IL-4-induced memory phenotype cells in the 
thymus were capable of rapid IFN-γ production upon TCR 
stimulation; however, these studies entailed comparison with 
the response of IL-4 KO or IL-4Rα KO CD4 
− CD8 
+ thy-
mocytes, which are dominated by naive phenotype cells 
(Weinreich et al., 2010; Lai et al., 2011). A direct comparison 
between the responses of naive and memory CD8 
+ subsets in 
WT and IL-4Rα-deficient BALB/c mice has not been care-
fully investigated. First, we stimulated bulk CD8 
+ T cells from 
peripheral lymphoid tissues of WT and IL-4Rα KO mice 
with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 and assayed production of the 
inflammatory cytokines TNF and IFN-γ. Unexpectedly, de-
spite the increased frequency of memory phenotype CD8 </p>

<p>+ </p>

<p>T cells in WT animals, similar frequencies of WT and IL-
4Rα KO CD8 
+ T cells produced IFN-γ at 6-and 24-h time 
points, and a greater proportion of IL-4Rα KO CD8 
+ T cells 
expressed TNF at 6 h (a time point chosen because this cyto-
kine is produced early after stimulation; Fig. 4 A; Badovinac et  al., 2000). These findings prompted us to study the responses 
of WT and IL-4Rα KO CD8 
+ T cell subpopulations. Hence, 
we next sorted the three CD8 
+ T cell subsets (see Fig. 1) and 
tested their individual responses to T cell activation (Fig. 4, 
B-D). Similar to the bulk populations (Fig. 4 A), IL-4Rα 
KO CD8 
+ T cells from all three subsets showed an increased 
frequency of TNF-producing cells compared with their WT 
counterparts (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, at 24 h of stimulation, 
we observed increased percentages of IFN-γ-producing cells 
from all three subsets of CD8 
+ T cells derived from IL-4Rα 
KO animals relative to WT (Fig. 4 D). This result was not 
caused by altered kinetics of IFN-γ expression by WT ver-
sus IL-4Rα-deficient populations because a significantly 
higher fraction of IL-4Rα KO CD8 
+ memory phenotype 
T cells produced IFN-γ even at 6 h of stimulation (a time 
point at which very few CXCR3 </p>

<p>lo </p>

<p>/CD44 
hi/lo populations 
expressed IFN-γ; Fig. 4 C). 
These data suggest that the reduced frequency of mem-
ory phenotype and Eomes 
hi CD8 
+ T cell populations in 
IL-4Rα-deficient mice may be partially offset by increased 
functional reactivity, at least in terms of inflammatory cyto-
kine production. Hence, we next sought to investigate the 
consequences of these differences by tracking the in vivo re-
sponse of WT and IL-4Rα KO CD8 
+ T cells to infection. </p>

<p>IL-4 sensitivity regulates the CD8

to acute viral infection 
The role for IL-4 in regulating the CD8 
+ T cell response to 
infection is unclear. IL-4 reactivity was proposed to be import-
ant for optimal effector (Carvalho et al., 2002) and memory 
(Morrot et al., 2005) CD8 
+ T cell responses to a mouse model 
of malaria. However, IL-4 signaling may inhibit polyfunctional 
responses to viral infection (Wijesundara et al., 2013) and may 
reduce activation of memory CD8 
+ T cells after in vitro re-
stimulation (Ventre et al., 2012). To investigate whether IL-4 </p>

<p>sensitivity impacted the CD8

we infected WT and IL-4Rα KO mice with an acute viral 
pathogen, LCMV Armstrong, and tracked the response of L

+ T cells, as well as the bulk CD8

pool. In part, we chose to follow the response to L

because, in our hands, the total numbers of antigen-specific 
precursors were not substantially different between WT and 
IL-4Rα KO mice, whereas the numbers of nonnaive pheno-
type antigen-specific cells was significantly reduced (Fig. 2). 
WT and IL-4Rα KO mice had similar frequencies of NP 118-</p>

(Fig. 5 A). However, we found significantly decreased numbers 
of total CD8

after LCMV infection (Fig. 5 B), and accordingly, the abso-
lute numbers of antigen-specific CD8 
+ T cells were reduced 
in IL-4Rα animals (Fig. 5 C). It is worth noting that the fold 
difference in bulk and antigen-specific CD8

<p>T cells. Because we found that IL-4 sensitivity influenced 
Eomes and T-bet expression in unimmunized CD8

populations (Fig. 3), we next measured intracellular expression 
of these factors in the antigen-specific CD8 
+ T cells at the ef-
fector stage of the response to LCMV. We observed decreased 
frequency and numbers of Eomes-expressing CD8 
+ T cells in 
IL-4Rα KO mice (Fig. 5 D and not depicted). Although an in-
creased frequency of IL-4Rα KO antigen-specific CD8 
+ T cells 
was either T-bet single positive or expressed low levels of both 
transcription factors (Fig. 5 D), this did not translate into in-
creased absolute numbers of these populations (not depicted).

<p>
versus IL-4Rα KO animals reflected alterations in the re-
sponse of other IL-4-sensitive cells and/or aspects of viral 
control (e.g., viral clearance kinetics). To control for this, 
we conducted similar experiments in mixed BM chime-
ras, in which we could determine the intrinsic impact of 
IL-4Rα deficiency among the CD8 
+ T cell population. 
Those studies revealed that the differences in T-bet and 
Eomes expression held for WT and IL-4Rα KO cells 
responding to LCMV in the same host animals, arguing 
for a cell-autonomous role for IL-4Rα expression in this 
system (Fig. 5 E). Thus, the impact of IL-4 sensitivity on 
T-bet/Eomes expression is carried into the effector phase 
of the antiviral response. 
Elevated T-bet expression levels are required for effec-
tive generation of SLECs, identified in LCMV infections by a 
CD127 
lo KLRG1 
hi phenotype, whereas MPECs identified as 
CD127 
hi KLRG1 
lo are more likely to survive contraction and 
develop into long-lived memory cells (Kaech et al., 2003). 
Hence, we also investigated whether the frequency of SLEC 
and MPEC populations (and other CD127/KLRG1-defined 
subsets) differed in LCMV-infected WT and IL-4Rα KO 
mice. At an effector stage time point, we observed reduced 
frequencies of SLEC phenotype cells and a modest increase 
in the frequency of MPEC phenotype cells in IL-4Rα KO 
animals (Fig. 5 F), although all antigen-specific IL-4Rα KO 
subpopulations were decreased in absolute numbers com-
pared with WT (not depicted). The changes in KLRG1/ 
CD127 expression were, however, not well recapitulated in 
the BM chimeras (Fig. 5 G), suggesting effects of IL-4Rα 
expression on cells other than CD8 
+ T cells may influence 
these phenotypic differences. </p>

<p>We next extended these data to a memory time point. 
Antigen-specific CD8 
+ T cells were isolated by peptide-
MHC tetramer enrichment from spleen and lymph nodes 
of WT, IL-4Rα KO, and mixed BM chimeras infected with 
LCMV at least 45 d previously. Fewer antigen-specific cells 
were recovered from the IL-4Rα KO CD8 
+ T cell popu-
lation relative to WT cells (Fig. 5, H and I). Note that the 
BM chimera approach allowed us to normalize the ratio 
of IL-4Rα KO and WT cells in the preimmune popula-
tion (Fig. 5 I, first column); hence, the dominance of WT 
over IL-4Rα KO antigen-specific memory CD8 
+ T cells in 
this case suggests a qualitative rather than quantitative dif-
ference in the capacity of LCMV-induced IL-4Rα CD8 </p>

<p>T cells to reach memory phase. 
These data suggest that differences in IL-4 sensitivity 
affect both the magnitude and quality of the CD8 
+ T cell 
immune response toward acute viral infection. </p>

<p>The impact of CD8 
+ T cell responsiveness to IL-4 
occurs before LCMV infection 
Although our data suggested that CD8 
+ T cell sensitivity to 
IL-4 was important for an optimal response to LCMV, it was 
not possible to determine whether this chiefly reflected a re-
quirement for IL-4 during the infection itself or whether the 
effects of IL-4 occurred before infection, by programming 
the preimmune CD8

To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed 
adoptive transfer experiments. Congenically distinct WT 
CD8 
+ T cells were transferred into either WT (IL-4 suffi-
cient) or IL-4 KO (IL-4 deficient) recipients. Engraftment 
was determined 1 d after adoptive transfer in some mice </p>

in both recipients (not depicted). 7 d after LCMV infection, 
we observed similar numbers of total and antigen-specific 
donor CD8

groups (Fig. 6, A and B). Additionally, no statistical differences 
in Eomes (Fig. 6 C) and T-bet (Fig. 6 D) were observed in 
WT antigen-specific CD8

during the immune response to LCMV is not required for an 
effective CD8

<p>
periments revealed no significant difference in the magnitude 
of the response of antigen-specific WT and IL-4Rα KO naive 
CD8 
+ T cells, in contrast to what might be expected were 
reactivity to IL-4 critical for driving expansion of LCMV-spe-
cific CD8 
+ T cells. Interestingly, the expansion of memory 
phenotype IL-4Rα KO donor cells was at least as great as that 
of their WT counterparts, and in many cases, this IL-4Rα KO 
population responded more vigorously than the WT popula-
tion (Fig. 6, E and F). These findings reinforce the conclusion 
that IL-4Rα engagement during the response to LCMV is 
not required to induce a strong proliferative response. Further-
more, these results suggest that memory phenotype IL-4Rα 
KO CD8 
+ T cells are not intrinsically defective in their in vivo 
response to LCMV but that their scarcity limits the overall 
magnitude of the response in IL-4Rα-deficient mice. 
Combined, these results strongly suggest that it is IL-4 
exposure during development and homeostasis that shapes 
the subsequent CD8 
+ T cell response to LCMV infection and 
that IL-4 conditioning primarily increases the quantity but 
not the quality of memory-like CD8 
+ T cells that participate 
in the immune response to LCMV. </p>

<p>DIS CUS SION 
Our data indicate that, in BALB/c mice, the response to 
steady-state levels of IL-4 substantially alters the CD8 
+ T 
cell pool. IL-4Rα-deficient mice had reduced total CD8 </p>

<p>+ </p>

<p>T cell numbers, chiefly arising because of a severe reduction 
in the frequency of memory phenotype cells (including vir-
tual memory cells specific for unencountered foreign anti-
gens). However, beyond these quantitative effects, qualitative 
changes in the CD8 
+ T cell pool were evident. Our previous 
study indicates that IL-4 exposure in the thymus resulted in 
high expression levels of the Eomes transcription factor (but 
not the related factor T-bet) in thymic memory phenotype 
CD8 
+ T cells (Weinreich et al., 2010). Peripheral memory 
phenotype CD8 
+ T cells in IL-4Rα KO mice were reduced 
in frequency and showed reduced Eomes expression. Surpris-
ingly, we also observed that IL-4 responsiveness correlated 
with heightened Eomes expression in all CD8 
+ T cells, in-
cluding phenotypically naive CD8 
+ T cells. A study by Carty 
et al. (2014) using C57BL/6 mice suggested that naive CD8 </p>

<p>+ </p>

<p>T cells do not up-regulate Eomes in response to IL-4 alone in 
vitro, but rather, Eomes could be induced by a combination </p>

<p>of IL-4 together with weak TCR stimulation. In contrast, in 
vivo treatment of mice with IL-4 complexes (which induce 
a heightened response to IL-4) could provoke naive CD8 </p>

<p>+ </p>

<p>T cell proliferation (Morris et al., 2009) and induce their 
acquisition of innate memory phenotype, including ele-
vated Eomes expression (Ventre et al., 2012). Hence, the 
elevated Eomes levels we observe in WT naive CD8 
+ T 
cells in BALB/c mice might arise because of sustained IL-
4Rα signals in the periphery or potentially be carried over 
from IL-4Rα stimulation during thymic differentiation; 
whether, in either case, basal TCR stimulation through self-
peptide-MHC interactions is required to preserve Eomes ex-
pression levels is unclear. 
Our experiments investigating the impact of IL-4Rα 
signals on functional responses of peripheral CD8 
+ T cell 
populations also led to unexpected findings. Although nu-
merically reduced, IL-4Rα-deficient memory phenotype 
CD8 
+ T cells showed significantly enhanced capacity to 
make IFN-γ and TNF compared with their WT counter-
parts. Furthermore, this functional superiority extended to 
the IL-4Rα-deficient naive and intermediate phenotype 
populations. On a per cell basis then, acute inflammatory cy-
tokine production is compromised rather than enhanced by 
developmental exposure to IL-4. This finding resonates with 
the long-established principle that IL-4Rα signals promote 
Th2 and impair Th1 cell differentiation. Likewise, we found 
that IL-4Rα-deficient memory phenotype CD8 
+ T cells 
exhibited enhanced not diminished expansion in response 
to LCMV infection when their numbers were normalized 
with WT cells through adoptive transfer. Hence, IL-4 appears 
to act to both increase the number of memory-like CD8 </p>

<p>+ </p>

<p>T cells while also reducing their individual capacity to elicit 
inflammatory cytokines in vitro and mount a robust response 
to viral infection in vivo. 
Because these data suggest that IL-4 sensitivity has both 
positive and negative effects on the quantity/quality of the 
CD8 
+ T cell pool, they raise the question of whether de-
velopmental exposure to IL-4 would improve or diminish 
the CD8 
+ T cell response to pathogens. Previous studies have 
indicated that some homeostatic memory-like CD8 
+ T cell 
populations are regulatory cells, capable of restraining CD4 </p>

<p>+ </p>

<p>and CD8 
+ T cell responses (Rifa'i et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2007;  Dai et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2010, 2011; Sakuraba et al., 2013). 
Published studies suggest loss of IL-4 sensitivity compromises 
the CD8 
+ T cell response to liver stage malaria (Carvalho et  al., 2002; Morrot et al., 2005). In our experiments, we found 
that loss of IL-4 sensitivity by the CD8 
+ T cell population led 
to diverse changes in the response to acute LCMV infection. 
The magnitude of the antigen-specific response was com-
promised in IL-4Rα-deficient mice, as was the production 
of effector cells expressing high levels of Eomes. Interpreting 
the basis for these changes in the intact IL-4Rα KO mice is 
complicated by the fact that these mice exhibit both slightly 
reduced numbers of preimmune CD8 
+ T cells and changes 
in gene expression and functional traits within the CD8 </p>

<p>+ </p>

<p>population. However, similar conclusions were reached from 
studies using mixed BM chimeras, in which the numbers of 
preimmune WT and IL-4Rα KO CD8 
+ T cells were nor-
malized. Collectively with the data discussed in the previous 
paragraph on the robust reactivity of memory phenotype IL-
4Rα KO CD8 
+ T cells, our data suggest that the impaired 
LCMV-specific response observed in IL-4Rα KO mice is 
chiefly caused by a deficit in the numbers rather than the 
intrinsic quality of memory phenotype CD8 
+ T cells. 
The chimera and adoptive transfer approaches also 
indicated that IL-4-dependent changes in the pre-and 
postimmune CD8 
+ T cell pool were dependent on IL-4 
sensitivity by the CD8 
+ T cell population itself. Further-
more, these data suggested that the effects of IL-4 reactivity 
occurred during T cell development or homeostasis, rather 
than during the response to pathogen infection, because we 
found no evidence for a role of IL-4 in supporting the re-
sponse to LCMV. Hence, our data are compatible with a 
model in which IL-4 induces altered thymic differentiation 
of CD8 
+ T cells, and these effects are maintained into the 
peripheral antigen-responsive pool. 
Collectively, our experiments suggest diverse effects of 
steady-state IL-4 exposure on CD8 
+ T cell subsets, gene ex-
pression, functional reactivity, and response to pathogens. Our 
findings indicate that IL-4 exposure may impair the intrinsic 
capacity of CD8 
+ T cells to rapidly produce IFN-γ and to 
mount a robust proliferative response to LCMV; yet, at the 
same time, IL-4 drives differentiation of significantly greater 
numbers of memory phenotype CD8 
+ T cells that participate 
effectively in Th1 responses. In this regard, our findings sug-
gest a need to reevaluate ways in which IL-4, the prototypical 
Th2 cell cytokine, may ironically improve rather than dimin-
ish proinflammatory immune responses. 
In this regard, a recent study (Lee et al., 2015) used 
distinct approaches to manipulate the frequency of IL-4-
induced memory-like cells in BALB/c mice and found 
that the presence of this population correlated with im-
proved control of LCMV cl13 (which can establish a 
chronic infection in mice). 
An important question is whether similar effects are 
mediated by IL-4 in humans. Populations of Eomes 
hi mem-
ory-like CD8 
+ T cells have been described in fetal humans 
(Min et al., 2011), and related subsets have been observed in 
adult humans (Jacomet et al., 2015). How variability in IL-4 
expression levels alters the frequency or characteristics of 
these CD8 
+ T cells is unclear. In a set of mouse strains, there 
was a correlation between the frequencies of IL-4-producing 
invariant NK T cells and thymic innate memory CD8 
+ T cells 
(Lee et al., 2013b). It is possible that humans with sustained 
elevated levels of IL-4 (e.g., individuals with atopic diseases 
or infection with pathogens inducing chronic Th2 responses) 
may undergo similar changes in the developing CD8 
+ T cell 
pool, which would promote balance in the immune system 
by increasing the numbers of cells competent to participate in 
type-1 immune responses. </p>

with collagenase D. Cells were labeled with PE-or APC-
conjugated tetramers, followed by magnetic enrichment over 
columns using anti-PE or anti-APC magnetic beads (Miltenyi 
Biotec). Enriched samples were stained with surface antibod-
ies, and AccuCheck counting beads (Invitrogen) were used 
for calculating cell number. </p>

<p>Surface and intracellular flow cytometry. Single-cell suspen-

purchased from eBioscience, BD, or Tonbo. LCMV NP 118-126 
and L. monocytogenes LLO 91-99 tetramers were provided by 
the National Institutes of Health Tetramer Facility. For intra-

immobilized anti-CD3 (145-2C11) and anti-CD28 (37.51) 
for 6-24 h. GolgiPlug (BD) was added for the final 4 h, before 
antibody staining. Cells were prepared for flow cytometry as </p>

<p>Abstract </p>

<p>Objectives: to investigate whether a difference exists between das28 from crP and das28 from 
esr in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and secondary sjögren's syndrome (sss). 
Material and methods: One group comprised patients with RA and sSS, the control group com-
prised patients with ra. the inclusion criteria for the ra and sss group have been specified as follows: 
presence of at least one symptom of dryness, and also presence of anti-SS-A and anti-SS-B or at least 
focus score of one in biopsy. 
Results: the disease activity score 28 (das28) was assessed using both esr and crP in 60 patients 
with ra and sss and 59 patients with ra alone. however, concordance between these two methods was 
good (cohen's κ coefficient κ = 0.60, 95% ci: 0.45-0.75 in the first group and κ = 0.71, 95% ci: 0.56-
0.86 in the control group). in the group with ra and sss, the mean value of das28-esr = 5.2, whereas 
the mean value of das28-crP = 4.7 (p &lt; 0.0001). in the group with ra alone, mean das28-esr = 
4.7 while mean das28-crP = 4.6; no significant difference was identified. moreover, in ra patients 
with sss, mean esr = 39 mm/h compared with mean crP at 25 mg/l. 79% of all patients demonstrated 
dysproteinaemia. there were connections between higher esr and dysproteinaemia. in the control 
group there was no statistically significant difference between crP and esr. 
Conclusions: Both das28-esr and das28-crP are useful outcome measures in ra. however, in 
patients with ra and sss, das28 should be evaluated based on crP. </p>

<p>Secondary Sjögren's syndrome (sSS) is classified as 
a connective tissue disease characterized mainly by xe-
rophthalmia and xerostomia, and accompanied by various 
autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 
systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, vasculitis, 
mixed connective tissue disease, primary biliary cirrhosis 
or autoimmune thyroiditis [1, 2]. 
To recognize the sSS presence, one subjective symp-
tom of sickness and positive results of two objective tests 
for dryness of eyes and mouth are required. The sSS can 
also be diagnosed without any sicca symptoms, but then 
the following three criteria should be met: positive results </p>

<p>of both objective tests, the presence of antibodies (anti-
SS-A/Ro and anti-SS-B/La), and inflammatory infiltration 
in biopsy of minor salivary glands [3]. 
Prevalence of sSS in RA varies considerably depend-
ing on the geographic region and duration of RA. For in-
stance, data from Norway show the lowest prevalence, i.e. 
7%, whereas data from Spain reveal a cumulative preva-
lence of 17% and 25% after 10 and 30 years of the disease, 
respectively [4]. According to Andonopoulos et al., 5% of 
RA patients had clinical manifestations of sSS and 20% 
demonstrated sub-clinical sSS [5]. 
Patients with secondary SS and RA require special 
attention regarding evaluation of specific systemic com-</p>

<p>plications like inflammatory pulmonary disease or poly-
neuropathy. 
DAS28 is an important outcome measure of RA activ-
ity. In a number of European countries, DAS28 is conclu-
sive in determining intensity of treatment. 
The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the dif-
ference in the values of the DAS28 calculated taking into 
account diverse parameters of inflammatory activity (ESR 
or CRP) is clinically relevant. In case the discrepancy is 
relevant, the study should indicate which parameter is 
more valuable for assessing activity of RA with sSS. </p>

<p>Material and methods </p>

<p>Patients </p>

<p>To capture data regarding the study we queried our 
medical records database of the Connective Tissue Disease 
Department in the Institute of Rheumatology in Warsaw 
from 2009 through 2011 seeking to identify all patients 
with RA and sSS. Initially, 1980 patients were identified 
with RA who had been diagnosed according to the Amer-
ican College of Rheumatology criteria laid down in 1987. 
We have separated 119 patients with RA. After a review of 
medical records, only patients with RA and sSS who had 
been diagnosed based on the 2002 revised version of the 
American-European Consensus Group criteria were select-
ed. Eventually, only 60 subjects registered with the ICD-10 
code for sSS and RA (M35.0 and M05) were included in 
the research group. 59 patients were in the control group 
with RA only. </p>

<p>Clinical and laboratory assessment </p>

<p>The data were extracted from medical records retro-
spectively based on their fulfilment of inclusion criteria 
for our study. The inclusion criteria have been specified 
as follows: 
• radiological confirmation of RA (criteria for RA), 
• presence of data on DAS28-CRP and DAS28-ESR, 
• presence of at least one subjective symptom of dry eyes 
or dry mouth (criteria for SS), 
• one objective symptom of dryness, 
• presence of specific antibodies SS-A and SS-B, 
• in biopsy at least focus score of one. 
Subjective ocular symptoms were usually described 
in the medical records as present or absent, and included 
symptoms of dry eyes lasting over 3 months, foreign object 
sensation in the eyes, or subjective oral symptoms such as 
symptoms of dry mouth lasting over 3 months or swollen 
salivary glands. The objective ocular test was performed 
using Schirmer's test. Schirmer's test without anaesthe-
sia consists in corneal staining assessment during over 
5 minutes and is performed with eyes closed by inserting 
a Schirmer filter paper strip into the eye and reading the </p>

<p>result after 5 minutes. The Schirmer test result is abnormal 
when during 5 minutes the tears flow is less than 5 mm. 
Furthermore, (SSA)/Ro and/or (SSB)/La was collected. 
In addition, histopathological examination of lymphocytic 
infiltration at salivary glands with at least focus score of 
one was performed. 
The evaluated medical records contained basic clinical 
laboratory tests and included rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-
cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies, as well as 
morphology, inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP), and 
proteinogram. Only patients with both DAS28-ESR and 
DAS28-CRP data available at baseline had been selected. 
DAS 28 embraces swollen joint counts (SJCs) and ten-
der joint counts (TJCs), a self-determined assessment of 
patient's general health on visual analogue scale (VAS) 
from 0 to 10, and acute-phase response factors ESR or 
CRP. According to EULAR recommendations, DAS28 
scores represent the following disease activities: remission 
(&lt; 2.6), mild (≥ 2.6, &lt; 3.2), moderate (≥ 3.2, &lt; 5.1) or 
severe (≥ 5.1). DAS28 values were calculated using the 
following equations: 
DAS28-CRP = 0.56_ˇ (TJC-28) + 0.28_ˇ (SJC-28) + 
0.014_GH+ 0.36_ln (CRP + 1) + 0.96, 
DAS28-ESR = 0.56_ˇ (TJC-28) + 0.28_ˇ (SJC-28) + 
0.014_GH+ 0.70_ln (ESR). </p>

<p>Statistical analysis </p>

<p>The following methods were used for statistical analy-
sis: STATISTICA release 10 from Stat Soft Poland, <rs id="software-1" type="software">SAS 
System</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">10.0</rs> <rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">SAS Institute Inc. Institute of Rheumatology</rs>, 
Warsaw, Poland. Normal distribution data have been pre-
sented as mean and standard deviations, whereas abnor-
mal distribution data as median and interquartile range. 
Depending on their distribution, data were analyzed using 
Student t-test or Mann-Whitney u test. P-values &lt; 0.05 
were considered statistically significant. Cohen's κ coeffi-
cient with linear weighting was used to measure agreement 
between DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP values. In order 
to assess the variation between DAS28-ESR and DAS28-
CRP, the Bland-Altman plot was used. </p>

<p>Results </p>

<p>119 out of 1980 patients registered in the Institute of 
Rheumatology database who suffer from RA have fulfilled 
inclusion criteria for the research study. One group com-
prised 60 patients with RA and sSS, second -the control 
group -patients with RA alone. In the patients with RA 
and sSS group, mean age was 57 (range: 33-81) years. 
There were 56 female participants (93%) and only 4 male 
(7%). Baseline characteristics of the patients are present-
ed in Table 1. The control group comprised 59 patients 
with RA. Mean age of the control group patients was 51.6 </p>

<p>(range: 23-77) years. There were also only 4 males and 
55 females. 
In the group of patients with RA and sSS, 50 out of 
60 patients (83%) have complained of dry eyes, of whom 
15 (25%) have complained of dry mouth also. Moreover, 
30 out of 52 patients (87%) have obtained a positive result 
of Schirmer test, i.e. less than &lt; 5 mm, 17 (33%) demon-
strated border tears flow, while only 9% normal tears flow. 
With regard to 8 patients, Schirmer's test data were un-
available. With reference to 52 out of 60 patients (87%), 
data of collected ANA antibodies indicated that 28 of them 
(54%) show positive ANA antibodies, 13 (26%) SSA/Ro 
antibodies, and 6 (12%) SSB/La antibodies. The salivary 
gland biopsy has been performed in 50 of our patients 
(83%), whereas 47 out of 50 (94%) obtained focus score 
of one and more than one. 
A group of 46 patients with RA and sSS (82%) demon-
strated a positive RF, however, for the remaining 4 patients </p>

<p>there were no data. Out of 31 patients (52%) with available 
data of anti-CCP antibodies, 28 (90%) presented positive 
anti-CCP antibodies. Divergently a group of RA patients 
from the control group reported a positive RF in 51% and 
positive antiCCP antibodies in 78%. 
It should be noted that in patients with RA and sSS, 
the mean value of ESR was 39 mm/hr, whereas of CRP, 
25 mg/l. On the contrary in RA patients the mean value of 
ESR was 15 mm/hr, and almost similar CRP -16 mg/l. 
Linear regression analysis revealed a significant cor-
relation between DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP -Pear-
son correlation coefficients r = 0.9, p &lt; 0.0001 (Fig. 1) in 
the first group of patients with RA and sSS. In the control 
group, there was the same correlation between DAS28-
ESR and DAS28-CRP -Pearson correlation coefficients 
r = 0.91, p &lt; 0.02 (Fig. 2). Moreover, agreement between 
DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP was good; Cohen's kappa 
coefficient with linear weighting κ = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.45-</p>

<p>0.75 in the RA and sSS group, and Bland-Altman analysis 
(Fig. 3) also shows good agreement between both methods. 
Despite this concordance, we found that in patients with 
RA and sSS, DAS28 calculated from ESR was significant-
ly higher than calculated from CRP. Mean DAS28-ESR = 
5.2, while mean DAS28-CRP = 4.7. A relevant difference 
was identified with p &lt; 0.0001. On the other hand, in the 
control group (patients with RA), mean DAS28-ESR= 4.7 
while mean DAS28-CRP = 4.6; no significant difference 
was identified with p &gt; 0.05 (p = 0.91). 
The patients were divided into 4 groups: with remis-
sion, low, medium and high disease activity score (see 
Table 2). In our study, in RA patients with sSS, DAS28-
ESR ≥ 5.1 has been reported in 33 patients (55%), while 
DAS28-CRP ≥ 5.1 in 23 patients (38%). Congruence be-
tween values obtained from ESR and CRP is shown in 
Table 2. Concordant values are presented in the diagonal 
of the table. Full agreement has been found for DAS28 
values calculated from CRP; for every DAS28-CRP ≥ 5.1, 
the DAS28-ESR is also ≥ 5.1. On the other hand, 10 pa-
tients for whom DAS28-CRP ranged from 3.2 to 5.1 had 
the DAS28-ESR value over 5.1. As a result, the biggest 
discrepancies were found for high DAS28 values, especial-
ly in the range from 3.2 to 5.1, and over 5.1. Compared to 
the control group, there are no large differences in the val-
ue of DAS28-CRP and DAS28-ESR between 2.6 and 5.1. 
DAS28-ESR ≥ 5.1 was measured in 25 patients (42.7%), 
while DAS28-CRP ≥ 5.1 in 29 patients (49%). </p>

<p>The objective of the study was to find a relationship 
between higher ESR and hypergammaglobulinemia in pa-
tients with RA and sSS. No statistically significant results 
were obtained in the case of higher ESR and hypergamma-
globulinemia, however, connections were found between 
higher ESR and dysproteinaemia. Patients with RA and 
sSS who presented dysproteinaemia obtained median ESR 
over 42 mm/h, whereas participants without dysprotein-
aemia had lower median ESR, only 22 mm/h (p &lt; 0.011) 
(Table 3). </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>This study evaluating 60 patients with RA with sSS 
revealed that values of DAS28-CRP are significantly low-
er than those of DAS28-ESR. Discrepancies were found 
in patients with moderate disease activity (DAS28 from 
3.2 to 5.1) (DAS28-CRP -30 patients, DAS28-ESR -23 
patients) and a high disease activity score (DAS28 above 
5.1) (DAS28-CRP -23 patients, DAS28-ESR -33 pa-
tients). These observations have implications for clinical 
evaluations since a high disease activity score qualifies pa-
tients for biological treatment. The afore-mentioned find-
ings change the therapeutic approach, hence, this study is 
aimed to prove that patients with RA and sSS have differ-
ent outcomes in assessment from DAS28-ESR than from 
DAS28-CRP and, therefore, evaluations from DAS28-
CRP are recommended. </p>

<p>In several previous studies [6-9], DAS28 from CRP 
and DAS28 from ESR were compared. Fransen et al. [9] 
reported that not only the DAS28-CRP 4.38 [SD 1.47] 
and DAS 28 ESR 4.41 [SD 1.27] are similar, but also that 
CRP could be replaced by ESR. According to Wells et 
al. [6], most patients were classified as having the same 
EULAR state regardless of which DAS28 definition has 
been employed. Moreover, Inoue et al. [8] have shown 
that DAS28-CRP can be used as an alternative to the 
DAS28-ESR given the strong linear relationship between 
DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP values (correlation coeffi-
cient 0.946) [8]. By contrast, in our research group, the 
said correlation coefficient is equal to only 0.73. In com-
parison to his predecessors, Matsui et al. [7] demonstrated 
that DAS28-CRP significantly underestimated disease ac-
tivity and overestimated the improvement in disease activ-
ity compared with DAS28-ESR. Our study has revealed </p>

<p>that the mean value of DAS28-CRP (4.71, SD 1.2) was 
significantly smaller than the mean value of DAS28-ESR 
(5.27, SD 1.32) (p &lt; 0.0001) in a group with RA and sSS 
(Table 1). There were no significant statistical correlations 
in the control group with RA. Nevertheless, the changes of 
DAS28 values in DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP in both 
groups were very similar and closely correlated. Although 
the values of DAS28-ESR and those of DAS28-CRP were 
comparable in the reports of Wells et al. [6] and Fransen 
et al. [9], our study did not show similar results (Table 2). 
In contrast with the previous research, this study covers 
a different group of patients than the statistical rheuma-
toid patients. In our research, not only patients with RA 
have undergone examination, but also those with sSS. 
That syndrome is responsible for changes in immunoglob-
ulin, especially activation of polyclonal B-cell leading to 
chronic hypergammaglobulinemia and increased levels </p>

<p>of b2-microglobulinemia [10] which affect the ESR and 
cause higher ESR. Apart from the aforementioned, ESR 
can also be affected by such factors as sex, age, immuno-
globulin levels, and abnormal size or shape of red blood 
cells. In chronic diseases, the ESR-elevation is considered 
to be caused by fibrinogen, mono-or polyclonal increase 
in IgG, IgA, and IgM, alone or in combinations [11]. Nor-
mal values of ESR for females are higher than for males 
and increase with age. Due to the fact that the study group 
was dominated by women (93%), that factor could possi-
bly have influenced the results. 
In an inflammatory process, the high proportion of 
fibrinogen in the blood causes red blood cells to stick 
to each other. The red cells form stacks called rouleaux 
which settle faster in ESR. Fibrinogen is considered to be 
responsible for the rouleaux phenomenon, however, it has 
a co-influence on immunoglobulin to induce the rouleaux 
type of aggregates and high ESR. High ESR is a result of 
either rouleaux type aggregates where fibrinogen is dom-
inant, or immunologic type aggregates where IgG, IgA or 
IgM are the dominant proteins [12, 13]. On the other hand, 
total leukocyte and absolute neutrophil counts are not cor-
related with either ESR or haematocrit standardised ESR. 
A strong correlation (r = 0.75) was found between fibrin-
ogen levels and haematocrit standardised ESR [14]. In our 
study this correlation has not been measured. However, 
in our study polyclonal gammopathy and dysproteinaemia 
were reported. Serum protein electrophoresis is a labora-
tory examination that is commonly used to identify two 
major types of proteins: albumin and globulins. The five 
components (globulins) are labeled α 1 , α 2 , b 1 , b 2 , and γ. 
Dysproteinaemia in our study means an abnormality of 
the protein content of the blood, involving the immuno-
globulins (α, b and γ globulins). Polyclonal gammopathy 
can be observed in patients with SS. Polyclonal hypergam-
maglobulinemia and elevated α 2 -globulins are often seen. 
In our study 46% of patients demonstrated hypergamma-
globulinemia and 69% dysproteinaemia, hence, higher 
ESR can be determined by this pathology. A retrospective 
cohort study of 148 patients from the Mayo Clinic showed 
that in patients with RA, γ globulin levels are elevated in 
37% of patients, and are reported to correlate with dis-
ease activity [16]. Our study also revealed that patients 
with dysproteinaemia have higher ESR, what proved to be 
a significant correlated factor. Furthermore, ESR tends to 
show the disease activity over the course of a few weeks, 
whereas CRP can develop more short-term changes in the 
disease activity. Moreover, CRP is less dependable on sex, 
age, and fibrinogen and immunoglobulin levels [15]. Thus, 
CRP tends to be a better factor than ESR. </p>

<p>Conclusions </p>

<p>In conclusion, both DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP are 
useful outcome measures in RA. However, our study pro-</p>

<p>vides evidence that in patients with RA and sSS, DAS28 
should be evaluated based on CRP. </p>

<p>Key messages </p>

<p>Both DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP are useful out-
come measures in RA. Although our results are based on 
small numbers, they confirm that in patients with RA and 
sSS, DAS28 should be evaluated from CRP. </p>

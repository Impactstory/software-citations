<p>Background: In the last 4 years, four novel oral anticoagulants have been developed as alterna-</p>

<p>tives to warfarin and antiplatelet agents for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. 
The objective of this review was to estimate the comparative effectiveness of all antithrombotic 
treatments for AF patients. 
Materials and methods: Data sources were Medline Ovid (1946 to October 2015), Embase Ovid </p>

<p>(1980 to October 2015), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL, Issue 
9, 2015). Randomized controlled trials of AF patients were selected if they compared at least two of 
the following: placebo, aspirin, aspirin and clopidogrel combination therapy, adjusted-dose warfarin 
(target international normalized ratio 2.0-3.0), dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. 
Bayesian network meta-analyses were conducted for outcomes of interest (all stroke, ischemic 
stroke, myocardial infarction, overall mortality, major bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage). 
Results: Based on 16 randomized controlled trials of 96,826 patients, all oral anticoagulants </p>

<p>were more effective than antiplatelet agents at reducing the risk of ischemic stroke and all strokes. 
Compared to warfarin, dabigatran 150 mg (rate ratio 0.65, 95% credible interval 0.52-0.82) 
and apixaban (rate ratio 0.82, 95% credible interval 0.69-0.97) reduced the risk of all strokes. 
Dabigatran 150 mg was also more effective than warfarin at reducing ischemic stroke risk 
(rate ratio 0.76, 95% credible interval 0.59-0.99). Aspirin, apixaban, dabigatran 110 mg, and 
edoxaban were associated with less major bleeding than warfarin. 
Conclusion: All oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke in AF patients. Some novel oral </p>

<p>anticoagulants are associated with a lower stroke and/or major bleeding risk than warfarin. In addi-
tion to the safety and effectiveness of drug therapy, as reported in this study, individual treatment 
recommendations should also consider the patient's underlying stroke and bleeding risk profile. 
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and affects 
between 0.5% and 2% of the population in Western countries. AF is also a growing 
health problem in developing countries, concordant with the increasing health burden 
of other chronic noncommunicable diseases. 1 
AF is associated with significant morbidity and a high risk of ischemic stroke. AF 
patients are five times more likely to experience an ischemic stroke than the general 
population, with 20% of patients dying within 1 year after stroke and 60% being left 
with a disability. 2 Therefore, the majority of patients with AF must be on antithrombotic </p>

<p>treatment for stroke prevention for the remainder of their 
lives. Patients are prescribed either antiplatelet drugs or 
oral anticoagulants (OACs) as antithrombotic therapy. As a 
result of the increased risk of bleeding associated with these 
agents, the benefits of treatment must be carefully weighed 
against the risks. Patients at low risk of stroke are typically 
prescribed antiplatelet drugs or in some cases no treatment. 
Similarly, patients at moderate-to-high risk of stroke are 
typically prescribed OACs, but may be prescribed antiplatelet 
drugs or even nothing. 3-5 </p>

<p>Rationale </p>

<p>For 50 years, warfarin was the only OAC indicated for anti-
thrombotic therapy in AF patients. With the advent of the 
direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the direct factor Xa 
inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban (collectively 
called novel OACs [NOACs]), physicians and reimbursement 
decision makers are faced with a complex decision when 
selecting the optimal treatment for these patients. This deci-
sion is further complicated by the fact that new interventions 
are commonly compared with standardized therapies or 
placebo. 6-9 Head-to-head trials are rarely conducted, because 
of the regulatory, budgetary, and time constraints faced by 
manufacturers. 
Network meta-analyses (NMAs; also called mixed-treat-
ment comparisons) allow for the comparison of all interven-
tions, including those for which head-to-head comparisons 
have not been conducted. 10,11 NMA is an extension of tradi-
tional meta-analysis, whereby multiple pairwise comparisons 
are conducted, involving three or more interventions. 11 The 
advantages of NMAs are that they supplement direct esti-
mates of relative efficacy with indirect estimates and provide 
indirect estimates where direct estimates are not available. </p>

<p>Objectives </p>

<p>The aim of this study was to compare the relative effective-
ness and safety of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]), ASA 
and clopidogrel combination therapy (ASA + C), dose-
adjusted warfarin, dabigatran 110 mg, dabigatran 150 mg, 
rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban high dose (HD), edoxaban 
low dose (LD), and placebo in AF patients, using a Bayesian 
NMA approach. </p>

<p>Materials and methods 
Information sources </p>

<p>Relevant studies were identified through a search of Medline 
Ovid (1946 to October 2015), Embase Ovid (1980 to October 
2015), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials </p>

<p>(CENTRAL, Issue 9, 2015) in October 2015. The search 
strategy was developed and conducted by an information 
specialist (JB), using validated randomized controlled trial 
(RCT) search filters in Medline and Embase, and by adapting 
the Medline filter for use in the Cochrane register. 12,13 The 
search was conducted using the following terms and their 
derivatives: atrial fibrillation, warfarin, phenprocoumon, 
acenocoumarol, aspirin, apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, 
clopidogrel, edoxaban. The search was limited to English-
language studies published from 1988 onward. The identified 
articles were scanned for further eligible studies, and experts 
in the field were consulted to identify unpublished studies. 
Trial briefing documents for the NOACs were also located 
online to provide data not included in the published RCTs. A 
protocol was developed and reviewed as part of thesis work, 
but not registered; the protocol is available from the authors 
upon request. The full Medline search strategy is available 
in Supplementary material. </p>

<p>Study selection and eligibility criteria </p>

<p>All titles and abstracts were initially screened by one inves-
tigator (AT) to identify potentially relevant studies for inclu-
sion. Relevant studies were retrieved in full text, and were 
reassessed by two investigators (AT and PP) to determine 
eligibility for inclusion. For a study to be included in our 
analysis, it had to be a Phase III RCT of patients of any 
age with AF, comparing at least two of the antithrombotic 
treatments under investigation, or placebo. If a comparison 
included warfarin, it must have been administered at a target 
international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0-3.0 to reflect 
current standard practice. Inconsistencies between the two 
investigators were resolved by discussion and review of 
the material. </p>

<p>Data collection and items </p>

<p>The same investigators (AT and PP) independently extracted 
data from each study on the following outcomes: number of 
strokes of any type (ischemic, hemorrhagic, or unspecified), 
ischemic strokes, myocardial infarctions (MIs), all-cause 
deaths, major bleeds, and intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs). 
Mean values of the following variables were also extracted: 
duration of follow-up, age, sex, time in therapeutic range 
(TTR), and CHADS 2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, 
age â‰¥75 years, diabetes, previous stroke/transient ischemic 
attack) score. Also, the proportion of patients in each study 
with a history of stroke/transient ischemic attack, hyperten-
sion, MI, heart failure, and diabetes was extracted. Medians 
were used where means were not reported. </p>

<p>Risk of bias </p>

<p>Risk of bias in the included studies with respect to sequence 
generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete 
outcome data, and selective reporting was assessed using 
the Cochrane Collaboration's risk-of-bias assessment 
tool. 14 As recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration, 
all studies independent of their quality were included in 
the analysis. </p>

<p>Statistical analysis </p>

<p>Meta-analyses were used to synthesize RCT evidence for the 
direct comparisons, and NMAs were conducted to estimate 
relative effectiveness (as rate ratios) and credible intervals 
(CrIs) across all treatments for each outcome. Poisson mod-
els were used to adjust for possible differences in duration 
of follow-up between treatments and multiple outcomes per 
patient. A hierarchical Bayesian approach was followed, 
and models were fitted using Markov chain Monte Carlo 
simulations. 15 Data were analyzed using fixed-and random-
effect models, and prior distributions for each parameter of 
interest were assumed. For relative-effectiveness estimates, 
a vague normal prior probability (n 0,1,000 ) was assumed. 
For the random-effect model, a Î³-distribution (Î³ 0.001 ) was 
used as a prior for the precision (inverse of the variance) 
parameter. The decision to use either a random-effect or 
fixed-effect model was based on clinical considerations, 
model convergence, and goodness of fit, as measured by 
the deviance information criterion. Studies with no events 
in any arm for a particular outcome were excluded from 
that outcome's network of studies. All models were run 
until convergence was reached. Convergence was assessed 
through inspection of trace plots, consideration of potential 
scale-reduction factors, and inspection of multiple chains 
with different initial values. 
Consistency, a key assumption underlying NMAs, 
requires that any differences between direct and indirect esti-
mates are due to chance. 11 Consistency was assessed through 
the inspection of coherence plots. 16 Evidence of inconsistency 
was observed when CrIs around relative-effectiveness esti-
mates did not cross 1. All analyses were performed using 
R version 2.14.1 statistical software (R Development Core 
Team, Vienna, Austria) and <rs id="software-0" type="software">WinBUGS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">version 1.4</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">MRC Biostatistics Unit</rs>, Cambridge, UK). 
Interventions were compared based on the following out-
comes: all strokes, ischemic stroke, MI, major bleeding, ICH, 
and overall mortality. For each outcome, treatment options 
were ranked at every iteration according to their effectiveness 
from best to worst. Ranking distributions, representing the </p>

<p>proportions of iterations in which each treatment was ranked 
in position from first to tenth, were then estimated. 
Differences between treatments were judged to be 
statistically significant when CrIs of risk ratios did not 
overlap 1. Differences were judged to be of borderline 
statistically significant when a boundary of the confidence 
interval equaled 1. Otherwise, differences were interpreted 
as nonsignificant. </p>

<p>Sensitivity analysis </p>

<p>Any RCTs investigating the effectiveness of antithrombotic 
treatments in AF patients deemed ineligible for warfarin 
were excluded in a sensitivity analysis. Criteria used to 
determine patient ineligibility for warfarin were highly vari-
able across studies. The main criteria for ineligibility were 
patient or physician unwillingness due to fear of inadequate 
coagulation monitoring (or poor compliance), increased risk 
of hemorrhage, decreased risk of stroke due to the absence 
of other cardiovascular diseases, advanced age, and alcohol-
ism. Given that patient and physician unwillingness to take 
or prescribe warfarin is a subjective eligibility criterion and 
that baseline characteristics of patients deemed ineligible for 
warfarin did not differ significantly from those of eligible 
patients, the distinction between these two patient groups is 
unclear. 17 Therefore, we sought to determine whether their 
exclusion from the analysis would affect the results. We 
also examined the sensitivity of the results to assumptions 
related to the specification of prior distributions, by using 
vague uniform priors (U -10,10 ) for all log relative effectiveness 
estimates. </p>

<p>Results 
Systematic review and network of 
evidence </p>

<p>A total of 5,353 potentially relevant titles were identified 
through the systematic review. After our exclusion criteria 
were applied, 20 articles reporting on 16 Phase III RCTs in 
English were selected (Figure 1). 6-9,18-33 Four of the RCTs 
were conducted on patients ineligible for warfarin, 9,18,25,31 and 
were excluded in a sensitivity analysis. A diagram illustrat-
ing the networks of evidence in the base-case and sensitivity 
analysis can be found in Figure 2. 
Overall, eleven studies were assessed to be at low risk, 
four at unclear risk, and one at high risk of bias. All analyses 
were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, except for 
two studies in which the method of analysis could not be 
determined. A more detailed description of bias assessment 
can be found in Table 1. </p>

<p>respectively. Fixed-effect models were used for all outcomes, 
because they provided similar goodness of fit to the random-
effect models, and the impact of the prior distributions on 
between-study variance in the random-effect models was 
too large. </p>

<p>All strokes </p>

<p>Dabigatran 150 mg and apixaban were the only NOACs that 
were superior to warfarin at reducing stroke of any type. All 
OACs were superior to ASA + C, ASA, and placebo, except 
for edoxaban LD, which was not significantly superior to ASA 
+ C. ASA + C was superior to ASA alone and placebo, while </p>

<p>ASA was only borderline superior to placebo. </p>

<p>Ischemic stroke </p>

<p>Dabigatran 150 mg was the only NOAC that was superior to 
warfarin at reducing ischemic stroke. Edoxaban LD was infe-
rior to all other OACs, with the exception of dabigatran 110 
mg. All OACs were superior to ASA + C, ASA, and placebo, 
except for edoxaban LD, which was not significantly superior 
to ASA + C. ASA and ASA + C were superior to placebo. </p>

<p>Myocardial infarction </p>

<p>Rivaroxaban was superior to dabigatran 110 mg at reducing 
MIs, borderline superior to placebo, and inferior to edoxa-
ban LD. </p>

<p>Overall mortality </p>

<p>Apixaban and edoxaban LD offered mortality advantages 
over warfarin, ASA, and placebo. Also, dabigatran 150 mg 
was superior to placebo, while dabigatran 110 mg and edoxa-
ban HD were only borderline superior to placebo. </p>

<p>Major bleeding </p>

<p>The following NOACs lowered the risk of major bleeding 
when compared to warfarin: apixaban, both doses of edoxa-
ban, and dabigatran 110 mg. Warfarin was associated with a 
higher risk than ASA and a borderline higher risk than pla-
cebo. All treatments, except for warfarin, dabigatran 150 mg, 
and rivaroxaban, were associated with a lower risk than ASA 
+ C. Edoxaban LD demonstrated a lower risk than apixaban, </p>

<p>with both demonstrating a lower risk than dabigatran 150 mg. 
Finally, rivaroxaban was associated with a higher risk than all 
the other NOACs, with the exception of dabigatran 150 mg. </p>

<p>Intracranial hemorrhage </p>

<p>The risk of ICH on warfarin was higher than that of all other 
treatment options, with the exception of ASA and ASA + C. </p>

<p>Study and patient characteristics </p>

<p>The selected RCTs included 96,826 patients followed for 
184,370 patient-years. The average age of patients in the 
RCTs was 71.3 years. The studies in which mean CHADS 2 
scores were reported accounted for 94% of the total number 
of patients in the analysis, and all reported a mean score of 
2 or more (ie, patients in the studies were on average at high 
risk for stroke). Patients in studies including warfarin as a 
comparator had a weighted average TTR of 62.5%. The main 
study characteristics are included in Table 2, and patient 
characteristics are included in Table 3. </p>

<p>ASA + C was associated with a higher risk than all other 
treatment options. The risk of ICH on ASA was higher than 
on placebo. Finally, the risk of ICH on rivaroxaban was higher 
than that of dabigatran 110 mg and edoxaban LD. </p>

<p>Ranking and inconsistency </p>

<p>The ranking distributions in Figure 3 represent the propor-
tions of simulations in which each treatment was ranked in 
each position (from best to worst) based on its effectiveness 
against ischemic stroke and major bleeding. For ischemic 
stroke, dabigatran 150 mg was shown to be the most effective </p>

<p>option in 84% of simulations, followed by rivaroxaban 
(9%), apixaban (5%), and edoxaban HD (2%). None of the 
other treatments was the most effective option in any of the 
simulations. For major bleeding, edoxaban LD was the most 
effective option in 72% of simulations, followed by placebo 
(28%). None of the other treatments was the most effective 
option in any of the simulations. Although the risk of major 
bleeding on any OAC is higher than that on placebo, data 
on major bleeding while on placebo are scarce (ie, very 
few events occurring in smaller studies), resulting in weak 
evidence for this outcome on placebo. Through inspection </p>

<p>Stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation </p>

<p>of coherence plots, there was no evidence of inconsistency 
in any of the closed loops in the NMAs. </p>

<p>Sensitivity analysis </p>

<p>Exclusion of the four studies in the sensitivity analysis 
decreased the total number of patients and patient-years to 
81,771 and 150,589, respectively. The results of the NMAs 
using this smaller study set are presented in Table 6. There 
were some differences between the results of the base-case 
and sensitivity analyses. Notably, ASA + C combination ther-
apy was no longer superior to ASA and placebo at reducing 
both ischemic and all strokes. Similarly, ASA was no longer 
superior to placebo at reducing ischemic and all strokes. In 
contrast, edoxaban LD was superior to ASA + C at reducing </p>

<p>ischemic and all strokes, only borderline superior to ASA 
at reducing all strokes, and no longer superior to placebo 
at reducing ischemic strokes. Rivaroxaban was superior to 
dabigatran 150 mg at reducing MIs, and no longer border-
line superior to placebo. Apixaban showed only a borderline 
reduction in overall mortality over warfarin, and no treatment 
showed any mortality advantage over ASA or placebo. 
The risk of major bleeding on ASA was no longer lower 
than that on warfarin, ASA + C, or rivaroxaban, but was 
lower than that on apixaban. Also, the risk of major bleeding 
on dabigatran 150 mg was higher than that on placebo. The 
risk of major bleeding on placebo was lower than that on 
warfarin and ASA. The risk of ICH on placebo, dabigatran 
110 mg, and edoxaban LD was no longer lower than the risk </p>

<p>on ASA. When prior assumptions were varied, we found no 
significant deviations in the relative effectiveness estimates 
in any NMAs. </p>

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>In this analysis, we observed that most OACs were superior 
to antiplatelet agents and placebo in reducing ischemic and 
overall stroke risk, but results for risk of bleeding were mixed. 
Overall, we observed a reduction in ICHs with the NOACs 
when compared to warfarin. Although dabigatran 150 mg 
was shown to be superior to warfarin at reducing ischemic 
strokes, apixaban and edoxaban LD were the only treatments 
to demonstrate a mortality advantage over warfarin. Given 
that apixaban and edoxaban LD are associated with a lower 
major-bleeding risk than warfarin, these results may be an 
indication that overall mortality is driven more by major 
bleeding than ischemic stroke in AF patients. 
One advantage of using a Bayesian NMA approach is the 
ability to rank treatments. This is in contrast to traditional 
meta-analysis, which must assume a class effect. 34 Our 
ranking results have implications for clinical practice. For 
example, if a patient's bleeding risk is higher than their risk 
of ischemic stroke, but their risk of ischemic stroke is high 
enough to require an OAC, apixaban may be a better option 
for them than dabigatran 150 mg. If a patient's bleeding risk 
is very high, they might benefit from being on edoxaban 
LD or even no treatment, as edoxaban LD and placebo were 
ranked as the preferred options in reducing the risk of major 
bleeding. 
When studies of patients ineligible for warfarin were 
excluded from the analysis, some important differences 
were observed. Since the excluded studies looked at ASA, 
apixaban, and placebo, there was less evidence for these </p>

<p>treatments in the sensitivity analyses. This resulted in greater 
uncertainty around the relative-effectiveness estimates for 
these treatments. Additionally, ASA was shown to have a less 
favorable risk of major bleeding than that observed when all 
studies were included. 
Although other NMAs have been conducted in this 
therapeutic area, we believe our study offers some unique 
insights, including reporting on a broader range of outcomes 
and inclusion of all existing treatments indicated for stroke 
prevention in AF patients. To the best of our knowledge, 
there exist four other NMAs comparing older treatments 
(placebo, antiplatelet drugs, warfarin) to some or all of the 
NOACs that address similar clinical questions in the same 
study population. 35-38 Only one study included the Phase III 
trial of edoxaban. 35 In this study, which had results similar to 
ours, ischemic stroke was not reported as a separate outcome. 
One previous NMA 37 did not include edoxaban as a 
comparator, and had several results inconsistent with our 
analysis. The most important difference was that the authors 
found dabigatran 150 mg and apixaban to be more effective 
at reducing stroke than warfarin, but did not achieve a level 
of statistical significance as in our study. Another NMA 36 
included Phase II trials of edoxaban, and found no significant 
differences between interventions in the risk of major bleed-
ing or ICH, whereas our analysis found these differences to 
be significant. The authors of both published studies aimed to 
reflect current practice patterns by excluding trials or study 
arms where warfarin was administered at nonstandard doses. 
However, studies in which warfarin was administered outside 
of the standard target INR range of 2.0-3.0 were included in 
both. By including these studies in their analyses, warfarin's 
effectiveness may be under or overestimated, since overco-
agulation can lead to less bleeding but more ischemic strokes, </p>

<p>Notes: *Sensitivity analysis includes results for patients suitable for warfarin only. Results presented as rate ratios, with 95% credible intervals in parentheses below. 
Significant results are in bold.

<p>and undercoagulation can lead to fewer ischemic strokes but 
more bleeding. This difference in included studies, coupled 
with differences in the choice of statistical models used, may 
explain inconsistencies between results. 
There exist numerous published NMAs comparing the 
NOACs with each other. 39-46 Overall, the results of these 
studies align well with ours, but these are only a subset of the 
treatments included in our analysis. Only one study included 
the Phase III trial results of edoxaban, but the authors looked 
at individual and pooled relative-effectiveness estimates of 
the NOACs compared to warfarin, and did not compare the 
NOACs with each other. 46 
This analysis has several limitations. As with any meta-
analysis, NMAs are based on many simplifying assumptions. 
Although we assumed homogeneity of patient populations, </p>

<p>the patients in the trials upon which we based our analysis 
were heterogeneous, particularly with respect to stroke and 
bleeding risk. For example, the average CHADS 2 score of 
patients in the ROCKET-AF study was 3.5, which is signifi-
cantly higher than that of most of the other studies, which 
was around 2. Generally, the trials were heterogeneous in 
terms of the definitions used for major bleeding, concomitant 
treatments allowed by protocols, discontinuation rates, and 
TTR for patients in the warfarin arms. 
Other limitations related to patient characteristics may 
make using our findings for clinical decisions a challenge. 
For example, trials comparing ASA, placebo, and warfarin to 
each other are relatively old, and may not reflect the patients 
or outcomes seen today. These include high proportions of 
patients with valvular disease who are at much higher risk </p>

<p>of stroke than those with nonvalvular disease. 46 Additionally, 
as patient INRs may not be monitored as closely in practice 
as they are in clinical trials, the effectiveness of other treat-
ments when compared to warfarin in clinical trials may be 
underestimated. 47 
A final limitation is the inclusion of only English-lan-
guage studies, although there is currently a lack of evidence 
that excluding non-English studies from published systematic 
reviews of interventions in conventional medicine leads to 
biased estimates of an intervention's effectiveness. 47 
In conclusion, in the absence of head-to-head RCTs of 
antithrombotic treatments in patients with AF, we can only 
estimate their relative effectiveness indirectly. This NMA 
supports the use of OACs over antiplatelet agents or no 
treatment for stroke prevention in AF patients, following 
careful consideration of their bleeding risk. Each treatment 
option compared in this analysis is associated with a unique 
safety and efficacy profile, but this alone does not suffice to 
make an individual treatment decision. Our results further 
confirm the difficulty in balancing the risk of ischemic stroke 
with that of bleeding associated with stroke prevention in 
AF patients. Decision-analytic models may assist in provid-
ing additional guidance for classes of patients with varying 
stroke and bleeding risk. This approach allows for a formal 
consideration of risk, benefit, and cost; factors that are all 
important in determining the optimal approach to managing 
this very challenging condition. </p>

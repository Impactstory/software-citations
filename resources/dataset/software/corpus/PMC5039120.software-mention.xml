<p>Background: We investigated the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and cancer screening in a Kore-
an population aged 40 years or older. 
Methods: This cross-sectional study included 12,303 participants (5,284 men and 7,019 women) who participated 
in the 2010-2012 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Self-reported questionnaires were 
used to assess participant's SES (household income, occupational, and educational status) and cancer screening 
behavior. 
Results: Compared to the lowest household income group, the odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) 
for overall cancer screening of the highest income group were 2.113 (1.606-2.781) in men and 1.476 (1.157-1.883) 
in women; those for private cancer screening of the highest income group were 2.446 (1.800-3.324) in men and 
2.630 (2.050-3.373) in women, while those for National Cancer Screening Programs (NCSP) in the highest income 
group were 1.076 (0.805-1.439) in men and 0.492 (0.388-0.623) in women. Compared to manual workers, ORs (95% 
CIs) for private cancer screening of office workers were 1.300 (1.018-1.660) in men and 0.822 (0.616-1.098) in wom-
en. In comparison to the least educated men, OR (95% CI) for private cancer screening of the most educated men 
was statistically significant (1.530 [1.117-2.095]). 
Conclusion: Higher economic status was associated with higher rates of overall and private cancer screening in 
both sexes and a lower rate of NCSP in women. Male office workers and more educated individuals underwent pri-
vate cancer screening at a higher rate than manual workers and less educated individuals, respectively. </p>

<p>In South Korea, malignant neoplasm is a leading cause of death and its </p>

<p>incidence has steadily increased over a number of years. According to </p>

<p>the annual report on the causes of death from Statistics Korea, an over-</p>

<p>whelming majority of the Korean patients who died from malignant </p>

<p>neoplasm in 2013 were over 40 years of age. 1) The age-standardized </p>

<p>cancer incidence rates per 100,000 were 343.6 in men and 316.7 in </p>

<p>women, which are similar to or higher than those of other developed </p>

<p>countries (USA, 347.0 in men and 297.4 in women; UK, 284.0 in men </p>

<p>and 267.3 in women; Japan, 260.4 in men and 185.7 in women) and </p>

<p>are steadily growing. 1,2) Although the best choice to reduce cancer </p>

<p>mortality is prevention, the second best option appears to be detection </p>

<p>of cancer at an early stage. South Korea has National Cancer Screening </p>

<p>Programs (NCSP) that have been operating since 1999 and have pro-</p>

<p>vided a targeted population with free screening for five common can-</p>

<p>cers in Korea, including stomach, liver, colorectum, breast, and uterine </p>

<p>cervix, every two years. </p>

<p>Socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with various types of can-</p>

<p>cer incidence and morbidities/mortalities, including cancer-related </p>

<p>problems. 3) In addition, it appears that SES affects health behaviors </p>

<p>such as alcohol consumption, physical activity, cigarette-smoking, and </p>

<p>dietary patterns, which are closely related to cancer development and </p>

<p>outcomes. 3-5) Socioeconomic deprivation results in reduced access to </p>

<p>healthcare, which is a barrier to early detection of cancer and, thus, to </p>

<p>better outcomes. 6) Individuals with a low SES seem to be more suscep-</p>

<p>tible to exposure to unhealthy foods, such as high-calorie but poor-nu-</p>

<p>trition foods. Unhealthy environments play an important role in the </p>

<p>development and progression of serious diseases such as malignant </p>

<p>neoplasm, resulting in poor prognosis. </p>

<p>Identifying an association between SES and participation in cancer </p>

<p>screening can be helpful for developing a health policy and distribut-</p>

<p>ing limited public health resources fairly and efficiently. The aim of </p>

<p>this study was to investigate the association of SES (household income, </p>

<p>occupational, and educational status) with cancer screening in a Kore-</p>

<p>an population over 40 years in age, after accounting for age and other </p>

<p>confounding factors. In addition, we examined the relation of each </p>

<p>SES to participation in private cancer screening and NCSP. </p>

<p>METHODS </p>

<p>1. Study Population </p>

<p>The Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare periodically conducts the </p>

<p>Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey </p>

<p>(KNHANES), which is a nationwide survey representing the entire Ko-</p>

<p>rean population. This survey includes comprehensive information on </p>

<p>health status, health behavior, socioeconomic demographics, and lab-</p>

<p>oratory test results. Households were selected as the sampling units </p>

<p>based on a stratified, multistage, probability-sampling design accord-</p>

<p>ing to age, sex, and geographic area. Participants were asked to com-</p>

<p>plete four types of questionnaires which are composed of a health in-</p>

<p>terview, health behavior, health examination, and nutrition. Trained </p>

<p>interviewers performed face-to-face health interviews at participants' </p>

<p>houses. Citizens could refuse to participate in this survey according to </p>

<p>the National Health Enhancement Act. Written informed consent was </p>

<p>provided by participants. For further research, the Korea Centers for </p>

<p>Disease Control and Prevention acquired participants' consent to use </p>

<p>blood samples obtained during the health interview survey. Trained </p>

<p>staff followed standardized steps to conduct the unified procedures. </p>

<p>Body weight and height were measured to the nearest 0.1 kg and 0.1 </p>

<p>cm, respectively, while participants wore light indoor clothes without </p>

<p>shoes. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the ratio of weight in </p>

<p>kilograms to squared height in meters (kg/m 2 ). </p>

<p>This study was based on data from 19,599 adults from the 2010-2012 </p>

<p>KNHANES. We excluded participants younger than 40 years, those </p>

<p>who did not have data regarding socioeconomic variables such as </p>

<p>household income, occupation, education, and marital status, and </p>

<p>those who did not have information regarding cancer screening. After </p>

<p>these exclusions, 12,303 participants (5,284 men and 7,019 women) </p>

<p>were included in the final analysis. The Institutional Review Board of </p>

<p>the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved this </p>

<p>study. </p>

<p>2. Definition of Socioeconomic Variables, Health Check-up, 
and Cancer Screening </p>

<p>Information on SES and health-related behaviors was obtained from </p>

<p>the self-reported questionnaire answers during the interview for the </p>

<p>relevant survey period. Participants answered an open-ended ques-</p>

<p>tionnaire, "What is your average monthly household income including </p>

<p>salaries, property income, pension, government subsidies, and allow-</p>

<p>ance?" The ministry of health and welfare classified individuals into </p>

<p>four groups (lowest, middle-lowest, middle-highest, and highest) ac-</p>

<p>cording to monthly household income. Occupational status was cate-</p>

<p>gorized into three groups: manual workers (clerk, service and sales </p>

<p>workers, skilled agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers, persons </p>

<p>who operate or assemble craft, equipment, or machines, and elemen-</p>

<p>tary workers), office workers (general managers, government adminis-</p>

<p>trators, professionals, and simple office worker), and others (unem-</p>

<p>ployed persons, housekeepers, and students). Educational status was </p>

<p>classified according to duration into less than 6 years, 6-&lt;9 years, </p>

<p>9-&lt;12 years, and ≥12 years. </p>

<p>Participants answered the following question about cancer screen-</p>

<p>ing, "Have you undergone cancer screening within the last two years?" </p>

<p>The participants who answered "yes" were further questioned about </p>

<p>the type of cancer screening. Cancer screening was re-categorized into </p>

<p>private cancer screening or NCSP. Private cancer screening included </p>

<p>cancer screening paid for by examinees at healthcare units including </p>

<p>private general hospitals, health check-up centers, and public health-</p>

<p>care center under the Korean National Health Insurance Corporation. </p>

<p>NCSP was defined as cancer screening that was performed without </p>

<p>payment by the examinee and the entire cost was covered by National </p>

<p>Health Insurance. </p>

<p>www.kjfm.or.kr </p>



<p>Individuals who engaged in vigorous-intensity physical activity at </p>

<p>least three days per week or moderate-intensity physical activity in-</p>

<p>cluding walking at least five days per week were defined as the regular </p>

<p>exercise group. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) </p>

<p>was used to assess alcohol-drinking status. Individuals who smoked </p>

<p>cigarettes during the relevant survey period were categorized as cur-</p>

<p>rent smokers. Daily calorie intake was monitored via 24-hour food re-</p>

<p>call and analyzed using <rs id="software-3" type="software">CAN-Pro</rs> ver. <rs corresp="#software-3" type="version-number">3.0</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-3" type="creator">Korean Nutrition Society, Seoul, Korea</rs>). Marital status was classified into three groups: </p>

<p>married and not separated, those who had married and lived with </p>

<p>their spouse; single, those who were not married, those who were </p>

<p>married but separated, widows/widowers, and divorcees; and non-re-</p>

<p>sponders, those who did not respond. </p>

<p>3. Statistical Analysis </p>

<p>To represent the general Korean population with minimal bias, sam-</p>

<p>pling weights were applied to account for complex sampling. All data </p>

<p>from continuous variables such as age, BMI, daily calorie intake, </p>

<p>household income, and AUDIT are presented as the mean and stan-</p>

<p>dard errors (SEs), which were calculated using a complex samples </p>

<p>plan for descriptive analysis. Data from categorical variables such as </p>

<p>smoking status, physical activity, SES (income, occupational, and edu-</p>

<p>cational status), marital status, and cancer screening are presented as </p>

<p>the percentage and SEs. Chi-square tests were used to compare per-</p>

<p>centages for cancer screening within two years according to SES. The </p>

<p>odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for cancer </p>

<p>screening participation within two years were calculated using weight-</p>

<p>ed multivariate logistic regression analyses after adjustment for age, </p>

<p>each SES, and other covariates. <rs id="software-1" type="software">SAS statistical software</rs> ver. <rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">9.4</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="creator">SAS In-stitute Inc., Cary, NC, USA)</rs>) was used to conduct statistical analyses. All </p>

<p>statistical tests were two-tailed and P-value &lt;0.05 was considered to be </p>

<p>statistically significant. </p>

<p>RESULTS </p>

<p>The characteristics of the study participants are summarized in Table </p>

<p>1. The mean age was 54.8 years for men and 56.6 years for women. The </p>

<p>participation rate for overall, private cancer screening, and NCSP </p>

<p>within 2 years was 56.6%, 30.5%, and 27.0%, respectively, in men and </p>

<p>66.0%, 39.3%, and 30.3%, respectively, in women. </p>

<p>Figures 1-3 show the percentage of participants who underwent </p>

<p>cancer screening within two years, according to SES. The highest in-</p>

<p>come groups showed the highest percentage of overall cancer screen-</p>

<p>ing in both sexes (63.8% in men and 74.0% in women). Also, the high </p>

<p>income groups underwent the highest percentage of private cancer </p>

<p>screening in both sexes (39.2% in men and 52.7% in women) and the </p>

<p>lowest rate of NCSP (24.3% in men and 23.8% in women) (Figure 1). </p>

<p>Office workers underwent overall and private cancer screening at the </p>

<p>highest frequency for men and women (61.4% and 73.3% of overall </p>

<p>cancer screening, 37.2% and 45.2% of private cancer screening) (Figure </p>

<p>2). Also, the most educated group had the highest participation rate for </p>

<p>women for overall cancer screening, 36.9% in men and 48.0% in wom-</p>

<p>en for private cancer screening) (Figure 3). </p>

<p>In Table 2, we show the results of multivariate logistic regression for </p>

<p>overall cancer screening after adjusting for age, BMI, daily calorie in-</p>

<p>take, smoking status, AUDIT score, physical activity, and marital status </p>

<p>in addition to each SES including household income, occupational, </p>

<p>and educational status. Compared to the lowest household income </p>

<p>group, ORs (95% CIs) for overall cancer screening of the highest house-</p>

<p>hold income group were 2.113 (1.606-2.781) in men and 1.476 (1.157-</p>

<p>1.883) in women. Compared to manual workers, ORs (95% CIs) of of-</p>

<p>fice workers were not significant for either sex (1.248 [0.982-1.586] in </p>

<p>men and 1.041 [0.750-1.447] in women); ORs (95% CIs) of more edu-</p>

<p>cated groups were also not statistically significant. </p>

<p>In order to further investigate the association between SES and can-</p>

<p>cer screening type, logistic regression analyses were performed after </p>

<p>stratifying private cancer screening and NCSP in Table 3. Compared to </p>

<p>the lowest income group, ORs for private cancer screening of the high-</p>

<p>est income group were statistically higher (2.446 [1.800-3.324] in men </p>

<p>and 2.630 [2.050-3.373] in women), while those for NCSP of women in </p>

<p>the higher household income group were lower (0.735 [0.592-0.911] in </p>

<p>middle-lowest group, 0.619 [0.491-0.781] in middle-highest group, and </p>

<p>0.492 [0.388-0.623] in the highest group). Compared to manual work-</p>

<p>ers, ORs (95% CIs) for private cancer screening of office workers were </p>

<p>1.300 (1.018-1.660) in men and 0.822 (0.616-1.098) in women, while </p>

<p>those for NCSP were not significant. Like occupational status, ORs for </p>

<p>private cancer screening were statistically significant in the most edu-</p>

<p>cated men (1.530 [1.117-2.095]), while ORs for NCSP did not vary be-</p>

<p>tween sexes. </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>The major findings in this study are that both males and females with </p>

<p>higher household income appear to be more likely to undergo cancer </p>

<p>screening from a nationally representative sample, after controlling for </p>

<p>Cancer is the leading cause of death in Korea. Cancer mortality can </p>

<p>be reduced if we detect and treat pre-cancerous lesions and cancer at </p>

<p>an early stage through awareness and a cancer screening system. Can-</p>

<p>cer screening programs aim to identify abnormalities suggestive of </p>

<p>pre-cancerous lesions and to determine the type of cancer in order to </p>

<p>promptly manage the disease. A screening program is an effective </p>

<p>method for diagnosis and early intervention of frequent cancers for </p>

<p>which cost-effective and acceptable screening tests and treatments are </p>

<p>available to high-risk populations. Cancer is the most burdensome </p>

<p>disease in Korea. 7,8) In order to reduce the burden of cancer, NCSP pro-</p>

<p>vide free cancer screening of the stomach for all individuals aged over </p>

<p>40 years, the liver for individuals with hepatitis B or C virus or liver cir-</p>

<p>rhosis, the colorectum for individuals aged 50 years, the breast for </p>

<p>women aged over 40 years, and the uterine cervix for women aged </p>

<p>over 30 years. Screening methods are follows: stomach, gastric endos-</p>

<p>copy or upper gastro-intestinal series, biennially; liver, ultrasound and </p>

<p>serum alpha-fetoprotein, annually; colorectum, fecal occult blood test, </p>

<p>annually; breast, mammography with palpation, biennially; and uter-</p>

<p>ine cervix, pap smear test, biennially. 9,10) In the private sector, individu-</p>

<p>als pay to undergo cancer screenings or health check-up. Many com-</p>

<p>panies will pay the hospital fee for employees to undergo these wel-</p>

<p>fare-type check-ups. As a result of these efforts in the public and pri-</p>

<p>vate sectors, five-year relative cancer survival rates have steadily in-</p>

<p>creased from 41.2% in 1993-1995 to 66.3% in 2007-2011 based on the </p>

<p>period of diagnosis. 1) </p>

<p>SES may influence an individual's health behavior and hospital use </p>

<p>pattern in various ways. Factors known to contribute to socioeconomic </p>

<p>inequality are closely related to different exposure to underlying risk </p>

<p>factors such as smoking, access to screening programs, and diagnosis </p>

<p>and treatment of cancers in a timely manner. 11) In addition, individuals </p>

<p>with lower SES have economic barriers, informational disparity, and </p>

<p>weak support from their company to access health care. 12) Hastert et </p>

<p>al. 3) reported that living in a lower SES area was related to a higher inci-</p>

<p>dence of lung and colorectal cancer and total cancer mortality. Dispar-</p>

<p>ities in cancer screening for breast and uterine cervix in low SES also </p>

<p>exist in Korea, based on the Korea National Cancer Screening Survey. 13) </p>

<p>Several Korean studies have revealed that socioeconomically deprived </p>

<p>populations are associated with worse mortality outcomes for gastric </p>

<p>cancer and female cancers such as breast, uterine, cervix, and ova-</p>

<p>ry. 4,5,14) The percentage of potential cancer deaths that could be avoided </p>

<p>by elimination of educational and racial disparities in the US is over </p>

<p>30%. 11) Proper and timely distribution of limited health resources and </p>

<p>better opportunities for free check-ups can improve health indicators. </p>

<p>A Korean qualitative study indicated that barriers to participation in </p>

<p>cancer screening include lack of trust in NCSP and cancer screening </p>

<p>units, knowledge regarding cancer screening necessity, and awareness </p>

<p>of NCSP. 6) In this study, odds for overall cancer screening were statisti-</p>

<p>cally significant for household income status, but not occupational and </p>

<p>educational status. However, after stratifying cancer screening into pri-</p>

<p>vate and NCSP, ORs for private cancer screening according to house-</p>

<p>hold income status tended to increase in both sexes and occupational </p>

<p>and educational status in men showed statistical significance. Even the </p>

<p>odds for NCSP with household income status in women showed a </p>

<p>downward tendency. The above-mentioned barriers appear to con-</p>

<p>tribute to the current study's findings. Limited healthcare resources </p>

<p>should be efficiently and effectively distributed to the populations that </p>

<p>absolutely require these medical services. Health authorities should </p>

<p>do their best to develop policies to overcome these barriers, increase </p>

<p>awareness of and trust in NSCP, control screening unit quality, and in-</p>

<p>form the population about cancer screening necessity. Providing infor-</p>

<p>mation on cancer screening to the public, especially individuals with </p>

<p>low SES, can increase early detection of cancer, improve treatment </p>

<p>outcomes, promote national health, and reduce social cost. As a virtu-</p>

<p>ous circle, reduced cost should promote national health and welfare. </p>

<p>This study has several limitations that should be considered when </p>

<p>interpreting the findings. First, it was difficult to confirm whether so-</p>

<p>cioeconomic deprivation was a risk factors related to low cancer </p>

<p>screening because of the cross-sectional design of the study. Although </p>

<p>several previous studies have demonstrated that low SES is associated </p>

<p>with low cancer screening participation, advanced cancer detection </p>

<p>by delayed screening can cause economic and occupational depriva-</p>

<p>tion. However, in contrast to economic and occupational status, edu-</p>

<p>cation is rarely affected by previous cancer diagnosis except in terms of </p>

<p>childhood cancer. The causality between SES and cancer screening </p>

<p>does not matter because authorities should be concerned about all </p>

<p>vulnerable social groups. Second, we could not fully exclude the effect </p>

<p>of information bias because the data used in this study were based on </p>

<p>results from self-reported questionnaires. For the reason that self-re-</p>

<p>ported surveys regarding anticipated answers sorted to socially unde-</p>

<p>sirable groups tend to be underestimated, individuals that actually </p>

<p>should have been classified as lower SES might have been classified as </p>

<p>higher SES. Third, cancer type, screening units and methods could not </p>

<p>be identified and differentiated. Some participants were confused </p>

<p>about the type of cancer screening they underwent. </p>

<p>In spite of these potential limitations, this study has several </p>

<p>strengths. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report </p>

<p>the associations between SES and overall cancer screening within two </p>

<p>years. First, we applied sampling weights to all analyses to retain repre-</p>

<p>sentativeness to the entire Korean population. Second, cancer screen-</p>

<p>ing was reclassified into private cancer screening and NCSP according </p>

<p>to payment methods. Although previous studies have reported the re-</p>

<p>lationship of SES to screening for individual cancer types such as </p>

<p>stomach, breast and cervix cancer, 13,15-17) they have not integrated any </p>

<p>cancer screening nor stratified cancer screening into private cancer </p>

<p>screening or NCSP. We included integrated cancer screening, not type-</p>

<p>based cancer screening. Third, screening participation data were lim-</p>

<p>ited to the last two years in order to investigate whether SES is associ-</p>

<p>ated with recent cancer screening. </p>

<p>In conclusion, higher economic status is associated with a higher par-</p>

<p>ticipation rate in overall and private cancer screening in both sexes and </p>

<p>a lower participation rate in NCSP in women. Male office workers and </p>

<p>more educated individuals undergo private cancer screening at a higher </p>

<p>rate than manual workers and less educated individuals, respectively. </p>

<p>thalassemia: a quasi-experimental study. Thalassemia is the most common hereditary 
hemoglobinopathy worldwide. 1 It is more 
common in the Mediterranean, north African, 
as well as east and west Asian countries such 
as Greece, Italy, Turkey, Thailand, Indonesia, 
Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and 
India. 2 It is also common in our country, Iran; 
however, the prevalence of the disease differs 
in different areas of Iran. Akhavan-Niaki et al., 
reported that the prevalence of thalassemia in 
the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf areas of 
Iran is more than 10% of population while it </p>

<p>ranges from 4% to 8% in other areas of the 
country. 3 
Thalassemia is treated mainly by blood 
transfusion and iron chelation therapy. 4 
Currently, great advances have been made 
on the strategies for managing thalassemia and 
prolonging survival among afflicted patients. 5 
Nonetheless, the signs, symptoms, and 
complications of thalassemia still negatively 
affect patients and their families' physical and 
mental health, 6 quality of life (QOL), and their 
functioning. 7 Previous studies have shown that 
patients with thalassemia have significantly 
poorer QOL compared with healthy people. 8-12 </p>

<p>Rafii et al. </p>

<p>224 | Journal of Caring Sciences, September 2016; 5 (3), 223-229 </p>

<p>Given the better life expectancy of patients 
with thalassemia due to the aforementioned 
advances, the challenging issues of managing 
long-term complications of the disease and 
improving afflicted patients' QOL have been </p>

<p>raised. 13 Str√∂mberg argued that patients with </p>

<p>thalassemia need to learn self-care skills for 
improving their own QOL. 14 Moreover, studies 
have shown that patients with thalassemia are 
eager to receive self-care information and 
educations. 
Providing 
high-quality 
information to patients regarding their 
problems and treatments could enhance their 
awareness of treatment goals, improve their 
compliance with treatments, increase the 
effectiveness of intervention, 15 and enhance 
their self-management and QOL. 16 
Given the complexities of the prevention 
and treatment of Beta-thalassemia, and due to 
the increased longevity of these patients we 
should try to offer some effective ways to 
improve the quality of life of these patients. 
Due to the major developments in science 
and technology and the development of 
nursing science as well, the need for extensive 
research to improve the quality of nursing 
care. 
Nurses compared with other medical 
professionals have more time for becoming 
familiar with patient and his problems in term 
of problems that affects the quality of life of 
patients with thalassemia. The aim of this 
study was to examine the effects of a nurse-
implemented orientation program on QOL 
among patients with thalassemia. </p>

<p>Materials and methods </p>

<p>This quasi-experimental study was conducted 
in 2013-2014. The study population comprised 
all patients with thalassemia major who 
referred to Hajar Hospital, Shahrekord, Iran, 
for receiving blood transfusion. The sample 
size was calculated by using the findings of the 
past study conducted by Alijany-Renany. 17 
Subsequently, with a confidence interval of 
95% and a power of 0.80, the results of the 
sample size calculation formula showed that 
eighteen patients were needed for each study </p>

<p>group. However, for having sound statistical 
analyses and considering the attrition rate, we 
recruited 30 patients for each group. The study 
sample was drawn by using the convenience 
sampling method. Patients were included if 
they were desired for participation in the 
study, had an age of sixteen years or older, had 
no healthcare professional among their family 
members, were able to read and write Persian, 
and had no severe hearing or visual problems 
affecting their orientation to place, time, and 
person. The exclusion criteria were developing 
infectious diseases or severe physical 
complications. Patients were randomly 
allocated to either the intervention or the 
control groups by using a table of random 
numbers. Three patients from the intervention 
group voluntarily withdrew from the study 
and two patients from the same group left the 
study due to changing their residence. 
We collected data by using three 
questionnaires including: a) demographic 
questionnaire, b) Thalassemia Quality of Life 
Questionnaire (TQOLQ), and c) the 36-item 
Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). The 
demographic questionnaire consisted of 
patients' personal characteristics and clinical 
data. The TQOLQ was developed by Allahyari 
et 
al., 
based 
on 
the 
Idiopathic 
Thrombocytopenic Purpura Quality of Life 
Questionnaire. It contains eight items for 
investigating QOL among patients with 
thalassemia and had 0-6 Likert-type responses 
for scoring each items of the TQOLQ. Lower 
scores reflect higher QOL. The validity of the 
TQOLQ has been confirmed by assessing its 
content validity; Cronbach's alpha of the 
questionnaire was 0.84 based on a previous 
study. 18 We also used the SF-36 for evaluating 
patients' general QOL. This questionnaire is 
used for assessing health-related QOL and it 
consists of 36 items in eight domains of 
physical functioning, social role functioning, 
physical role functioning, emotional role 
functioning, mental health, vitality, bodily 
pain, and general health perceptions. These 36 
items are scored on 0-100 scale-the higher the 
score, the better the QOL. 19 Previous studies 
have reported that the Persian SF-36 is a </p>

<p>Effects of orientation program on quality of life </p>

<p>Journal of Caring Sciences, September 2016; 5 (3), 223-229 |225 </p>

<p>reliable instrument for assessing QOL. 
Montazeri et al., translated the SF-36 into 
Persian and reported Cronbach's alpha values 
of 0.65-0.90 for it. 20 
Primarily, we invited the study samples to 
complete the demographic questionnaire, the 
TQOLQ, and the SF-36. Patients in the 
intervention group attended an orientation 
program which included the three steps of 
inauguration, implementation, and closure. In 
order to enhance the effectiveness of the 
orientation program, we divided patients in 
the intervention group into three sub-groups 
and oriented each group independently. 
During the inauguration step, participants 
and researchers got familiar with each other 
and the goals of nurse-patient relationship (i.e. 
fulfilling patients' needs, improving their 
health, enhancing their personal autonomy, 
and minimizing complications) were explained 
to the samples. Moreover, patients' potential 
and actual problems in areas such as health 
behaviors, dietary and treatment regimens, 
and mental health were identified through 
performing an assessment of patients and 
taking their medical history. A checklist was 
used for assessments and recording the 
medical history. Two weeks after the 
inauguration step, we took the implementation 
step. In this step, patients received educations 
in three sessions with 60-90-minute. The 
contents of these three sessions were 
respectively as follows, 
1. Explanation of the thalassemia disease and 
its new treatments; 
2. Explanation 
of 
concepts 
such 
as 
hemosiderosis and splenectomy as well as 
strategies for preventing of infection and 
activity-related fatigue; 
3. Explanation of dietary and treatment 
regimens as well as strategies for coping with 
psychological problems. 
All educations were provided by using the 
lecture and the question-and-answer methods. 
At the beginning of the second and the third 
sessions, we asked questions about the 
materials presented in the preceding session(s) 
and reviewed them. Moreover, patients' 
questions were answered at the end of each </p>

<p>session and they were provided with a written 
pamphlet containing a summary of the 
presented materials. At the end of the last 
session, we provided a comprehensive booklet 
to the patients which contained all contents of 
our educations. In the final closure step which 
was taken two weeks after the second step, we 
overviewed 
educations, 
acknowledged 
patients' participation in the study, and 
introduced useful educational websites, books, 
and articles for obtaining complementary 
information 
regarding 
thalassemia. 
In 
addition, we re-assessed patients' educational 
needs by using a self-administered checklist. 
Unfulfilled needs were identified and 
patients with unfulfilled needs were re-
educated individually. One month after the 
closure step, patients were invited to re-
complete the questionnaires. 
Data were analyzed by performing the Chi-
square, and the paired and independent 
samples t-tests by using the <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> Ver. <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">13</rs> 
software. 
This study was approved by ethical 
committee of Tarbiat Modares University, 
Tehran, Iran (No: 52.5367). All participants had 
right to voluntarily participate in the study or 
withdraw from it. Moreover, they were 
informed that their information will remain 
confidential. Written informed consent was 
obtained from all samples. At the end of the 
study, patients in the control group were also 
received all contents of educations .Limitation 
of this study was the short time intervention. 
Further studies are suggested to be conducted 
in this patients of longer time at younger ages. </p>

<p>Results </p>

<p>Demographic data of participants are shown in 
table 1. The results showed that both groups 
were comparable in term of demographic 
characteristics. Since the results of the 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test revealed that all 
study variables had a normal distribution, we 
used parametric statistical tests for analyzing 
the data. Accordingly, the independent-
samples t-test showed that the study groups 
did not significantly differ from each other </p>

<p>regarding the aforementioned variables 
(P&gt;0.05. Moreover, the Chi-square test 
revealed that there were no significant 
differences between the two groups in terms of 
the education and the employment status of </p>

<p>TQOLQ and SF-36 scores are shown in 
tables 2 and 3. The results of the independent-
samples t-test showed that neither before nor 
after the study the control and the intervention 
groups were significantly different from each 
other concerning the scores of TQOLQ and SF-

<p>Discussion </p>

<p>The findings revealed that the mean scores 
of all domains of SF-36 of participnts were </p>

<p>less than 85. Zarea et al., reported the 
similar finding. 21 QOL in patients with 
thalassemia is negatively affected by many 
factors such physical, socioeconomic, and </p>

<p>Effects of orientation program on quality of life </p>

<p>Journal of Caring Sciences, September 2016; 5 (3), 223-229 |227 </p>

<p>psychological states of patients and their 
families. 22 Hadi et al., 11 Clarke et al., 23 and 
Torcharus and Pankaew 24 also reported the 
significant negative effects of thalassemia 
on different aspects of patients' QOL. 
We also found that in both the control 
and the intervention groups, the highest 
score of QOL was related to the physical 
functioning domain. Gollo et al., also 
reported a score of 86.1 for the physical 
functioning domain which was higher than 
the scores of other domains of SF-36. 10 On 
the other hand, the lowest score was related 
to the emotional role functioning domain. 
Hadi et al., also reported that among the 
domains of the SF-36, thalassemia patients' 
emotional role functioning score (67.86) was 
the lowest one. 11 These findings can be 
attributed to the fact that thalassemia care 
in Iran mainly focuses on managing 
patients' physical problems rather than 
other aspects such as psychological 
problems. Consequently, patients usually 
feel higher QOL in the physical functioning 
domain. However, despite considerable 
negative effects of thalassemia on patients 
and their families' emotional and 
psychological health, they are usually 
neither assessed nor cared for their 
emotional or psychological problems. These 
findings highlighted the necessity for 
providing consultation and psychological 
care services to these patients. 
Study findings also revealed that the 
intervention had no significant effect on 
patients' QOL. The mean age of patients 
was greater than 20 years. Most of the 
complications of thalassemia start to 
develop at the earlier ages of life, as early as 
the age of six months; hence, at older ages, 
patients with thalassemia are usually 
suffering from severe effects of both 
thalassemia 
and 
its 
associated 
complications. This could be the reason 
behind the ineffectiveness of our short-term 
intervention in improving patients' QOL. 
Moreover, chronic conditions, such as 
thalassemia, and their complications and 
problems negatively affect different aspects </p>

<p>of patients' lives. For instance, the chronic 
condition of thalassemia damages patients' 
body image and requires them to change 
their lifestyles. 25 Naderi et al., found that 
50.8% of 15-24 years-old patients 
participating in their study suffered from 
psychological problems such as depression, 
anxiety, and social role dysfunction and 
hence, were greatly at risk for developing 
mental disorders. 26 Tabarsi et al., also 
reported that patients with thalassemia 
have different psychosocial and economic 
problems which impair their QOL. 
Accordingly, these problems include 
fatigue, despair, low self-confidence, 
public's negative reactions to thalassemia, 
limited access to physicians of different 
specialties, lack of knowledge related to 
thalassemia, 
scarcity 
of 
required 
medications and equipments, low-quality 
financial and family supports, and families' 
inability to provide the required services. 27 
All these factors might also have 
contributed to the ineffectiveness of our 
intervention. Accordingly, more long-term 
strategies which are implemented from the 
early ages of patients' lives are needed for 
generating significant results. </p>

<p>Conclusion </p>

<p>Thalassemia negatively affects all aspects of </p>

<p>patients' QOL and faces them with different 
physical and psychosocial problems. 
Patients with thalassemia need different 
types of physical and particularly 
psychological and emotional care. Given the 
chronic nature of the disease and the 
severity of associated complications, a 
short-term orientation program, like our 
intervention, would be insufficient for 
improving patients' QOL. Accordingly, 
thalassemia care services should be 
provided over a long period of time for 
achieving significant outcomes. It seems 
that the results of this research will help to 
engage patients in the care and treatment 
effectiveness. </p>

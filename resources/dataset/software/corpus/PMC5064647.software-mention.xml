<p>Mesenchymal stem cells are known to exert immunomodulatory effects in inflammatory 
diseases. Immuneregulatory cells lead to progressive joint destruction in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). Proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and 
interleukins (ILs) are the main players. Here, we studied progenitor cells from RA cartilage 
(RA-CPCs) that are positive for IL-17 receptors to determinate the effects of inflammation 
on their chondrogenic potenial. IL-17A/F reduced the chondrogenic potential of these 
cells via the upregulation of RUNX2 protein and enhanced IL-6 protein and MMP3 mRNA 
levels. Blocking antibodies against IL-17 positively influenced their repair potential. Fur-
thermore, treating the RA-CPCs with the anti-human IL-17 antibody secukinumab or 
the anti-TNF-α antibody adalimumab reduced the proinflammatory IL-6 protein level 
and positively influenced the secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-10 protein. Additionally, 
adalimumab and secukinumab in particular reduced RUNX2 protein to promote chon-
drogenesis. The amelioration of inflammation, particularly via IL-17 antagonism, might 
be a new therapeutic approach for enhancing intrinsic cartilage repair mechanisms in RA 
patients. </p>

<p>Background.-Cluster headache (CH) is a severe neurovascular disorder and an increasing amount of evidence points 
to a genetic contribution to this disease. When CH was first described, it was observed that alcohol may precipitate an 
attack during the active phase of the disease. The alcohol dehydrogenase 4 (ADH4) gene encodes an enzyme which con-
tributes to the metabolization of alcohol and is, therefore, an interesting candidate gene for CH. Two Italian groups have 
reported association of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1126671 located in the ADH4 gene with an increased 
risk of CH in Italy. In addition, one of the groups found an association between the ADH4 SNP rs1800759 and CH. 
Objective.-To perform a replication study on the ADH4 SNPs rs1126671 and rs1800759 in a large homogeneous 
Swedish case-control cohort in order to further investigate the possible contribution of ADH4 to CH. 
Methods.-A total of 390 unrelated patients diagnosed with CH and 389 controls representing a general Swedish pop-
ulation were recruited to the study. DNA samples from patients and controls were genotyped for the two ADH4 SNPs 
rs1126671 and rs1800759 using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Statistical analyses of genotype, allele and 
haplotype frequencies for the two SNPs were performed and compared between patients and controls. 
Results.-For rs1126671, the minor allele frequency (A allele) was 32.8% (n 5 254) in controls compared with 31.9% 
(n 5 249) in CH patients. The minor allele frequency (A allele) of rs1800759 was 42.3% (n 5 324) in controls and 41.9% 
(n 5 327) in CH patients. Statistical analysis showed no significant differences in allele as well as in genotype or haplotype 
frequencies between the patient and control group for either SNP. This was also seen after stratifying the patient group for 
experiencing alcohol as a trigger factor. 
Conclusions.-The data did not support an association of the ADH4 SNPs rs1126671 and rs1800759 with CH. A com-
parison with previous studies revealed variance in genotype, allele, and haplotype frequencies among the different popula-
tions which might contribute to the contradictory results. Although a significant association with CH in Swedish case-
control group was not found, ADH4 as a candidate gene for CH could not be excluded. </p>

<p>lence of up to 0.1%,

<p>common in men than in women. 
1 An increasing </p>

<p>number of studies show a genetic contribution to 
CH, and 7%-20% of the patients have a positive 
family history, defined as having at least one first-, 
second-, or third-degree relative also diagnosed with 
CH. 
3,4 The causes of CH and those factors that might </p>

<p>trigger the onset of an active period are still 
unknown. However, already in 1941 Bayard Horton 
observed that alcohol may elicit an attack in CH 
patients during the active phase. 
5 More recently, it </p>

<p>has been reported that 52%-79% of the patients 
experience alcohol to trigger an attack when in a 
bout. 
6-9 However, the study reporting a frequency of </p>

<p>79% included only male patients with episodic CH. </p>

<p>6 </p>

<p>Among others, this observation has led to investiga-
tions on genes for CH susceptibility which are 
involved in alcohol metabolism. One family of 
enzymes with a primary role in the breakdown of 
alcohol is the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) family. 
They are predominantly expressed in the liver as 
well as gastrointestinal tract, 
10,11 and catalyze the </p>

<p>oxidation of alcohols, such as ethanol or retinol. 
There are several subunits of ADH encoded by dif-
ferent genes. Specifically ADH4, which is located on 
chromosome 4q22-23, has been implicated in a num-
ber of diseases and traits, for instance, Parkinson's 
disease, 
12 alcohol and drug dependence, 
13,14 person-</p>

<p>ality traits such as extraversion and agreeableness, </p>

<p>15 </p>

<p>and moreover it has been associated with CH. </p>

<p>16,17 </p>

<p>The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
rs1126671 located in exon 7 of the ADH4 gene was 
associated with an increased risk for CH in two Ital-</p>

<p>ian studies, whereas rs1800759 located in the pro-
moter region of ADH4 could only be associated with 
CH in the smaller case-control study. 
17 The </p>

<p>rs1126671 SNP induces an amino acid change from 
isoleucine to valine in the corresponding protein. It 
is hypothesized that this amino acid change could 
produce altered enzyme functionality by possibly 
interfering with an adjoining phosphorylation site. </p>

<p>16 </p>

<p>For the ADH4 SNP rs1800759, it has been demon-
strated that promoter activity in hepatoma cells is 
drastically increased in the mutant allele and could 
therefore alter ADH4 p-subunit expression. 
18 In </p>

<p>expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis 
using the Gtex Portal (http://www.gtexportal.org/ 
home/), both rs1126671 and rs1800759 have been 
found to have a significant correlation to the tran-
script levels of ADH4. In esophagus muscularis tis-
sue, the risk alleles (A for both SNPs) were 
associated with higher ADH4 expression levels, 
while in fibroblast cells the risk alleles were associ-
ated with lower ADH4 expression levels (data sour-
ces GTEx Analysis Release V6; dbGaP Accession 
phs000424.v6.p1). 
In other genetic association studies, opposing 
results have pointed to the presence of geographical 
and ethnical differences that underline the impor-
tance of validating findings in independent, homoge-
neous cohorts. Thus, we performed a replication 
study on the ADH4 SNPs rs1126671 and rs1800759 
in a large, Swedish case-control cohort in order to 
further investigate the possible contribution of 
ADH4 to CH. </p>

<p>MATERIAL AND METHODS 
The study cohort consisted of 390 CH patients 
and 389 controls (Table 1). The study material was 
obtained after approval of the local ethics committee 
in Stockholm and informed consent of both patients 
and controls. CH patients were recruited from the 
neurology clinic at the Karolinska University Hospital, 
Stockholm, Sweden. The diagnosis of CH was based 
on the International Classification of Headache Disor-
ders (ICHD-III) criteria.

<p>(n 5 379) were anonymous healthy blood donors from 
the Stockholm area recruited when donating blood at 
the Karolinska University Hospital. This group </p>

no demographic information available except for gen-
der. Ten additional controls were neurologically 
healthy individuals recruited when visiting the neurol-
ogy clinic at the Karolinska University Hospital. Blood 
samples were collected from CH patients during 2000 
and 2014-2015 and from control individuals during 
2005 and 2015. DNA was extracted using standard 
protocols. The majority of patients (n 5 349) as well as 
10 neurologically healthy controls completed a ques-
tionnaire regarding clinical data, medication, and life-
style. Genotyping was performed by TaqManV R 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (7500

<p>The data on the two ADH4 SNPs for all 779 individu-
als were exclusively collected for this replication study.

ation was tested for via logistic regression with sex

<p>in the proportions of subgroups of the patient 
cohort regarding alcohol as a trigger factor was 
tested for by using a two-tailed two-proportion Z-

cance level 0.05. Haplotype analysis was performed 
in HaploView v.4.2. 
20 For power analysis, the </p>

<p>With our sample size and a minor allele frequency 
of 0.33 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/), 
we are able to detect true odds ratios (OR) for CH 
below 0.64 or above 1.51, respectively. The 
observed frequencies of controls were in agreement 
with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium which was 
tested for using the web-based <rs type="software">Online Encyclopedia 
for Genetic Epidemiology studies software</rs>. </p>

controls for each SNP did not reveal a significant dif-
ference between the case and control group (Table 
2). Logistic regression with sex as a covariate was 
run in order to exclude any bias introduced by the 
skewed sex ratio in the patient group. We could not 
find a genotypic association with CH for either 
rs1126671 (P 5 .753) or rs1800759 (P 5 .985) when 
applying sex-corrected logistic regression. To take 
into account variability in subgroups of patients, we 
additionally performed a stratified analysis with 
respect to whether the patient regarded alcohol as a 
trigger factor or not (information retrieved from the 
questionnaire). When comparing controls with only 
patients that have reported alcohol to trigger an 
attack (n 5 196; 56.2% of patients who filled out the 
questionnaire), there were no significant differences 
in the genotypes of the two groups for either SNP 
(Table 3). Furthermore, we did the following obser-
vations from the patients who answered the ques-
tionnaire: 58.1% of the male (n 5 236) and 52.2% of 
the female (n 5 113) CH patients reported alcohol as 
a trigger factor. In addition, 55.7% of the episodic 
(n 5 309) and 60.5% of the chronic (n 5 38) CH 
patients experienced alcohol to elicit an attack. 
There were no significant differences in the propor-
tions of male and female, or episodic and chronic, 
patients who reported alcohol as a trigger factor 
(data available upon request). Finally, a haplotype 
analysis was carried out for the two ADH4 polymor-
phisms (Table 4); none of the haplotypes were asso-
ciated with CH. </p>

<p>DISCUSSION 
This is the largest study on ADH4 and CH 
reported so far. Genotypic and allelic analyses of 
the investigated ADH4 polymorphisms rs1126671 
and rs1800759 in CH patients suggest that there is 
no association between these genetic variants and 
CH in Sweden. The power of this study is much 
higher compared with previous studies where an 
association between ADH4 and CH has been 
found. 
16,17 The two previously reported studies </p>

<p>have been carried out on comparably small cohorts 
including only 110 and 54 CH patients, respectively. 
However, it is possible that population differences 
may lead to these varying results. Genotype and 
allele frequencies observed in controls from our 
study roughly correspond to the ones reported in </p>

<p>the two Italian studies. Yet, for rs1800759 the 
mutant allele seems to be less common in the Ital-
ian cohorts (31.0%-33.7%) compared with our 
Swedish cohort (42.3%). From our questionnaire 
data, 56.2% of the patients reported that alcohol 
may trigger an attack which corresponds to what 
other groups have reported (52%-63%). 
7-9 When </p>

<p>performing a statistical analysis for control individ-
uals and CH patients reporting alcohol as a trigger 
factor, there were no significant differences in the 
genotypes of the two groups for either SNP. A 
comparison between the haplotype analysis from 
one of the Italian studies 
16 and our Swedish analy-</p>

<p>sis emphasizes the deviation in haplotype frequen-
cies among these two populations. For example, the 
diplotype A-C, corresponding to the mutated allele 
of rs1126671 and the wild-type allele of rs1800759, 
is very rare in our Swedish material (0.6%), 
whereas in the Italian cohort (27.9%) it is much 
more common. 
In conclusion, our data suggest that the SNPs 
rs1126671 and rs1800759 in the ADH4 gene are not 
genetic risk factors for CH in the Swedish popula-
tion. Although we did not find a significant associa-
tion with CH in our Swedish case-control material, 
we could not exclude ADH4 as a candidate gene 
for CH. More studies on additional ADH4 SNPs as 
well as novel candidate genes will be needed to 
answer the question why and how alcohol may pre-
cipitate attacks during a bout in more than half of 
the patients with CH. </p>

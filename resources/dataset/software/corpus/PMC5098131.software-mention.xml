<p>Human bone marrow contains a population of non-hematopoietic stromal stem/progenitor cells (BMSCs), 
which play a central role for bone marrow stroma and the hematopoietic microenvironment. However, the 
precise characteristics and potential stem cell properties of defined BMSC populations have not yet been 
thoroughly investigated. Using standard adherent colony-forming unit fibroblast (CFU-F) assays, we have 
previously shown that BMSCs were highly enriched in the nonhematopoietic CD271 
pos /CD140a 
low/neg fraction 
of normal adult human bone marrow. In this study, we demonstrate that prospectively isolated CD271 </p>

<p>uman bone marrow contains a population of non-
hematopoietic stromal stem/progenitor cells (BMSCs), 
which are important components of the hematopoietic stem 
cell niche, give rise to the hematopoietic stroma upon trans-
plantation, and possess in vivo multilineage differentiation 
capacities toward skeletal lineages [1-3]. Despite their key 
role in bone marrow physiology, little is known about BMSC 
stem cell characteristics, which is mainly due to the fact that 
primary BMSCs have thus far been elusive for a precise 
phenotypical definition. However, recent progress has led 
to the identification of suitable markers/marker combinations 
to effectively enrich BMSCs [1,2,4-6], and furthermore, 
recently-developed non-adherent mesensphere cultures al-
lowed to assay and amplify potent hematopoiesis-supporting 
BMSCs while preserving their undifferentiated phenotype [7]. 
Using these tools, the current study therefore aimed to 
investigate key phenotypical and, importantly, functional </p>

<p>stem cell properties of prospectively isolated human 
BMSCs. Our results clearly demonstrate for the first time 
that non-hematopoietic CD271 
pos /CD140a 
low/neg cells are 
stromal stem cells with in vivo self-renewal and differenti-
ation potential in a serial transplantation setting. </p>

<p>Bone marrow mononuclear cells </p>

<p>In total, bone marrow samples (60 mL) were aspirated from 
the iliac crest bone of consenting healthy adult donors (n = 41, 
median age 25 years, and range 19-35). The study was ap-
proved by the local ethics committee. Bone marrow mono-
nuclear cells (BM-MNCs) were isolated by density gradient 
centrifugation (Ficoll-Paque Premium; GE Healthcare Life 
Sciences) following incubation with RosetteSep Human 
Mesenchymal Stem Cell Enrichment Cocktail (StemCell 
Technologies) for lineage depletion (CD3, CD14, CD19, 
CD38, CD66b, and glycophorin A). </p>

information on the antibodies used in this study, please see 
Supplementary Materials and Methods; Supplementary Data 
are available online at www.liebertpub.com/scd). Sorting gates 
were set according to the corresponding fluorescence-minus-
one (FMO) controls. Cells were sorted on a fluorescence ac-
tivated cell sorting (FACS)Aria II or a FACSAria III cell sorter 
(BD Biosciences). Dead cells were excluded by 7-amino-
actinomycin (7-AAD; Sigma) staining, and doublets were ex-
cluded by gating on FSC-H versus FSC-W and SSC-H versus 
SSC-W. A description of the flow cytometric analysis is pro-
vided in the Supplementary Materials and Methods. </p>

growth medium as described before [8]. The medium com-
position is described in detail in the Supplementary Materials 
and Methods. To prevent cell aggregation, cultures were left 
untouched for 1 week. Thereafter, half-medium changes were 
performed twice weekly. Spheres were passaged following 
enzymatic digestion with 0.25% type I collagenase (StemCell 
Technologies) for 30 min at 37°C, followed by washing with 
PBS, and replating at clonal density. </p>

<p>Sorted BM-MNCs were cultured in standard MSC culture 
medium [StemMACS MSC Expansion Medium (Miltenyi 
Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach) plus 1% antibiotic-antimycotic 
solution (Sigma)]. Medium was changed weekly and pas-
saged as described [2]. Colony-forming unit fibroblast 
(CFU-F) assays were performed as before [2] and as de-
scribed in the Supplementary Materials and Methods. </p>

<p>In vitro differentiation assays </p>

<p>Stromal cells derived from adherent and sphere cultures 
were differentiated toward the adipogenic, osteogenic, and 
chondrogenic lineages as described [2]. Briefly, for adipogenic 
differentiation, cells were cultured for 14 days in AdipoDiff 
medium (Miltenyi Biotec) and stained with Oil red O (Sigma) </p>

<p>following fixation. For osteogenic differentiation, cells were 
cultured in osteogenesis induction medium (see Supplementary 
Materials and Methods) for 21 days and calcium depositions 
were visualized by alizarin red staining (Sigma). Chondrogenic 
differentiation was induced by culturing cell pellets for 28 days 
in chondrogenesis-induction medium (see Supplementary 
Materials and Methods). Cryosections of fixed pellets were 
stained with goat anti-human aggrecan, and nuclei were stained 
with 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Life Technolo-
gies). Sections were analyzed with an Axiovert 200 M fluo-
rescence microscope equipped with an AxioCam HRm camera 
(both from Carl Zeiss). </p>

To evaluate in vivo self-renewal, implants were removed after 
8 weeks, digested in 0.25% type I collagenase (STEMCELL

To assess the in vivo differentiation capacities, implants

low/neg cells) represented a (close to) 
pure population of stromal progenitor cells [6]. 
As reported, freshly-sorted CD271 </p>

<p>pos </p>

<p>/CD140a 
low/neg cells 
showed typical morphological BMSC features (Fig. 1A) [2,10] 
and expressed a typical ''mesenchymal'' stromal cell (MSC) 
surface marker profile (Fig. 1B) [5,6,11]. Expression of CD56, 
which was reported to identify bone-lining BMSCs [5], was 
limited to a small fraction of the cells (Fig. 1B). Thus, CD56 
might be a possible positive marker for endosteal niche 
BMSCs, complementary to the negative expression of CD146 
that we previously reported for this cell population [2]. Ex-
pression of integrin a6 (CD49f) on cultured MSC has been 
implicated in enhancing stem cell properties [12]. Interest-
ingly, CD49f was clearly expressed in about one third of the </p>

low/neg cells (Fig. 1B), which might indicate 
a possible role of CD49f in maintaining stemness of primary 
BMSCs. Certainly, this is an interesting point that will be 
addressed in future experiments. 
Gene expression profiling of prospectively enriched BMSC 
has been reported for bulk sorted cells [6,13,14], which has 
obvious limitations when aiming to characterize highly-purified 
BMSCs. We therefore investigated the expression of a panel of 
selected BMSC-relevant genes in single-sorted CD271 </p>

low/neg cells (Fig. 1C, D and Supplementary Table S1). 
CD271 </p>

<p>/CD140a 
low/neg cells showed a high and homoge-
neous expression of CXCL12 and ANGPT (Fig. 1D, group I), 
the majority of common MSC-related genes (group II), most of 
the differentiation genes (group III), as well as Wnt signaling 
pathway-related genes (group VI), which are in accordance 
with published data on bulk sorted cells [13,14]. Interestingly, 
IL-7 expression was heterogeneous (group I), which might 
point to a differential function of BMSC subsets in bone mar-
row lymphopoiesis. Furthermore, variances in expression of 
chondrocyte differentiation marker SOX9 (Fig. 1D, group III) 
are likely to reflect differentiation potential differences. Low 
expression levels were observed for NES (group II), SOX10 
(group V), as well as several group IV and VI genes. Finally,

<p>In vivo stem cell functions of CD271 
pos / 
CD140a 
low/neg BMSCs </p>

<p>Previous reports demonstrated in vitro stem/progenitor cell 
properties of human BMSCs [15,16]. However, true stem cell 
properties cannot be assessed in vitro, but only in vivo by 
proving that a putative stem cell can generate cells that are 
functionally equivalent to the original. 
Evidence that primary BMSCs are stem cells comes from 
seminal studies demonstrating that single CFU-F-derived 
clonal cells were capable of generating bone and hemato-
poietic stroma in vivo and that secondary CFU-F could be 
recovered from the transplants [1]. Furthermore, in vivo 
self-renewal of clonogenic cells was demonstrated for fetal 
human and adult murine BMSCs using the mesensphere 
assay [8,17]. However, whether or not adult human BMSCs 
fulfill stringent stem cell criteria in a serial transplantation 
setting has not been thoroughly addressed thus far, although </p>

formed based on the expression of human CD90 and CD105 
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). CD90 and CD105 were chosen as 
sorting markers because of their relative stable expression in 
the transplanted cells in contrast to other markers. The sorting 
strategy and detection approach were validated by qPCR </p>

<p>analysis of human and mouse housekeeping genes (Supple-
mentary Fig. S2B). 
In vivo self-renewal of CD271

was demonstrated by increasing number of spheres after 
primary and secondary transplantation compared with pre-
transplantation values for both bulk-sorted (1.16 -0.06 and

spheres (1.54 -0.28 and 2.51 -0.72-fold, n = 3) (Fig. 3B and 
Supplementary Table S2). In contrast, implantation of ad-
herently cultured CFU-Fs resulted in a more than 100-fold 
reduction of colony numbers after primary transplantation 
(Supplementary Fig. S2C), and therefore, secondary CFU-F 
transplantations were not performed.

invading the implants (Fig. 3C, D, respectively). There is 
cumulating evidence that differentiation potentials differ 
between stromal cells depending on their tissue of origin 
[18-20]. Our current work focused on BMSC and it there-
fore remains to be investigated whether or not stromal cell 
preparations from other sources have similar sphere for-

pectively. The photomicrographs in the upper row left dem-
onstrated generation of bone (b), adipocytes (a), and stromal 
tissues (Hematoxylin eosin staining, HE). Dark brown areas 
represent HA/TCP particles. Immunohistochemical staining 
with anti-human vimentin (upper row, right), anti-human 
mitochondria (lower row, left), and anti-mouse CD45 anti-
bodies (lower row, right) indicates human and murine origin of 
the stromal tissues and hematopoietic cells, respectively. Scale 
bars represent 100 mm for HE and anti-CD45 staining, and 
50 mm for anti-vimentin and anti-mitochondria staining. For 
controls, see Supplementary Figure S2D. </p>

adherent cultures, enhanced stem cell properties and allowed 
to expand transplantable stromal stem cells, which is certainly 
an important finding for future studies aiming to design stroma 
stem cell replacement and repair strategies. </p>

<p>Among the neurological diseases, cerebrovascular diseases are 
the most common in developed countries. Stroke is the most 
common cause of death in these countries, and neoplastic diseases 
(cancer and hematologic tumors) are the second most common 
cause. However, stroke is a rare complication of cancer therapy, and 
does not occur as often as metastasis or neurotoxicity. </p>

<p>1,2   A retrospective autopsy study of a large cohort of cancer pa-
tients performed by Graus et al showed that 15% of cancer patients 
have evidence of cerebrovascular disease, and about half of these 
patients have clinical symptoms of stroke. </p>

<p>3   In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the demographic, 
clinical, and laboratory data of cancer and cancer-free patients that 
presented with acute ischemic stroke in the emergency department. </p>

<p>admitted to our emergency department (ED) with ischemic stroke 
between January 1st, 2011 and July 15th, 2014. Medical history and 
physical examination data were obtained from all patients who 
were diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke. Acute ischemic stroke 
diagnoses were confirmed by further imaging tests of the brain, 
including computed tomography (CT) and diffusion-weighted 
magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI). 
The ischemic stroke patients were divided into two groups: 
group 1; patients with active cancer (Trousseau's) and group 2; 
those without. Active cancer was defined as a confirmed malig-
nancy, which was either treated or untreated in the six months 
before stroke. 
4 Demographic characteristics and clinical data were </p>

<p>collected and evaluated. These two groups were then divided into 
subgroups: those who had had one stroke (groups 1A and 2A) and 
those who had more than one (groups 1B and 2B). Patients who 
were diagnosed with transient ischemia or who had no evidence of 
either acute or chronic infarction after neuroimaging were 
excluded from the study. Patients with primary brain cancer and 
patients who had intracranial metastases were also excluded since 
these patients were thought to have different underlying stroke 
mechanisms. </p>

<p>2.2. Statistical analysis </p>

<p>All data was analyzed using <rs id="software-0" type="software">SPSS</rs> software (version <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">15.0</rs>; <rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">SPSS Inc</rs>., Chicago, IL). The chi-square test was used to compare stroke 
risk factors and subtypes between cancer patients who had expe-
rienced one ischemic stroke and those who had experienced more 
than one. A student's t-test was used to compare biomarkers be-
tween the two groups. P value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. </p>

<p>3. Results </p>

<p>Among the 200 adult patients referred to the ED with stroke, we 
identified 178 patients who were diagnosed as acute ischemic 
stroke. Nine patients with transient ischemia, eight patients with 
primary brain cancer and five patients who had intracranial me-
tastases were excluded from the study. The active cancer group 
(group 1) included 91 patients (60 male, 31 female), and the stroke 
without cancer group (group 2) included 87 (56 male, 31 female). 
The mean age was 65.18 ± 11.98 among those with cancer and 
62.80 ± 12.23 among those without; this difference was not sig-
nificant (p ¼ 0.193). Among the patients with active cancer, 24 had 
previously experienced a stroke whereas in the group without 
cancer, 15 had previously experienced a stroke. The demographic 
and clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1. 
Laboratory tests, including blood urine nitrogen, creatinine, 
aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, hematocrit, D-
dimer, C-reactive protein, hemoglobin, and platelet counts, were 
obtained for all patients, and significant differences were found 
between groups for all parameters (p &lt; 0.05). The patients' labo-
ratory values are shown in Table 2. 
Patients with active cancer were divided into two subgroups 
based on the number of strokes experienced after malignancy 
diagnosis: only one stroke (n ¼ 67; group 1A) or more than one 
(n ¼ 24; group 1B) were. Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were 
significantly greater among patients who had only one stroke: 
hemoglobin, 12.29 ± 1.81 vs. 10.94 ± 2.00 (p ¼ 0.004, Fig. 1) and 
hematocrit, 37.15 ± 5.34 vs. 33.70 ± 6.51 (p ¼ 0.012). Laboratory 
values for the two subgroups are shown in Table 3. 
Among patients without cancer, laboratory values did not differ 
between those who had experienced only one stroke (n ¼ 72; group 
2A) and those who had multiple strokes (n ¼ 15; group 2B) 
(Table 4). </p>

<p>
Among patients with cancer, 21 patients were diagnosed with 
prostate cancer, 14 with lung cancer, 11 with gastric cancer, and 
nine with skin cancer (Table 5). </p>

<p>4. Discussion </p>

<p>Kim et al 
5 reported that d-dimer, pro-BNP, and fibrinogen levels </p>

<p>were higher in ischemic stroke patients with cancer compared to 
those without. Consistent with the literature, 
5 d-dimer levels in the </p>

<p>present study were significantly higher in cancer patients. These 
results imply a relationship between cancer and inflammation, 
thrombus formation, and coagulopathy, which could explain the 
increased frequency of ischemic stroke in cancer patients compared 
with non-cancer patients. </p>

<p>5   Kim et al found that among stroke patients with cancer, 33 
(21.2%) had gastric cancer, 25 (16%) had lung cancer, 22 (14.1%) had 
colon cancer, 20 (12.8%) had hepatobiliary cancer, and 84 (53.8%) had 
metastases. 
4 In the present study, 21 patients were diagnosed with </p>

<p>prostate cancer (23.08%), 14 with lung cancer (15.38%), 11 with 
gastric cancer (12.09%), and 9 with skin cancer (9.89%). 
C-reactive protein is an acute peptide related to inflammation and the 
progression of hemangioendothelioma, and increases during systemic 
inflammation and atherosclerotic disease. 
6 Previous studies showed that </p>

<p>leukocyte count and levels of fibrinogen and C-reactive protein (CRP) may 
serve as markers of inflammatory activity. Inflammatory activity increases 
the risk for vascular events and worsens prognosis after a stroke. 
7e15 In the </p>

<p>present study, CRP levels were 0. 10e27.60 Unit (U) acute ischemic stroke 
patients with malignancy (Trousseau's syndrome), and 0. 10e14.40 U in 
stroke patients with no malignancy, a statistically significant difference 
(p &lt; 0.001). 
Among the hematopoietic growth factors, erythropoiesis-stimulating 
agents (ESAs) are frequently used in oncology due to their ability to cor-
rect chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression and anemia; how-
ever, administration of ESAs to patients with cancer is associated with 
increased risks for venous thromboembolism, higher mortality, 
16, 17 and even </p>

<p>tumor progression. 
18 In the present study, hemoglobin levels were </p>

<p>11.93 ± 1.98 in stroke patients with malignancy (Trousseau's syndrome), and 
13.61 ± 1.92 in stroke patients without, also a significant difference 
(p &lt; 0.001). Thus, in patients with malignancies, stroke is strongly associated 
with anemia. In our study, among the subgroups, hemoglobin levels were 
12.29 ± 1.81 for the patients who had experienced only one stroke, and 
10.94 ± 2.14 for the patients who had experienced multiple strokes, and 
again, these values were significantly different (p ¼ 0.004). This data sug-
gests that there is a strong correlation between increased number of strokes 
and degree of anemia. 
Smoking is a common risk factor in both ischemic stroke and 
cancer, and is also the cause of most ischemic strokes in cancer </p>

<p>patients. 
2,11 Most reports have found that hypertension and </p>

<p>smoking are the most common causes of ischemic stroke in cancer 
patients, 
11e15 and these results correlate well with our findings. In </p>

<p>our study, there was a higher incidence of both smoking and hy-
pertension among Trousseau's patients (n ¼ 64, 70.32%; n ¼ 50, 
54.94%, respectively). </p>

<p>5. Limitations </p>

<p>One limitation of this presented cross-sectional, retrospective 
analysis is that the sample is small and the other is that the study 
design limits the degree of change in anemia which may have led to 
recurrence of ischemic stroke in patients with Trousseau's syn-
drome. This issue in limitation should be considered in case-control 
studies with larger sample size. </p>

<p>6. Conclusions </p>

<p>In this preliminary study, we observed that repeated episodes of 
stroke in patients with Trousseau's syndrome seem to occur more 
frequently in the presence of anemia. Therefore, we suggest that 
restoration of hemoglobin levels may help prevent recurrent stroke 
in patients with Trousseau's syndrome. </p>

<p>INTRODUCTION: Three-dimensional printing technol-
ogy has been used in medicine for anatomical modeling, 
pre-operative planning, prosthetic construction, and most 
recently bioprinting. 1,2 The high purchase cost of 3D print-
ers has previously limited their widespread use, causing 
surgeons to outsource 3D anatomic model manufacturing at 
an average cost of $4,000/print. 3 The development of "desk-
top" 3D printers has decreased printer purchasing costs 
from $45,000 (2001) to under $2,000 (2016), 4 providing 
an opportunity to bypass high-cost third-party manufactur-
ing to create patient-customized 3D models. We provide a 
proof-of-concept demonstration using a desktop 3D printer 
and open-access software to create patient-specific comput-
erized tomography (CT)-based 3D models to guide skeletal 
deformity reconstructions. </p>

<p>METHODS: Four patients (2 syndromic craniosynosto-
sis, 1 cranial defect, 1 distal radius deformity secondary 
to arthrogryposis) were included. CT scans (â‰¤1 mm slices) 
were obtained (DICOM file) for volumetric conversion to 
3D models (STL file) using free open-source software (<rs id="software-4" type="software">3D 
Slicer</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-4" type="url">http://www.slicer.org</rs>). The resulting STL files were 
uploaded to the <rs type="software">MakerBot</rs> desktop application for printing 
with the MakerBot Replicator 2 ($2,750, MakerBot Indus-
tries, Brooklyn, NY). Material cost and printing time were 
recorded for comparison to alternative manufacturing meth-
ods. The 3D models were used to guide pre-operative plan-
ning and intra-operative reconstruction. </p>

<p>RESULTS: CT-to-3D models were successfully printed 
for all patients. Two distinct 3D models were created for 
the cranioplasty case (volumetric skeletal reconstruction 
and topographic representation of the defect). The print-
ing material (polylactic acid) averaged $15/model and its 
unique properties allowed for inexpensive gas sterilization 
for intraoperative use. CT-to-3D model conversion time 
averaged 24-hours/case. All patients underwent successful 
reconstruction without complications. </p>

<p>CASE EXAMPLE: A 23-month old female with a history 
of ruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysm requiring cra-
niotomy, hematoma evacuation, and ventriculoperitoneal </p>

<p>shunt placement with resulting 40 cm 2 parietal cranial 
defect successfully underwent parietal exchange hybrid 
cranioplasty 5 with particulate bone graft and demineralized 
bone matrix. 3D models of her neurocranium with the cra-
nial defect and a topographic representation of the defect 
were created to guide reconstruction. </p>

<p>CONCLUSION: An affordable, user-friendly 3D printer 
provides a practical, cost-effective, and time-efficient 
alternative to traditional outsourcing of 3D anatomic 
model manufacturing. This technology affords recon-
structive surgeons the ability to construct realistic, 
economical 3D models for enhanced pre-operative plan-
ning and intra-operative guidance for complex defect 
reconstruction. </p>

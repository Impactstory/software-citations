<p>METHODS: Four patients (2 syndromic craniosynosto-
sis, 1 cranial defect, 1 distal radius deformity secondary 
to arthrogryposis) were included. CT scans (â‰¤1 mm slices) 
were obtained (DICOM file) for volumetric conversion to 
3D models (STL file) using free open-source software (<rs id="software-4" type="software">3D Slicer</rs>, <rs corresp="#software-4" type="url">http://www.slicer.org</rs>). The resulting STL files were 
uploaded to the <rs type="software">MakerBot</rs> desktop application for printing 
with the MakerBot Replicator 2 ($2,750, MakerBot Indus-
tries, Brooklyn, NY). Material cost and printing time were 
recorded for comparison to alternative manufacturing meth-
ods. The 3D models were used to guide pre-operative plan-
ning and intra-operative reconstruction. </p>

<p>RESULTS: CT-to-3D models were successfully printed 
for all patients. Two distinct 3D models were created for 
the cranioplasty case (volumetric skeletal reconstruction 
and topographic representation of the defect). The print-
ing material (polylactic acid) averaged $15/model and its 
unique properties allowed for inexpensive gas sterilization 
for intraoperative use. CT-to-3D model conversion time 
averaged 24-hours/case. All patients underwent successful 
reconstruction without complications. </p>

<p>CASE EXAMPLE: A 23-month old female with a history 
of ruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysm requiring cra-
niotomy, hematoma evacuation, and ventriculoperitoneal </p>

<p>shunt placement with resulting 40 cm 
2 parietal cranial 
defect successfully underwent parietal exchange hybrid 
cranioplasty 
5 with particulate bone graft and demineralized 
bone matrix. 3D models of her neurocranium with the cra-
nial defect and a topographic representation of the defect 
were created to guide reconstruction. </p>

<p>CONCLUSION: An affordable, user-friendly 3D printer 
provides a practical, cost-effective, and time-efficient 
alternative to traditional outsourcing of 3D anatomic 
model manufacturing. This technology affords recon-
structive surgeons the ability to construct realistic, 
economical 3D models for enhanced pre-operative plan-
ning and intra-operative guidance for complex defect 
reconstruction. </p>

<p>Abstract </p>

<p>The proportion of alcohol-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) in all ONFH patients was 30.7%, with males prevailing 
among the ONFH patients in mainland China (70.1%). Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), a member of the MMP gene family, 
encodes the enzyme MMP2, which can promote osteoclast migration, attachment, and bone matrix degradation. In this 
case-control study, we aimed to investigate the association between MMP2 and the alcohol-induced ONFH in Chinese males. 
In total, 299 patients with alcohol-induced ONFH and 396 healthy controls were recruited for a case-control association study. 
Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the MMP2 locus were genotyped and examined for their correlation with the risk of 
alcohol-induced ONFH and treatment response using Pearson x 
2 test and unconditional logistic regression analysis. We identified 3 
risk alleles for carriers: the allele "T" of rs243849 increased the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH in the allele model, the log-additive 
model without adjustment, and the log-additive model with adjustment for age. Conversely, the genotypes "CC" in rs7201 and "CC" 
in rs243832 decreased the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH, as revealed by the recessive model. After the Bonferroni multiple 
adjustment, no significant association was found. Furthermore, the haplotype analysis showed that the "TT" haplotype of MMP2 was 
more frequent among patients with alcohol-induced ONFH by unconditional logistic regression analysis adjusted for age. 
In conclusion, there may be an association between MMP2 and the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH in North-Chinese males. 
However, studies on larger populations are needed to confirm this hypothesis; these data may provide a theoretical foundation for 
future studies. </p>

<p>Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is an intractable and

and death.

<p>[4]   Two types of ONFH exist: the traumatic and nontraumatic type. 
Alcohol-induced ONFH is a type of nontraumatic ONFH 
caused by chronic and excessive alcohol consumption. The 
incidence of this condition is increasing in China; data show that 
males dominate with a 70.1% in mainland China, and that the 
proportion of alcohol-induced ONFH among all ONFH patients 
is 30.7%. 
[5] One previous study reported that when alcohol 
intake was higher than 400 mL/wk, there was a clear increase in 
the risk of ONFH. 
[6] Several pathogenic mechanisms associated 
with the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH include environmental 
factors, alcohol intake, dyslipidemia, blood coagulation disor-
ders, and ossification dysfunction of mesenchymal stem cells; 
however, the exact pathogenesis of this condition is still 
controversial and unclear. Genetic researches have offered the 
potential insight into the occurrence and development of alcohol-
induced ONFH. Zhang et al 
[7] confirmed the association between 
ABCB1 polymorphism and increased ONFH risk. In addition, 
the association of ONFH with angiogenesis-and hypoxia-related 
gene polymorphisms, such as IGFBP3, VEGFC, and ACE, has 
been confirmed 
[8] . Recent studies suggest that MMP2 may play a </p>

<p>key role in the process of bone metabolism and influence the 
proliferation and/or differentiation of bone marrow stem cells in 
bone and joint diseases. </p>

<p>[9,10]   MMP2 is a member of the MMP gene family, which encodes 
zinc-dependent enzymes capable of cleaving components of the 
extracellular matrix and molecules involved in signal transduc-
tion. The MMP/tissue inhibitor of MMP (MMP/TIMP) pathway 
has also been found to impact human bone metabolism, 
[11] while 
polymorphisms of several genes in the pathway have been related 
to orthopedic diseases. 
[12-14] Some single-nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs) in MMP2 have been associated with several 
diseases: for example, rs1053605 is associated with stroke 
outcome, 
[15] but not with abdominal aortic aneurysm 
[16] ; 
rs243849 is related to ischemic stroke outcome 
[15] ; the 
rs243847 variant may increase intracranial aneurysms in 
Japanese male patients 
[17] ; 2 SNPs, rs243832 and rs7201, that 
have a strong linkage disequilibrium (LD), have been associated 
with endometriosis. 
[18] However, whether these 5 MMP2 SNPs 
are associated with alcohol-induced ONFH is still unknown. 
Therefore, in this case-control study, we aimed to investigate 
whether the genetic aspect of MMP2 had a protective or risk-
increasing nature in the context of alcohol-induced ONFH in 
Chinese males. </p>

<p>2. Methods </p>

<p>2.1. Ethics committee statement </p>

<p>This case-control study was performed in compliance with the 
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki of the World Medical 
Association and obtained the permission from the Ethics 
Committee of Xi'an Hong-Hui Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong 
University, and Northwest University. All of the participants </p>

<p>were informed of the case-control study, and their consents were 
obtained. </p>

<p>2.2. Research subjects </p>

<p>This case-control study was conducted in Xi'an Hong-Hui 
Hospital, and a total of 695 males pathologically confirmed 
alcohol-induced ONFH patients were enrolled from September 
2014 to January 2016, including 299 patients and 396 healthy 
controls. ONFH was diagnosed by clinical examination and 
radiographic analysis. Patients underwent anteroposterior and frog 
view X-ray tests; magnetic resonance imaging was needed to further 
confirm the ONFH in cases when the patients had no changes 
observable by X-ray. According to Lee et al </p>

<p>[19]   , alcohol-induced 
ONFH patients were those who consumed more than 400 mL of 
pure ethanol per week. Some patients were excluded from the study 
for reasons such as disagreeing with the study, consumption of 
drugs that have an effect on the patients' liver function and lipid 
metabolism, not meeting the diagnostic criteria of alcohol-induced 
ONFH, and suffering from chronic diseases synchronously. The 
person needing steroid treatment is also excluded from this 
case-control study. All healthy controls had never been diagnosed 
with alcohol-induced ONFH and were interviewed by professional 
interviewers for their age and alcohol exposure. </p>

<p>2.3. Genotyping </p>

<p>MMPs play a key role in the process of bone metabolism. A 
number of studies have revealed that some genes in the MMP/ 
TIMP pathway affect the risk of ONFH. Thus, we selected 
5 SNPs of the MMP2 gene based on the minor allele frequencies 
of more than 5% in the HapMap Chinese Han population: 
rs1053605, rs243849, rs243847, rs243832, and rs7201. </p>

<p><rs corresp="#software-5" type="creator">Microsoft</rs> <rs id="software-5" type="software">Excel</rs> and <rs id="software-6" type="software">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#software-6" type="version-number">16.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-6" type="creator">SPSS</rs>, Chicago, IL) were used to 
perform statistical analyses. Throughout the document, P values 
were 2-sided; furthermore, P values less than 0.05 were 
considered statistically significant. The age difference of cases 
and controls was calculated by Welch t tests, and the exact test 
was used to determine whether the SNPs departed from the 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The association between 
the minor allele and the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH was 
evaluated by Pearson x 
2 test. To assess the association between 
each genotype and the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH, 5 models 
were used, including the codominant, dominant, recessive, 
overdominant, and log-additive model. Finally, the <rs type="software">SHEsis</rs> 
software platform 
[22] and <rs id="software-8" type="software">Haploview</rs> software package (version 
<rs corresp="#software-8" type="version-number">4.2</rs>) (<rs corresp="#software-8" type="creator">Broad Institute</rs>, Cambridge, MA) were used to analyze the 
patterns of LD, haplotype construction, and the genetic 
association at polymorphic loci. 
[23] Odds ratios (ORs) and 
95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) could show whether the 
frequencies between cases and controls had a significant 
difference. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was 
adjusted for age. In order to eliminate the probability of false-
positive results, Bonferroni multiple adjustment was applied to 
the level of significance, which was set at P &lt; 0.0017 (0.05/30). </p>

<p>3. Results </p>

<p>In this case-control study, all participants were males. The age 
characteristic is presented in Table 1. We selected 695 
individuals, including 299 alcohol-induced ONFH patients 
(age: 43.24 ± 13.07) and 396 healthy controls (age: 47.62 ± 
10.28). A total of 5 SNPs were analyzed in the study. Gene, 
chromosomal position, the minor/major allele frequency, HWE 
test, and Pearson x 
2 test results for all the SNPs are presented in 
Table 2. The HWE test was used to check whether the surveyed 
population approached the genetic equilibrium and whether 
random sampling requirements were achieved. P &gt; 0.05 showed 
that the SNPs met the HWE, so none of the SNPs was excluded. 
The differences in the frequency distribution of alleles between 
cases and controls were compared by Pearson x 
2 test. We found 
that 1 significant SNP of the MMP2 gene was associated with the 
risk of alcohol-induced ONFH at a level of 5% (rs243849 OR = 
1.33, 95% CI = 1.02-1.75, P = 0.037). 
Next, we assumed that the minor allele of each SNP was a risk 
factor and analyzed the association between each variant and the 
risk of alcohol-induced ONFH under 5 genetic models 
(codominant, dominant, recessive, overdominant, and log-
addictive) (Tables 3 and 4). The Akaike information criterion 
and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) were used to select 
the optimal model among candidate models, as discussed in the 
study by Vrieze. 
[24] The "T" allele of rs243849 was found to 
increase the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH under the log-
addictive model by unconditional logistic regression analysis 
without adjustments (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.01-1.73, P = 
0.041) (Table 3). Moreover, unconditional logistic regression 
analysis adjusted for age was used for further analysis of the 
association of each SNP with the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH 
(Table 4). Similarly, we found that rs243849 was associated with 
increased odds of developing alcohol-induced ONFH in the log-
addictive model in the North-Chinese male population (OR = 
1.36, 95% CI = 1.03-1.79, P = 0.027). Conversely, the recessive 
model revealed that the genotype "CC" in rs243832 and the 
genotype "CC" in rs7201 decreased the risk of alcohol-induced 
ONFH (rs243832 OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.40-0.98, P = 0.037; 
rs7201 OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.24-0.98, P = 0.035). We did not 
find any statistically significant association between the risk of 
alcohol-induced ONFH and the loci rs1053605 and rs243847 
using the 5 models. However, after Bonferroni multiple 
adjustment was applied to our data, no SNP in our study was 
significantly related to alcohol-induced ONFH. 
Finally, haplotype analysis results showed that 2 blocks have 
the LD, rs243849-rs243847 and rs243832-rs7201, and the D' 
values were 1 and 0.99, respectively (Fig. 1). The haplotype "TT" 
of the rs243849 and rs243847 block was found to be associated 
with an increased risk of alcohol-induced ONFH by Pearson x </p>

0.028). However, no significant haplotype was identified in the

<p>several genetic markers for alcohol-induced ONFH had already 
been found. 
[27,28] In our study, we identified the association of 5 
SNPs in the MMP2 gene with the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH 
in the male Chinese Han population from the area of Shanxi. Our 
result showed that MMP2, found on chromosome 16, might be 
associated with the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH. The 
haplotype "TT" was associated with a 1.41-fold increase in 
the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH. 
Alcohol-induced ONFH is a serious and complex condition 
characterized by the apoptosis of osteocytes and an imbalance in 
bone metabolism, caused by a disruption in the dynamic 
equilibrium of bone formation and breakdown and in the 
prosoplasia of bone marrow stromal cells. 
[3,29] Patients present 
with pain and limited hip-joint movement, caused by bone 
trabecula breakage and collapse of the subchondral bone, or with 
abnormal lipid metabolism and intravascular coagulation, which 
result in necrosis of the femoral head. 
[30,31] Some studies report 
that normal repair mechanisms might be disrupted after bone 
death, and the repair process probably takes place in the form of 
bone remodeling coupled with bone resorption and bone 
formation. 
[32] Generally, cellular responses in the physiologic 
cycle of bone remodeling involve a series of highly regulated 
steps, containing "resting," "activation," "resorption," "rever-
sal," and "formation" phases. 
[33] Both osteoblasts and osteo-
clasts are the primary functional cells involved in the process of 
bone remodeling. Osteoclasts attach to the mineralized bone 
surface and initiate bone resorption by secreting hydrogen ions 
and by digesting bone collagen. Afterward, osteoblasts migrate to 
the bone resorption site and secrete bone matrix, which then 
mineralizes and forms new bone. The balance of the bone 
remodeling process plays a key role in maintaining normal bone 
mass. 
MMPs are not only directly involved in bone matrix 
degradation but can also promote osteoclast migration and 
attachment. In fact, it has been demonstrated that osteoblasts 
have the ability to secrete MMPs. 
[34,35] MMPs are maintained at 
a normal level under the regulation of a variety of factors. During 
inflammation, MMPs regulate the differentiation of osteoblasts 
and bone resorption by osteoclasts to complete the repair of the 
necrotic bone. Moreover, it has been suggested that MMP2, 
which is encoded by the MMP2 gene located in 16q12.2, 
contributes to bone remodeling. 
[36] According to Keiichi Inoue, it 
plays a crucial role in forming and maintaining the osteocyte 
canalicular network, whose formation is a determining factor of 
bone remodeling and mineralization. 
[37,38] A report suggested 
that the abnormal expression of MMP2 causes osteolysis. 
[39] The </p>

<p>upregulation of MMP2 induces the MMP/TIMP pathway, which 
in turn activates osteoclast bone resorption and accelerates 
osteoblast apoptosis and bone matrix degradation. The balance 
between bone resorption and bone formation is thus disrupted, 
and this imbalance could be the most important mechanism of 
collapse in ONFH. 
[32] Therefore, MMP2 is an important 
regulatory gene in alcohol-induced ONFH patients. We have 
not found any evidence for the role of heredity between MMP2 
and the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH in Chinese males. In this 
case-control study, carriers of the rs243849 "T" allele exhibited 
a 1.33-, 1.32-, and 1.36-fold, statistically significant increase in 
the susceptibility of alcohol-induced ONFH by the allele model, 
log-additive model without adjustments, and log-additive model 
adjusted for age, respectively. The patients who had the 
genotypes "CC" of rs243832 and "CC" of rs7201 had a 
decreased susceptibility of alcohol-induced ONFH. After 
Bonferroni multiple adjustment was applied, no significant 
association was found. However, the rs243849 risk allele "T" 
and rs243847 wild type allele "T" constituted the haplotype 
"TT", which, compared to the wild type "CT", increased the risk 
of alcohol-induced ONFH. Because Bonferroni correction is the 
most conservative approach, the variability of MMP2 may be a 
risk factor in the Chinese males. 
In summary, we identified 5 SNPs of the MMP2 gene and 
found that the variability of MMP2 could be a biomarker for the 
risk of alcohol-induced ONFH. It is important to note that there 
were several limitations in our case-control study, such as limited 
sample size and lack of corresponding clinical information. Thus, 
further research is needed to verify our results, especially due to 
the lack of previous research on this topic. It is possible that 
MMP2 polymorphisms are related to the risk of alcohol-induced 
ONFH, and these data provide a theoretical foundation for 
future studies of this correlation in the Chinese population or in 
other populations. </p>

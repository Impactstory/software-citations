<p>The clinical effectiveness and safety of GLP-1 RAs compared to </p>

<p>each other and to oral antihyperglycemic drugs (OAD) have been </p>

<p>assessed in several meta-analyses. 9-11 However, the positioning of </p>

<p>GLP-1 RAs within the treatment paradigm is at the point when the </p>

<p>use of basal insulin might also be considered; therefore, there is an </p>

<p>increasing desire to understand the similarities and differences </p>

<p>between GLP-1 RAs and basal insulins. Although such comparisons </p>

<p>have been published, 11-16 they all have limitations to consider. Wang </p>

<p>et al. 15 do not include the two new agents (dulaglutide and albiglu-</p>

<p>tide) and, although Karagiannis et al. 10 do include the new treat-</p>

<p>ments, their analysis is limited to only once-weekly GLP-1 RAs. Liu </p>

<p>et al. 13 on the other hand, pooled all GLP-1 RAs together when com-</p>

<p>paring to insulin glargine. Such pooling assumes, a priori, that all GLP-</p>

<p>1 RAs are similar in efficacy and pharmacodynamic profile, which is </p>

<p>not the case as demonstrated in head-to-head studies. 17,18 More </p>

<p>recently, Zaccardi et al. 16 conducted an analysis where GLP-1 RAs </p>

<p>were considered independently, but basal insulins were pooled, again </p>

<p>making an a priori assumption that all basal insulins have the same </p>

<p>efficacy and pharmaocodynamic profile. Pooling also discounts the </p>

<p>heterogeneity between GLP-1 RA trials regarding background ther-</p>

<p>apy and drug dosage; as such, it is imperative that heterogeneity </p>

<p>using appropriate measures is assessed prior to combining treatments </p>

<p>for analytical purposes. To this end, to evaluate the clinical efficacy of </p>

<p>GLP-1 RAs, by type, vs basal insulins, we conducted a systematic </p>

<p>review of the literature and a series of paired meta-analyses to assess </p>

<p>the differences in glycaemic control, weight change and the risk of </p>

<p>hypoglycaemia in adults with type 2 diabetes. </p>

<p>2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS </p>

<p>2.1 | Data sources and searches </p>

<p>MEDLINE (including Epub ahead of print and In-process citations), </p>

<p>EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials </p>

<p>(CENTRAL) databases were searched from database inception to </p>

<p>September 9, 2016. The searches were limited to peer-reviewed </p>

<p>studies in the English language. Separate search strategies were </p>

<p>designed for each database (MEDLINE strategy is included in Appen-</p>

<p>dix S1, Supporting Information). Each search strategy included free-</p>

<p>text, MeSH and EMTREE terms, where appropriate, for type 2 diabe-</p>

<p>tes and GLP-1 RAs, and a randomized controlled trial (RCT) study </p>

<p>design filter in MEDLINE and EMBASE. </p>

<p>2.2 | Study selection </p>

<p>Included RCTs were selected based on predefined eligibility criteria </p>

<p>using the population, intervention, comparators, outcomes and study </p>

<p>design (PICOS) framework. Eligibility criteria included: (1) adults with </p>

<p>type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by OADs; (2) treatment of </p>

<p>the majority of subjects with US approved dosages of GLP-1 RA (exe-</p>

<p>natide 10 μg twice daily, liraglutide 1.2 or 1.8 mg once daily, exena-</p>

<p>tide 2 mg once weekly (long acting release [LAR]), lixisenatide 20 μg </p>

<p>once daily, albiglutide 30 or 50 mg once weekly, and dulaglutide 0.75 </p>

<p>or 1.5 mg once weekly plus at least one OAD; (3) comparator arm of </p>

<p>basal insulin (ie, insulin detemir, insulin glargine, insulin degludec, neu-</p>

<p>tral protamine hagedorn [NPH] insulin) plus at least one OAD; and </p>

<p>(4) RCT duration of at least 16 weeks. Trials performed in treatment-</p>

<p>naïve patients with type 2 diabetes, or samples that recruited only </p>

<p>patients with comorbidities including renal failure or cardiovascular </p>

<p>comorbidities, were excluded. Two reviewers independently deter-</p>

<p>mined whether the RCTs met eligibility criteria. Each reviewer first </p>

<p>reviewed the titles and abstracts; full-text articles were reviewed </p>

<p>where eligibility could not be determined from the title and abstract </p>

<p>review alone. Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by </p>

<p>consensus, or adjudicated by a third reviewer. </p>

<p>2.3 | Data extraction and quality assessment </p>

<p>Data extraction was performed by a single experienced data extractor </p>

<p>into a customized spreadsheet; key fields were validated by a second </p>

<p>extractor. Discrepancies were resolved as described previously for </p>

<p>study selection. The extraction form was designed to collect data </p>

<p>reporting study design features, baseline patient demographics and </p>

<p>clinical characteristics, treatment arm details, efficacy (glycated hemo-</p>

<p>globin [HbA1c], weight) and safety outcomes (hypoglycemia, gastroin-</p>

<p>testinal adverse events). </p>

<p>Endpoints at week 26 (AE10 weeks) were extracted and reported. </p>

<p>If data at week 26 were unavailable, the data closest to week </p>

<p>26 between weeks 16 and 36 were included. For trials that presented </p>

<p>endpoints in graph format only, values were derived by digitizing the </p>

<p>graph, using the <rs id="software-1" type="software">WebPlotDigitizer</rs> program available online (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="url">http://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer/app/</rs>/). This was necessary for </p>

<p>4 studies. 19-22 A risk assessment of bias was performed for each </p>

<p>included RCT using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. 23 Two </p>

<p>reviewers independently assessed the quality of each included RCT. </p>

<p>2.4 | Data synthesis and statistical analysis </p>

<p>Mean values and associated measures of variability (variance, stand-</p>

<p>ard deviation [SD], standard error [SE] or confidence interval [CI]) for </p>

<p>continuous endpoints, and counts and proportions for categorical </p>

<p>endpoints were extracted. For the purposes of the meta-analyses, if </p>

<p>SINGH ET AL. </p>

<p>
SD was not reported, it was imputed from other available information </p>

<p>(eg, SE or 95% CI), using the prognostic method described by Ma </p>

<p>et al. 24 Where sample sizes for HbA1c and weight outcomes were </p>

<p>not reported, the intention-to-treat (ITT) population was assumed. </p>

<p>Where sample sizes for hypoglycaemia endpoints were not reported, </p>

<p>if available, the safety population was assumed; otherwise the ITT </p>

<p>population was assumed. </p>

<p>The meta-analyses were conducted using the "meta" statistical </p>

<p>package in R version 3.1.3. 25 To understand the difference between </p>

<p>GLP-1 RAs and basal insulins by drug, fixed-effect pairwise meta-</p>

<p>analyses using the frequentist approach were conducted for the </p>

<p>changes in HbA1c and weight, and the occurrence of hypoglycaemia </p>

<p>outcomes. Random effects analysis were considered where apprecia-</p>

<p>ble statistical heterogeneity was observed. However, when a small </p>

<p>number of studies are available for analysis, as was the case for this </p>

<p>analysis, random effects analysis shows poor precision of between-</p>

<p>study variance, and are therefore not appropriate. 26 In keeping with </p>

<p>the Cochrane handbook, meta-analyses were conducted where data </p>

<p>were available for at least 2 separate trials with the same treat-</p>

<p>ments. 27 If data for a treatment were identified in only 1 trial, meta-</p>

<p>analysis was not conducted; however, the trial results are shown. 
"Hypoglycaemia" outcomes included all attributions of hypoglycaemia </p>

<p>in a publication (irrespective of blood glucose value), including severe </p>

<p>hypoglycaemia. The "severe hypoglycaemia" category included publi-</p>

<p>cation attribution as severe or major hypoglycaemia or definition of 
"requiring third-party assistance." However, meta-analysis for severe </p>

<p>hypoglycaemia could not be conducted because of low event rates; </p>

<p>as such, only the proportion of patients experiencing severe hypogly-</p>

<p>caemia events in GLP-1 RA groups vs basal insulins were extracted </p>

<p>and presented. To calculate the weight contribution by individual </p>

<p>trials to the overall effect estimate, the inverse variance method for </p>

<p>continuous outcomes and the Mantel-Haenszel for categorical out-</p>

<p>comes were used. </p>

<p>Statistical tests of heterogeneity were conducted to understand </p>

<p>the extent to which the results of trials included in the meta-analysis </p>

<p>were consistent. The main measure of heterogeneity used for evalua-</p>

<p>tion was I 2 value. 27 Sub-group sensitivity analysis was conducted by </p>

<p>excluding one study to understand the impact of non-standard dosing </p>

<p>used in a minority (37.9%) of patients. 20 </p>

<p>Each model was coded, analysed and summarized using forest </p>

<p>plots. The forest plots summarize effect estimates from all included </p>

<p>trials to provide a comprehensive view of available evidence, as well </p>

<p>as a pooled effect size from meta-analysis. For change in HbA1c and </p>

<p>weight, a mean difference &lt;0 signifies the result favouring the GLP-1 </p>

<p>RA arm compared to the basal insulin arm, ie, a greater reduction in </p>

<p>HbA1c or weight compared to basal insulin. For hypoglycaemia, an </p>

<p>odds ratio &lt;1 indicates lower odds in the GLP-1 RA arm compared to </p>

<p>basal insulin. Where meta-analyses were conducted (ie, 2 or more </p>

<p>trials were available for a treatment and comparator), I 2 value was </p>

<p>also reported. Codes designed for meta-analyses and their outputs </p>

<p>were validated by a second analyst. </p>

<p>detemir, glargine or degludec. Eligible studies reporting NPH insulin </p>

<p>were not identified. Study endpoints were reported at 16, 24, 26, 28, </p>

<p>52, 78, 156 and 168 weeks. Fifteen RCTs reported HbA1c and body-</p>

<p>weight change from baseline, 9 reported hypoglycemic episodes and </p>

<p>11 reported severe hypoglycemic episodes. As data for the dulaglu-</p>

<p>tide 1.5 mg dose, albiglutide 30 and 50 mg doses and lixisentatide </p>

<p>20 μg were identified in only 1 study each, meta-analysis could not </p>

<p>be performed for these doses. The insulin titration algorithms and </p>

<p>fasting plasma glucose (FPG) targets are shown in Table S1, Support-</p>

<p>ing Information. HbA1c, weight and FPG change from baseline are </p>

<p>shown in Tables S2 to S4, Supporting Information respectively. </p>

<p>Mean patient age in the included studies ranged from 52.2 to </p>

<p>59.8 years and mean disease duration ranged from 4.0 to 9.9 years. </p>

<p>Slightly more males were represented in the study populations. Mean </p>

<p>baseline HbA1c levels ranged from 7.4% to 9.1% (57-76 mmol/mol); the </p>

<p>median across trials was 8.2%. Mean bodyweight ranged from 69.95 to </p>

<p>101.40 kg and mean body mass index (BMI) ranged from 25.90 to </p>

<p>35.89 kg/m 2 . Mean fasting glucose values at baseline varied from 8.6 to </p>

<p>12.2 mmol/L (Table S4, Supporting Information). Two trials were con-</p>

<p>ducted in Asian populations 28,29 and the other trials that reported ethnic-</p>

<p>ity were conducted in mostly white populations. 21,22,30-35 </p>

<p>3.1 | Risk of bias </p>

<p>The risk of bias for all trials included is presented in Figure S1, Sup-</p>

<p>porting Information. Selection bias was assessed as unclear in </p>

<p>7 trials 20,22,31,36-39 for random sequence generation and in </p>

<p>4 trials 20,36-38 for allocation concealment. Absence of reporting was </p>

<p>the main reason for the decision to assign an RCT as presenting </p>

<p>unclear risk of bias. All trials were open label. Attrition bias (see </p>

<p>incomplete outcome data) was assessed to be low in </p>

<p>12 trials 19-22,28-31,33-35,38 (percentage of patients lost to follow-up </p>

<p>reported as 0%-3% in all arms) and was unclear in 3. 36,37,39 Two trials </p>

<p>were deemed to have an unclear risk with regard to reporting. 36,37 </p>

<p>3.2 | Efficacy outcomes </p>

<p>3.2.1 | Glycemic control </p>

<p>Of the 15 RCTs identified by the systematic review, 11 studies </p>

<p>reported change in HbA1c at 26 weeks (AE10 weeks) and had compa-</p>

<p>rable data from at least 2 studies to allow for a pairwise meta-analy-</p>

<p>sis. These included 5 trials of exenatide 10 μg vs insulin </p>

<p>glargine 19,20,34,37,38 ; 2 trials of exenatide 2 mg LAR vs insulin glar-</p>

<p>gine 29,33 ; 2 trials of liraglutide 1.8 mg vs insulin glargine 36,39 ; and </p>

<p>2 trials of dulaglutide 0.75 mg vs insulin glargine. 21,28 Four studies </p>

<p>could not be included in the pair-wise meta-analysis as the require-</p>

<p>ment of comparable data for the same dose or comparator insulin </p>

<p>from 2 studies was not met. These studies compared exenatide 2 mg </p>

<p>LAR vs insulin detemir, 30 liraglutide 1.8 mg vs insulin degludec, 31 albi-</p>

<p>glutide 30 mg titrated to 50 mg (as required) vs insulin glargine 22 and </p>

<p>lixisentatide 20 μg vs insulin glargine. 35 In addition, although 2 studies </p>

<p>were available for a pair-wise meta-analysis of the 0.75 mg dose of </p>

<p>dulaglutide 21,28 to be performed, only 1 study reported both doses of </p>

<p>dulaglutide (0.75 and 1.5 mg). 21 In the absence of another study with </p>

<p>the 1.5 mg dose, a pair-wise analysis for this dose could not be per-</p>

<p>formed. A summary of all evidence identified by the systematic </p>

<p>review and the results of the pairwise meta-analyses are presented in </p>

<p>Figure 2A. Mean HbA1c changes from baseline as well as the per-</p>

<p>centage of patients achieving HbA1c &lt; 7% (53 mmol/L) are pre-</p>

<p>sented in Table S2, Supporting Information. </p>

<p>Compared with insulin glargine, the mean difference in HbA1c </p>

<p>change was +0.01% (95% CI, −0.11, 0.13; I 2 = 0%) (+0.01 mmol/L </p>

<p>[95% CI, −1.2, 1.4]) with exenatide 10 μg, −0.31% (95% CI, −0.42, 
−0.19; I 2 = 75%) (−3.4 mmol/L [95% CI, −4.6, −2.1]) with exenatide </p>

<p>2 mg LAR, +0.06%, (95% CI, −0.06, 0.18; I 2 = 86.1%) (+0.7 mmol/L </p>

<p>[95% CI, −0.7, 2.0]) with liraglutide 1.8 mg and −0.39% (95% CI, 
−0.49, −0.29; I 2 = 88.6%) (−0.43 mmol/L [95% CI, −5.4, −3.2]) with </p>

<p>dulaglutide 0.75 mg (Figure 2A). </p>

<p>The RCT conducted by Bunck et al.20 included 5 different doses </p>

<p>of exenatide: 10 μg BID (62.1% of participants), 15 μg BID (3.4%), </p>

<p>10 μg 3 times daily (TID) (6.9%), 15 μg TID (3.4%) and 20 μg TID </p>

<p>(17.2%). This RCT was included in the systematic literature review </p>

<p>because the majority of participants (62.1%) received a licensed dose </p>

<p>of exenatide (10 μg BID). However, because of the different doses of </p>

<p>exenatide administered to patients as compared to other exenatide </p>

<p>10 μg BID trials, sensitivity analyses for HbA1c and weight were con-</p>

<p>ducted to understand the impact of this trial on the overall pooled </p>

<p>estimate and heterogeneity. This sensitivity analysis showed no </p>

<p>impact on the overall effect estimate or heterogeneity measure for </p>

<p>exenatide 10 μg BID vs insulin glargine with a pooled mean HbA1c </p>

<p>change of +0.01% (95% CI, −0.11, 0.13; I 2 = 0%), (+3.2 mmol/L [95% </p>

<p>CI, −1.2, 1.4]), which is the same as the pooled estimates when </p>

<p>including the Bunck et al. trial. </p>

<p>3.2.2 | Body weight </p>

<p>A summary of all evidence for bodyweight, as well as the pairwise </p>

<p>meta-analyses at 26 weeks, are presented in Figure 2B. Compared </p>

<p>with insulin glargine, the mean difference in bodyweight was −4.31 kg </p>

<p>(95% CI, −4.71, −3.90; I 2 = 76%) with exenatide 10 μg, −2.85 kg (95% </p>

<p>CI, −3.20, −2.49; I 2 = 96.5%) with exenatide 2 mg LAR, −4.65 kg (95% </p>

<p>CI, −5.08, −4.22; I 2 = 89.1%) with liraglutide 1.8 mg, and −1.98 kg </p>

<p>(95% CI, −2.32, −1.64, I 2 = 91%) with dulaglutide 0.75 mg. Removing </p>

<p>the RCT conducted by Bunck et al. 20 minimally changed the overall </p>

<p>effect estimate for exenatide 10 μg to −4.35 kg (95% CI, −4.77, −3.93; </p>

<p>I 2 = 81.5%). Mean bodyweight and BMI change from baseline are pre-</p>

<p>sented in Table S3, Supporting Information. </p>

<p>3.3 | Safety outcomes </p>

<p>3.3.1 | Hypoglycaemia </p>

<p>A summary of all evidence for hypoglycaemia as well as the pairwise </p>

<p>meta-analyses at 26 weeks are presented in Figure 3A. Compared to </p>

<p>insulin glargine, the odds ratio for a hypoglycaemic episode was 0.32 </p>

<p>(95% CI, 0.22, 0.47; I 2 = 33.2%) with exenatide 2 mg LAR and 0.40 </p>

<p>(95% CI, 0.32, 0.51; I 2 = 96%) with liraglutide 1.8 mg. A summary of </p>

<p>the evidence related to the proportion of patients experiencing a </p>

<p>hypoglycaemic episode and the background therapy is presented in </p>

<p>Figure 3B. </p>

<p>SINGH ET AL. </p>

<p>
Out of the 15 studies that reported data at week 26 (AE10 weeks), </p>

<p>11 RCTs reported data for severe hypoglycaemia. Meta-analyses of </p>

<p>severe hypoglycaemia were not conducted because of the limited </p>

<p>events observed; 3 studies reported no events in both arms 28-30 and </p>

<p>5 studies reported no events in one arm. 19,31,35,36,39 The numbers </p>

<p>and proportions of patients experiencing an episode of hypoglycae-</p>

<p>mia or an episode of severe hypoglycaemia, and the definitions of </p>

<p>hypoglycaemia and severe hypoglycaemia as described by the </p>

<p>authors are presented in Table S5, Supporting Information. </p>

<p>3.3.2 | Gastrointestinal events </p>

<p>Meta-analyses of gastrointestinal events were not conducted as </p>

<p>reporting across studies was insufficient to allow meaningful analyses </p>

<p>(data not shown). </p>

<p>4 | DISCUSSION </p>

<p>The meta-analyses show statistically significant reductions in HbA1c </p>

<p>with once-weekly exenatide 2 mg LAR and once-weekly dulaglutide </p>

<p>0.75 mg, compared to insulin glargine at 6 months, a reduction in </p>

<p>HbA1c of 0.3% (3.3 mmol/L) and 0.4% (4.4 mmol/L), respectively. In </p>

<p>contrast, once-daily liraglutide and twice-daily exenatide 10 μg did </p>

<p>not show a statistically significant difference from insulin glargine. </p>

<p>This difference between weekly and daily GLP-1 RAs may be attribu-</p>

<p>ted to the potential impact of the weekly agents on both FPG and </p>

<p>postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), compared to the daily agents that </p>

<p>may predominantly regulate PPG. </p>

<p>The systematic review identified 15 trials reporting results at </p>

<p>26 weeks (AE10 weeks). Eleven trials were included in pair-wise meta-</p>

<p>analyses: 5 trials of exenatide 10 μg vs insulin glargine 19,20,34,37,38 ; </p>

<p>2 trials of exenatide 2 mg LAR vs insulin glargine 29,33 ; 2 trials of lira-</p>

<p>glutide 1.8 mg vs insulin glargine 36,39 ; and 2 trials of dulaglutide </p>

<p>0.75 mg vs insulin glargine. 21,28 Although it was not possible to incor-</p>

<p>porate data for dulaglutide 1.5 mg, lixisenatide or albiglutide into the </p>

<p>analyses, as only 1 study for each met the inclusion criteria and at </p>

<p>least 2 studies are required for meta-analysis, it should be considered </p>

<p>that the 3-armed trial identified by the systematic review that </p>

<p>included the 1.5 mg dulaglutide dose (vs dulaglutide 0.75 mg and </p>

<p>insulin glargine) indicated that the higher dose led to a greater reduc-</p>

<p>tion in HbA1c and bodyweight compared to both dulaglutide </p>

<p>0.75 mg and insulin glargine (Figure 2). 21 With lixisenatide, a weight </p>

<p>reduction was observed compared to insulin glarine, but HbA1c </p>

<p>reduction was greater with glargine (Figure 2). 35 With albiglutide, </p>

<p>although there was weight reduction when compared with insulin </p>

<p>glargine, HbA1c reduction was not different from insulin glargine </p>

<p>(Figure 2). 22 This finding is not unexpected, however, as albiglutide </p>

<p>was inferior in glycaemic lowering efficacy when compared to liraglu-</p>

<p>tide, which in this meta-analysis also did not have a statistically signif-</p>

<p>icant HbA1c reduction when compared to insulin glargine. 18 Analyses </p>

<p>conducted for weight change from baseline demonstrated statistically </p>

<p>with basal insulins: −4.65 kg (95% CI −5.08, −4.22) for liraglutide </p>

<p>−1.98 kg (95% CI −2.32, −1.64) for dulaglutide 0.75 mg. </p>

<p>The results of the 2 pairwise meta-analyses indicated that there </p>

<p>compared to insulin glargine and also with once-weekly exenatide </p>

<p>should be interpreted with caution because of the variability in defini-</p>

<p>tions of hypoglycaemia in different studies, a challenge that has been </p>

<p>identified by the American Diabetes Association. 40 Moreover, there </p>

<p>SINGH ET AL. </p>

<p>
data were present, the event rates were too low to yield clinically </p>

<p>meaningful interpretation; as such, a meta-analysis for severe hypo-</p>

<p>glycaemia was not conducted. However, it is important to note that </p>

<p>the outcome "hypoglycaemia" reported in this article also included 
"severe hypoglycaemia". </p>

<p>It is pertinent that we acknowledge the effect that insulin titra-</p>

<p>tion may have had on the results for hypoglycaemia. The impact of </p>

<p>insulin titration was most apparent in the RCT conducted by D'Ales-</p>

<p>sio et al. 36 which compared once-daily liraglutide 1.8 mg and insulin </p>

<p>glargine with an aggressive up-titration of insulin glargine that </p>

<p>resulted in a mean insulin dose of 52 units/d at study end (Table S1, </p>

<p>Supporting Information) coupled with the down-titration of back-</p>

<p>ground SU. The result of the meta-analyses for this comparison show </p>

<p>glycaemic control in favour of insulin glargine, a greater increase in </p>

<p>weight from baseline and an increased risk of hypoglycaemia which </p>

<p>may be a result of aggressive insulin titration. In contrast, the mean </p>

<p>doses of insulin glargine in the once-weekly exenatide 2 mg LAR </p>

<p>studies used in the pairwise meta-analysis for hypoglycaemia were </p>

<p>only 16 to 31 insulin units (Table S1, Supporting Information), which </p>

<p>may have been responsible for, not only the lower risk of hypoglycae-</p>

<p>mia, but also the lesser weight gain and lower HbA1c drop with insu-</p>

<p>lin glargine. 33 It is important to point out that the titration of basal </p>

<p>insulin, even in the setting of clinical trials designed around insulin </p>

<p>titration, is often suboptimal. For example, in the treat-to-target trial </p>

<p>comparing once-daily insulin glargine with NPH insulin, the average </p>

<p>dose of insulin was 47.2 IU (SD = 1.3) for glargine and 41.8 IU </p>

<p>(SD = 1.3) for NPH. 41 Inadequate insulin dosing could also have </p>

<p>implications for a real-world setting, where basal insulin titration </p>

<p>might not always occur as it should. As such, GLP-1RAs, some of </p>

<p>which do not require any dose titration, could offer a reasonable </p>

<p>alternative to basal insulin. </p>

<p>Although our analysis attempted to minimize heterogeneity among </p>

<p>studies by ensuring that treatment regimens and outcome time points </p>

<p>were consistent, and the systematic review eligibility criteria specifying </p>

<p>that background therapy must be received concurrently with study </p>

<p>medication, any OAD was allowed as background therapy. However, </p>

<p>because of the limited evidence base, heterogeneity was observed </p>

<p>among studies, leading to uncertainty concerning the estimates. Table 1 </p>

<p>clearly indicates that background therapy varied among the included </p>

<p>studies, which could also have impacted the results. Whilst MET is </p>

<p>largely weight neutral and has a low risk of hypoglycaemia associated </p>

<p>with it, both SU and TZD treatments are associated with weight gain, </p>

<p>which should be considered when interpreting results. In addition, SUs </p>

<p>carry a moderate risk of hypoglycaemia, which is of particular impor-</p>

<p>tance because basal insulin is also associated with weight gain and an </p>

<p>increased risk of hypoglycaemia. 42 Although sensitivity analyses can be </p>

<p>conducted to assess the impact of differing background therapies, it </p>

<p>was not possible in this study because most meta-analyses included </p>

<p>only 2 trials, a number insufficient for a meaningful sensitivity analysis. </p>

<p>As the analyses for the present study were being conducted, a </p>

<p>systematic review and meta-analysis of once-weekly GLP-1 RAs was </p>

<p>published. 10 However, the current study has several important differ-</p>

<p>ences from that study and other previously published analyses. Our </p>

<p>research question was more specific than that posed by previous ana-</p>

<p>lyses. First, we considered only head-to-head comparisons with basal </p>

<p>insulins rather than with any antihyperglycemic treatment, which </p>

<p>offers more comprehensive evidence for clinicians regarding choice </p>

<p>between the two injectable options in the treatment pathway. Sec-</p>

<p>ond, rather than being restricted to once-weekly GLP-1 Ras, our anal-</p>

<p>ysis considered all licensed dosages of all GLP-1 RAs currently being </p>

<p>used in clinical practice. And finally, our analysis did not pool drugs </p>

<p>according to class; thus, each drug and dosage was considered inde-</p>

<p>pendently and we pooled only outcome data from studies within </p>

<p>the time frame of 16 to 36 weeks of treatment. Although these </p>

<p>restrictions meant that some treatments were not included in the </p>

<p>meta-analysis, notably albiglutide 30 mg (uptitrated to 50 mg as </p>

<p>needed), dulaglutide 1.5 mg (where only one study comparing it to </p>

<p>basal insulin at this dose was available) and lixisenatide 20 μg, it </p>

<p>was not thought appropriate to conduct an analysis pooling the </p>

<p>drugs, dosages or different time frames because head-to-head </p>

<p>trials of GLP-1 RAs have demonstrated differences within the </p>

<p>class. 43 Another recently published pairwise and network meta-</p>

<p>analysis sought to understand the benefits and harms of once-</p>

<p>weekly GLP-1 RAs. 16 However, that analysis considered only </p>

<p>once-weekly GLP-1 RAs and was conducted primarily to assess </p>

<p>the cardiometabolic efficacy and adverse effects of GLP-1 RAs and </p>

<p>not the comparison to basal insulin in the treatment paradigm, 16 </p>

<p>as we did in our study. </p>

<p>There are several limitations in the current systematic literature </p>

<p>review and meta-analysis that should be acknowledged. One limita-</p>

<p>tion is that only English-language articles were searched and included. </p>

<p>Although we do not envision the number of included articles to sub-</p>

<p>stantially increase if the scope of the search was expanded to include </p>

<p>non-English articles, we cannot be certain of the impact of an </p>

<p>expanded scope on the results of the meta-analysis. In addition, we </p>

<p>combined the results of trials at 26 weeks (AE10 weeks) and therefore </p>

<p>are unable to draw conclusions about the long-term efficacy and </p>

<p>safety of GLP-1 RAs compared to basal insulin; future studies should </p>

<p>explore this area. Further, a priori, we developed a protocol to ana-</p>

<p>lyse the results of the systematic review by meta-analysis. As future </p>

<p>studies are published, expanding the evidence base for GLP-1 RAs </p>

<p>compared to basal insulin, consideration of conducting an analysis </p>

<p>including both direct and indirect data by network meta-analysis may </p>

<p>be warranted. </p>

<p>The meta-analysis conducted for hypoglycemia should be inter-</p>

<p>preted with caution because of high heterogeneity in defining hypo-</p>

<p>glycaemic events, an inherent problem when conducting meta-</p>

<p>analyses in diabetes. 40 Of the 15 studies identified by the systematic </p>

<p>review, the definitions of hypoglycaemia varied considerably </p>

<p>(Table S5, Supporting Information). With the exception of the study </p>

<p>by Davies et al. 30 which required only the presence of symptoms for </p>

<p>a hypoglycaemic event to be reported, the remaining studies did </p>

<p>define a hypoglycaemic event using a blood glucose target, but this </p>

<p>target varied between 3.0 and 4.0 mmol/L depending on the study. </p>

<p>Interpretation of findings from the meta-analysis of hypoglycaemia </p>

<p>was further complicated by heterogeneity among studies with regard </p>

<p>to background therapies and insulin titration; as such, future trials </p>

<p>with similar background therapies, insulin titration algorithms and </p>

<p>standardized definitions of hypoglycaemia are warranted for compa-</p>

<p>rability of studies. </p>

<p> 
SINGH ET AL. </p>

<p>In conclusion, the current analysis indicates that once-weekly </p>

<p>GLP-1 Ras, exenatide LAR and dulaglutide, demonstrate a greater </p>

<p>reduction in HbA1c compared to basal insulin after 26 weeks of treat-</p>

<p>ment. Once-or twice-daily GLP-1 RAs, liraglutide and exenatide, also </p>

<p>demonstrate a reduction in HbA1c, but these changes were similar to </p>

<p>those seen with basal insulin. Treatment with all GLP-1 RAs results in </p>

<p>significant reduction in bodyweight as compared to basal insulins. </p>

<p>However, clarity and consistency is required in defining hypoglycae-</p>

<p>mia in clinical trials, to allow meaningful conclusions to be inferred for </p>

<p>this outcome when comparing GLP-1 RAs with basal insulin. </p>

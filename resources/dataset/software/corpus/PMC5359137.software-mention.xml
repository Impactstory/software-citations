<p>Aim: To investigate the determinants of adherence to amoxicillin in patients with acute lower 
respiratory tract infection. 
Materials and methods: Three European data sets were used. Adherence data were collected 
using self-reported diaries. Candidate determinants included factors relating to patient, condition, 
therapy, health care system/provider, and the study in which the patient participated. Logistic 
and Cox regression models were used to investigate the determinants of initiation, implementa-
tion, and discontinuation of amoxicillin. 
Results: Although initiation differed across samples, implementation and discontinuation 
were similar. Determinants of initiation were days waited before consulting, duration of 
prescription, and being in a country where a doctor-issued sick certificate is required for being 
off work for ,7 days. Implementation was higher for older participants or those with abnormal 
auscultation. Implementation was lower for those prescribed longer courses of amoxicillin 
($8 days). Time from initiation to discontinuation was longer for longer prescriptions and 
shorter for those from countries where single-handed practices were widespread. 
Conclusion: Nonadherence to amoxicillin was largely driven by noninitiation. Differing sets of 
determinants were found for initiation, implementation, and discontinuation. There is a need to 
further understand the reasons for these determinants, the impact of poor adherence to antibiotics 
on outcomes, and to develop interventions to improve antibiotic use when prescribed. 
Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), characterized by acute cough, account 
for approximately one-fifth of all consultations in primary care, and the majority of 
patients who consult are prescribed antibiotics. 
1,2 However, adherence to antibiotics 
in primary care is often poor. 
3,4 This wastes health care resources, 
5,6 could nega-
tively impact on clinical outcomes, 
7 and could result in infecting bacteria being 
exposed to sub-optimal levels of treatment; creating an environment that promotes 
antibiotic resistance. </p>

<p>8 </p>

<p>With concerns growing about the consequences of increasing levels of antimicrobial 
resistance, 
9 interventions that effectively promote the appropriate use of antibiotics 
are important. Although most antibiotic stewardship programs have focused on 
reducing antibiotic use, 
10,11 less attention has been paid to ensuring that antibiotics are 
appropriately used when prescribed. Interventions for improving adherence are likely 
to be most effective if they are informed by an understanding of the determinants of 
sub-optimal adherence. These determinants may operate on multiple levels to impact </p>

<p>on whether a patient adheres to a prescribed treatment, and 
therefore large, detailed data sets are required to accurately 
quantify these influences. 
Adherence may be defined as "the process by which 
patients take their medicine as prescribed". 
12 Traditionally, 
this has been represented quantitatively as a single variable 
(eg, percentage of medicine taken as prescribed and a binary 
taken as prescribed or not). However, recent work in this 
field encourages the use of the distinct processes involved 
in taking medicine, namely, initiation, implementation, and 
discontinuation. 
13 Each individual process may have its own 
determinants and influences on outcomes. Therefore, dif-
ferent interventions may be required to address each of the 
adherence processes. 
In this paper, we aim to investigate the determinants of 
initiation, implementation, and discontinuation of amoxi-
cillin by adults consulting with an acute LRTI in European 
primary care. </p>

<p>Materials and methods 
studies, patients, settings, and inclusion 
criteria for analysis </p>

<p>Data were used from three studies conducted as part of 
the Genomics to combat Resistance against Antibiotics in 
Community-acquired LRTI in Europe (GRACE) Network 
of Excellence research program. 
14 All three studies recruited 
adult patients aged $18 years consulting with an acute 
LRTI/cough in primary care and are described in detail 
elsewhere. In brief, Study 1 was a prospective cohort 
study conducted in 13 European countries between 2006 
and 2007; 
1 Study 2 was an observational study on the 
etiology, diagnosis, and prognosis of LRTI conducted in 
12 European countries between 2007 and 2010; 
15 and Study 3 
was a placebo-controlled trial of amoxicillin nested within 
Study 2. 
16 Following an initial consultation with a clinician, 
participants in all three studies were given a diary that 
recorded symptoms, medication use, and health care contacts. 
Participants were asked to complete their diary for 28 days. 
All three studies collected data using similar case report 
forms (CRFs) and patient diaries. Study participants were 
included in analysis if they were prescribed amoxicillin 
for immediate use at their initial consultation (defined as 
being prescribed amoxicillin and not advised to delay, as 
recorded on the CRF) and it was possible to ascertain adher-
ence measures using self-reported diary data. The present 
study focuses on the use of amoxicillin only, as this is the 
recommended first-line antibiotic for LRTI in the European 
Union. 
17 In Studies 1 and 2, participants who were prescribed </p>

<p>antibiotics other than amoxicillin were excluded. In Study 3 
(the trial), amoxicillin was the only antibiotic prescribed. </p>

<p>Definition of adherence elements </p>

<p>initiation </p>

<p>Participants were defined as having initiated their amoxicillin 
if they indicated in their diary that they took amoxicillin at 
least once during the 28 day follow-up period. </p>

<p>implementation </p>

<p>In participants who initiated their amoxicillin, implementa-
tion describes the extent to which the prescription was taken 
as prescribed among those who initiated their amoxicillin. 
For the purpose of this paper, it is defined as the proportion 
of amoxicillin reportedly taken during the prescribed period. 
For example, if a participant was prescribed amoxicillin for 
5 days and only reported taking it for 4 days during the first 
5 days of the follow-up period, their implementation score 
would be 0.8 (ie, they initiated their amoxicillin course and 
took 80% of it during the prescribing period). </p>

<p>Discontinuation </p>

<p>Participants were defined as having discontinued their 
amoxicillin prescription if they initiated their prescription and 
subsequently reported a full week of not taking their medicine. 
A gap of 1 week was deemed appropriate in distinguishing 
between patients who stopped and restarted their medicine 
and those who were prescribed a new course of amoxicillin. 
The first day of that 1-week gap was defined as the day they 
discontinued, and the time to discontinuation was calculated 
as the difference in days between the day of discontinuation 
and the day of initiation. For example, if a participant was 
prescribed a 7-day course of amoxicillin, initiated their 
amoxicillin on day 3, and days 10-17 were the first full week 
where no amoxicillin was reportedly taken, they would be 
defined as having discontinued on day 10, and their time from 
initiation to discontinuation would be 7 days. </p>

<p>candidate determinants </p>

<p>Determinants related to the patient, illness, prescription, 
and health care setting were investigated. A full description 
of the candidate determinants is given in the online supple-
mentary materials. </p>

<p>statistical analysis </p>

<p>Descriptive statistics were reported as numbers and 
percentages, means and standard deviations (SDs), or 
medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs), as appropriate. </p>

<p>Determinants of adherence to amoxicillin in patients with acute cough </p>

<p>Findings in all descriptive tables are presented both overall 
and separately for each study. 
A three-level logistic regression model was fitted to 
investigate the determinants of initiation, with participants 
nested within clinicians nested within countries. 
To investigate the determinants of implementation, a 
multilevel logistic regression model was fitted to participants 
who had initiated amoxicillin. The model allowed for 
clustering at four levels, specifically, days nested within 
participants nested within clinicians nested within countries. 
This approach, therefore, modeled implementation as the 
probability of correctly implementing on a given day. 
A Cox proportional hazards model 
18 was fitted to investi-
gate the determinants of time from initiation to discontinua-
tion. The standard errors from this model were corrected for 
the clustering of participants within clinicians. 
Throughout, results are presented in terms of odds ratios 
(ORs), hazard ratios (HRs), and associated 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs), as appropriate. Variables were entered into a 
univariable model and retained if they were significant at the 
P,0.1 level. Variables in the multivariable model that were 
not significant at the P,0.05 level were removed sequentially, 
from largest to smallest P-value, until a final multivariable 
model was attained. The study from which a participant pro-
vided data was used in all models (both univariable and mul-
tivariable) to ensure that any association was not confounded 
by the characteristics of participants from different studies. 
For initiation and implementation, the clinician and 
country-level intracluster correlation coefficients (ICCs) 
were calculated to demonstrate the proportion of variation in 
initiation/implementation that was attributable to differences </p>

<p>between clinicians and countries. Some clinicians partici-
pated in more than one of the three studies, and where this 
was the case their identifier was linked across studies.

<p>number of participants, clinicians, and primary care 
networks </p>

<p>In total, data were available for 1,346 participants prescribed 
amoxicillin for immediate use and for whom self-reported 
follow-up diary data were available (Study 3, the placebo-
controlled trial, n=848; Study 1, the prospective observational 
study, n=306; and Study 2, the observational study within 
which the trial was nested, n=192). 
Overall, participants were recruited by 322 clinicians who 
were based in 15 different countries across Europe (Figure 1). </p>

<p>Participant characteristics </p>

<p>Participants were aged between 18 and 88 years (median 51, 
IQR: 38-62). Although the age distributions in Studies 1 and 3 
were similar, those recruited into Study 2 tended to be slightly </p>

<p>older (median 58, IQR: 45-65). Overall, 540 participants 
were men (40.1%) and 372 participants had at least one 
of the listed co-morbidities (27.7%). Study 2 contained 
a higher percentage of participants with co-morbidities 
(36.5%; Table 1). </p>

<p>illness characteristics </p>

<p>Other than cough, which was part of the inclusion criteria for 
all three studies, the five most frequently reported symptoms 
were phlegm (81.3%), feeling generally unwell (79.8%), 
interference with normal activities (69.6%), disturbed 
sleep (64.5%), and shortness of breath (59.0%). Fever and 
headache were most frequently reported by participants 
in Study 1 and coryza by participants in Study 3. Phlegm, 
shortness of breath, wheeze, disturbed sleep, feeling generally 
unwell, and diarrhea were the symptoms most frequently 
reported by participants in Study 2 (Table 1). 
Overall, the median clinician-rated symptom severity 
score at recruitment was 36 (IQR: 25-46), with participants 
from Study 2 reporting the highest average symptom severity 
(median =38, IQR: 26-48) and those from Study 3 the lowest 
(median =35, IQR: 25-46). Abnormal findings on ausculta-
tion examination were found in 652 participants (48.5%), </p>

<p>with participants in Study 3 least likely to have abnormal 
findings (34.3%). Discolored phlegm was reported by 680 
participants (53.2%; Table 1). </p>

<p>Prescription characteristics </p>

<p>Although participants in Study 3 were prescribed a fixed dose, 
frequency, and duration of amoxicillin, it was not fixed for 
participants in the other two studies. For these participants, 
the most frequently prescribed dose was 500 mg (218, or 
44.2% of all participants were prescribed this dose), with 393 
instructed to take their medication three or more times a day 
(79.2%), and 339 prescribed a 6-or 7-day course (68.3%). 
Participants in Study 1 were more likely to be prescribed 
higher doses to be taken less frequently and for a shorter 
duration, than those in Study 2 (Table 2). </p>

<p>healthcare setting characteristics </p>

<p>Of the 15 countries included, single-handed practices were 
common in six (40.0%), campaigns around antibiotic use 
had recently been conducted in seven (46.7%), patients 
were required to pay to see a general practitioner at the point 
of delivery of care in seven (46.7%), and a doctor-issued 
sick certificate was required for certifying people off work </p>

<p>Determinants of adherence to amoxicillin in patients with acute cough </p>

<p>for ,7 days in three (20.0%). Amoxicillin was the first-line 
choice of antibiotic in the national guidelines of six of the 
countries (40.0%), and antibiotic prescribing rates ranged 
from 11.2 defined daily doses per 1,000 inhabitants/day 
(the Netherlands) to 28.6 defined daily doses per 1,000 inhab-
itants/day (France), with six countries categorized as low 
prescribers (the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, Slovenia, 
Norway, and Hungary), five as moderate (England, Wales, 
Finland, Spain, and Poland), and four as high prescribers 
(Slovakia, Belgium, Italy, and France) (Table 3). </p>

<p>Analysis </p>

<p>initiation </p>

<p>While overall, a high proportion of participants initiated their 
amoxicillin (1,057 or 78.5% of participants), this was largely 
driven by the almost-complete initiation of amoxicillin seen 
in Study 3 (97.6%). Initiation in participants from Study 1 
and Study 2 was considerably lower (51.0% and 38.0%, 
respectively). When initiation occurred, it was mostly on 
the day of prescription (91.5% of participants who initiated 
did so on day 1). 
Compared to those who had waited #7 days, partici-
pants who had waited $15 days prior to consulting had 
higher odds of initiating their amoxicillin (OR =2.77, 95% 
CI: 1.35-5.67). There was some evidence that the duration 
of the prescription was also associated with amoxicillin 
initiation. Participants who were prescribed amoxicillin 
for $8 days had higher odds of initiating their amoxicillin 
than those prescribed for #5 days, although this was not 
statistically significant at the 5% level (OR =2.29, 95% CI: 
0.97-5.42). Participants in countries where a sick certifi-
cate was required for taking ,7 days off work had higher 
odds of initiating their amoxicillin (OR =2.15, 95% CI: 
1.27-3.64) (Table 4). 
The ICC from the final multivariable model indicated 
that 17% of the total variation in initiation was attributable 
to differences between clinicians. The country-level ICC 
was negligible. </p>

<p>implementation </p>

<p>In participants who initiated amoxicillin, implementation 
levels were high and highly skewed across all three studies. 
Full implementation was achieved by 827 participants overall 
(78.3%), with full implementation across studies ranging 
from 70.8% of participants in Study 2 (51/72) to 80.0% in 
Study 3 (662/828) (Figure 2). 
The odds of implementing amoxicillin on a given day 
were higher among older participants (OR for a decade 
increase =1.21, 95% CI: 1.03-1.41), and there was some 
evidence that it was higher for participants with abnormal </p>

<p>auscultation findings at their index consultation, although 
the 95% CI included 1 (OR =1.71, 95% CI: 1.00-2.91). 
The odds were lower for participants prescribed courses of 
amoxicillin lasting $8 days (OR compared to courses lasting 
up to 5 days =0.07, 95% CI: 0.01-0.42) (Table 5). 
Sixty-two percent of the total variation in whether 
amoxicillin was taken on a given day was attributable to 
differences between participants. The clinician and country-
level ICCs were both 0.04. </p>

<p>Discontinuation </p>

<p>The median time from initiation to discontinuation of amoxicillin 
was 7 days across all three studies (overall IQR: 7-8 days). 
Longer courses were associated with a longer time 
to discontinuation (HR for 6-7 days compared with #5 
days =0.30, 95% CI: 0.17-0.55, HR for $8 days compared 
with #5 days =0.19, 95% CI: 0.10-0.36). Participants from 
countries where single-handed practices were widespread 
were associated with a shorter time until discontinuation 
(HR =1.15, 95% CI: 1.03-1.28). The findings persisted 
when the standard errors were corrected for clustering of 
participants within countries. </p>

<p>Differences across studies </p>

<p>As indicated by the forest plots presented in the online 
supplementary materials, there was insufficient evidence to 
suggest that the determinants found in the models for initia-
tion, implementation, and discontinuation differed within 
the individual studies. </p>

<p>Determinants of adherence to amoxicillin in patients with acute cough </p>

<p>Discussion 
Summary of key findings </p>

<p>In this pooled analysis of three European studies of 
amoxicillin treatment for LRTI in primary care, participants 
who had waited longer before consulting or were prescribed 
a longer course of amoxicillin were more likely to initiate 
their course. In those who did initiate amoxicillin, older 
participants, or those with abnormal chest findings were more 
likely to implement their amoxicillin correctly on a given 
day. Participants were less likely to correctly implement their 
amoxicillin on a given day if they were prescribed a longer 
course. A considerable amount of variation in initiation and 
implementation was attributable to differences between 
clinicians, and the odds of initiation were higher in countries 
where sick certificates were required for being absent from 
work for ,7 days. Course length (time from initiation to 
discontinuation) was longer in countries where single-handed 
practices were common. </p>

<p>strengths and limitations </p>

<p>This is the first study to separately investigate the deter-
minants of initiation, implementation, and discontinuation 
of antibiotic treatment and builds on previous work where 
we have described initiation, partial, and full adherence 
to antibiotics prescribed in primary care. 
3 In that study, 
we found that the odds of fully adhering to treatment was 
positively associated with the duration of symptoms prior to 
consulting, negatively associated with the duration of pre-
scribed treatment, and varied according to antibiotic class. 
This analysis used a large amount of prospective primary 
care data from patients in diverse settings in Europe, using 
similar data collection methods and with similar inclusion </p>

<p>criteria. The determinants of nonadherence to medication can 
be multifaceted. 
9 Four of the five World Health Organization-
defined dimensions were investigated, and it was possible 
to assess the clustering of initiation and implementation 
behavior by clinician, which gave an indication of the influ-
ence of clinician attributes on patients' antibiotic treatment 
adherence. Characteristics of the countries from which 
patients were recruited were obtained and investigated, rather 
than estimating the differences between the countries them-
selves. This provided more useful information, as the goal 
of this study was to investigate determinants as a platform 
for intervening in the process, rather than simply to describe 
variation by country. 
Our findings are consistent with previous studies of adher-
ence to antibiotic treatment and other treatments alike. </p>

<p>21-25 </p>

<p>Separating out adherence into distinct processes enabled 
different sets of determinants to be considered. The pro-
cesses are distinct, and indeed different determinants were 
associated with each. Had adherence been considered as a 
single variable, such nuances would have been missed. This 
approach made fuller use of the available data. 
The analysis in this paper focuses on adherence to 
amoxicillin prescriptions for immediate use only. Although 
this reduces the potential number of participants (other 
antibiotics were prescribed and delayed prescriptions were 
given in the included observational studies), it allowed for 
the investigation of the impact of the dose, frequency, and 
duration without being confounded by the type of antibiotic 
prescribed. As amoxicillin is the most commonly prescribed 
and recommended antibiotic for acute respiratory infections 
across Europe, 
1,17 the results retain wide applicability. Advice 
regarding delayed prescriptions, while also recommended for 
this condition, 
26 are often vague (eg, here is a prescription 
if you get any worse), and may have been issued with the 
intention that the patient would never actually take antibiotic 
treatment. The work presented in this paper assumes that 
amoxicillin was prescribed for immediate use by a clinician 
with the intention that it would be taken as prescribed. 
Our estimation of initiation, implementation, and discon-
tinuation is based on data obtained from self-reported diaries. 
Although this type of measure is prone to bias, 
27,28 by having 
a daily entry, these biases are likely to be minimized. This 
method is also generally more feasible on larger populations, 
compared to more precise measures (eg, electronic monitor-
ing) and provides more informative data than tablet counts, 
which can only provide an overall measure of consumption. 
However, questions in the diary only asked about daily the 
use of treatment. We have, therefore, had to assume that if </p>

<p>a participant reported that they consumed amoxicillin on a 
given day, they consumed the correct number of doses and 
these doses were spread evenly throughout the day -an 
assumption that could have been checked with a measure, 
such as electronic monitoring. 
To reduce any biases that may arise, from comparing 
adherence to medication in observational studies and trials, 
all analyses controlled for the study from which a patient 
participated. </p>

<p>implications </p>

<p>Clinicians may be able to improve adherence to prescribed 
antibiotics, especially in those most likely to benefit from 
antibiotic treatment, by considering which patients are unlikely 
to start or incorrectly implement their prescription. 
There are no obvious, evidence-based, reasons for varia-
tion in adherence related to the determinants we identified. 
There is a need to further understand the reasons for these 
determinants and to develop interventions to improve 
antibiotic use in this setting. However, the determinants that 
were found associated with initiation and implementation 
(particularly days with symptoms prior to consulting and 
auscultation findings) may imply that an intervention that 
addresses patients' perceptions about their illness might 
help improve adherence. Given the degree of clustering of 
initiation and implementation at the level of the responsible 
clinician, an intervention that was delivered by clinicians 
would seem most likely to be effective. 
Given the theorized association between sub-optimal 
exposure to antibiotics and the development of antibiotic 
resistance, time from initiation to discontinuation (regardless 
of how correctly the medicine was implemented) does not 
seem to be a priority target for intervention. Although it is an 
element that has value in other areas (eg, medicines to be taken 
long term and for which there may not be a defined end date), 
its value for antibiotics for acute conditions is questionable. 
Selection of resistance may already occur after the first 
dose of an antibiotic, and therefore initiation of antibiotic 
treatment may be the main driver of antibiotic resistance, not 
necessarily implementation or discontinuation. 
29 Nonadher-
ence was driven by noninitiation. Different determinants were 
found for each adherence element. </p>

<p>Future research </p>

<p>Future work should focus on establishing whether there is 
a causal relationship between noninitiation, poor imple-
mentation, and clinical outcomes (eg, patient recovery, 
hospitalizations, re-consultations, and short-and long-term </p>

<p>carriage of antibiotic-resistant organisms). Should a link be 
established, the findings reported in this paper could inform 
the development of an intervention that improves initiation and 
implementation, and in turn improves clinical outcomes for 
patients with acute respiratory infections in primary care. </p>

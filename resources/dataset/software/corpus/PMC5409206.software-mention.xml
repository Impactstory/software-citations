<p>ABSTRACT : Potassium channels, the largest group of pore proteins, selectively regulate the flow of potassium (K </p>

<p>+ </p>

<p>) ions 
across cell membranes. The activity and expression of K 
+ channels are critical for the maintenance of normal functions in ves-</p>

<p>sels and neurons, and for the regulation of cell differentiation and maturation. However, their role and expression in stem cells </p>

<p>have been poorly understood. In this study, we isolated perivascular stem cells (PVCs) from human umbilical cords and inves-
tigated the expression patterns of big-conductance Ca </p>

<p>2+ </p>

<p>Perivascular stem cells (PVCs), originating from mesen-</p>

<p>chymal stem cells (MSCs), have greater proliferation and </p>

<p>differentiation potentials compared to those of bone mar-</p>

<p>row-derived MSCs (Crisan et al., 2008). Among the PVC </p>

<p>sources, human umbilical cords (HUC) have some ad-</p>

<p>vantages over other tissues because they are easily acces-</p>

<p>sible as a clinical waste product and have low inherent </p>

<p>immunogenicity (Nagamura-Inoue et al., 2014). For these </p>

<p>reasons, HUCPVCs have drawn considerable interest as a </p>

<p>promising material for regenerative medicine. In recent </p>

<p>years, the therapeutic effects of HUCPVCs on various di-</p>

<p>seases have been reported. Tsang et al. (2013) showed that </p>

<p>HUCPVCs contributed to skeletal regeneration by generat-</p>

<p>ing a matrix and recruiting resident progenitors in a bone </p>

<p>defect model. HUCPVCs also contributed to the repair of </p>

<p>injured lung tissue as well as protected against neuro-</p>

<p>degenerative diseases through paracrine effects (Mon-  temurro et al., 2011; Appaix et al., 2014). Thus, the identi-</p>

<p>fication and functional assessment of internal and external </p>

<p>factors regulating PVC functions are critical for improving </p>

<p>their therapeutic potential. </p>

<p>Potassium channels, the largest group of pore proteins, </p>

<p>are widely distributed in various cell types (Day et al.,   1993; Park et al., 2007). They selectively regulate the flow </p>

<p>E Kim, WS Park, S-H Hong </p>



<p>of potassium (K </p>

<p>+ </p>

<p>) ions across cell membranes (Day et al.,   1993). K 
+ channels have important roles in maintaining </p>

<p>normal functions and physiological homeostasis in various </p>

<p>cell types as well as regulating the cell cycle, differentia-</p>

<p>tion, and maturation (Kawano et al., 2002). Although se-</p>

<p>veral studies have characterized the electrophysiological </p>

<p>properties of MSCs and pluripotent stem cells (Heubach et   al., 2003; Li et al., 2005; Wang et al. 2005; Bai et al., 2007;   Park et al., 2007; Jiang et al., 2010; Park et al., 2013; Tara-  sov et al., 2017), the expression and function of ion chan-</p>

<p>nels in HUCPVCs have not been studied. Therefore, for </p>

<p>therapeutic applications, we need to investigate not only </p>

<p>the multi-lineage differentiation capacity, but also the elec-</p>

<p>trophysiological properties of K 
+ channels in HUCPVCs. </p>

<p>In the present study, we investigated the expression pa-</p>

<p>tterns of big-conductance Ca </p>

<p>2+ </p>

<p>-activated (BK Ca ) and vol-</p>

<p>tage-dependent K 
+ (K v ) channels in undifferentiated HUC-</p>

<p>PVCs and examined the effects of high glucose (HG, 25 </p>

<p>mM) on the expression levels of BK Ca and K v channels. </p>

<p>MATERIALS AND METHODS </p>

<p>1. Cell isolation and culture </p>

<p>HUC tissues (n = 3) were obtained from mothers under-</p>

<p>going Caesarian sections, with written informed consent </p>

<p>after approval by the Institutional Review Board of </p>

<p>Kangwon National University Hospital. The isolation and </p>

<p>culturing of HUCPVCs were performed as described pre-</p>

<p>viously (An et al., 2015a). Briefly, HUCs were rinsed with </p>

<p>sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) </p>

<p>and incised along their length in dishes. Both ends of the </p>

<p>isolated vessels were ligated with black silk and then trans-</p>

<p>ferred into 100 mm culture dishes containing α-minimal </p>

<p>essential media (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bo-</p>

<p>vine serum (FBS; Hyclone), 1% penicillin-streptomycin </p>

<p>(Sigma-Aldrich) and amphotericin B (0.3 µg/mL; Sigma-</p>

<p>Aldrich). After 7-10 days, the vessels were removed from </p>

<p>the dishes and the colonies were subcultured. Once the </p>

<p>cells reached 80% confluency, they were passaged by </p>

<p>treatment with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich). To </p>

<p>evaluate the effect of high glucose on the expression of ion </p>

<p>channels in PVCs, the cells were plated at a density of </p>

<p>4×10 
5 cells in 35 mm dishes and cultured in α-MEM me-</p>

<p>dium supplemented with low glucose (LG) (1.0 g/L, 5 mM) </p>

<p>and HG (4.5 g/L, 25 mM) for 5 days. </p>

<p>2. Flow cytometry analysis </p>

<p>HUCPVCs were dissociated into single cells using tryp-</p>

<p>sin-EDTA and resuspended in 1% FBS-PBS. The cells </p>

<p>were filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer and reacted </p>

<p>with the following antibodies conjugated with fluoro-</p>

<p>chrome for 1 hr at 4℃: CD31-phycoerythrin (PE), CD34-</p>

<p>fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC), CD45-allophycoeryth-</p>

<p>rin (APC), CD44-APC, CD90-APC, CD146-FITC, and </p>

<p>SSEA-4-FITC (all, BD Biosciences). The dead cells were </p>

<p>excluded with 7-aminoactinomycin D. Stained cells were </p>

<p>analyzed using the FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) and </p>

<p>data were analyzed by <rs id="software-0" type="software">FlowJo</rs> software (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">FlowJo</rs>). </p>

<p>3. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction </p>

<p>(RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR analysis </p>

<p>Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qi-</p>

<p>agen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, </p>

<p>total RNA was reverse transcribed by using the TOP-</p>

<p>script 
™ RT DryMIX kit (#RT200; Enzynomics). Trans-</p>

<p>cripts were quantitated using TOPreal 
™ qPCR 2X PreMIX </p>

<p>(#RT501S; Enzynomics) and the ABI StepOnePlus 
™ Sys-</p>

<p>tem Instrument (Applied Biosystems). The expression lev-</p>

<p>els of BK Ca and K v channel genes were normalized to </p>

<p>glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and </p>

<p>the relative quantification was performed using the com-</p>

<p>parative CT method according to the manufacturer's in-</p>

<p>structions (Applied Biosystems). The primer sequences are </p>

<p>listed in Table 1. </p>

<p>4. Data analysis </p>

<p>All results were expressed as mean±standard error of </p>

<p>mean (SEM). Student's t-test was used to determine statis-</p>

<p>We obtained PVCs from the vessels of HUC tissues us-</p>

<p>ing a non-enzymatic (NE) isolation method (An et al., </p>

<p>2015b). To prevent cross contamination with hemato-</p>

<p>poietic and endothelial cells, both ends of the vessel were </p>

<p>ligated and then plated into dishes. On days 7-10 post-</p>

<p>plating, PVC colonies were subcutured and successfully </p>

<p>expanded. HUCPVCs exhibited fibroblast or spindle-like </p>

<p>morphology (Fig. 1A). The phenotypic expression of </p>

<p>HUCPVCs (Passage 2) was analyzed by flow cytometry. </p>

<p>The cells were positive for CD146 (93%), SSEA-4 (10.1 </p>

<p>%), CD44 (99.9 %), and CD90 (99%), and negative for </p>

<p>CD31, CD45, and CD34, which precluded contamination </p>

<p>by endothelial and hematopoietic cells (Fig. 1B). These </p>

<p>results suggested that the NE method enabled us to obtain </p>

<p>a homogenous PVC population and that the expression </p>

<p>pattern of surface markers on HUCPVCs was in agreement </p>

<p>with that of human PVCs reported in previous studies. </p>

<p>2. High glucose treatment alters the expression of </p>

<p>BK Ca and Kv channels in undifferentiated HUCPVCs </p>

<p>We first investigated the expression patterns of BK Ca </p>

<p>and K v channel subtypes in undifferentiated HUCPVCs. </p>

<p>We found comparable mRNA expression of K Ca β 3a and </p>

<p>K v 1.3 subtypes in undifferentiated HUCPVCs (Fig. 2A and </p>

<p>2B). The expression levels of BK Ca 1.1, BK Ca 2.2, K Ca β, </p>

<p>K v 3.3, and K v 6.1 subtypes were relatively low (Fig. 2A </p>

<p>Fig. 1. Isolation and characterization of HUCPVCs. (A) Non-enzymatic isolation of HUCPVCs. Both ends of the dis-
sected vessel were ligated and plated into a 100 mm dish. Perivascular stem cell (PVC) colonies were collected

flow cytometry. PVC marker, CD146; MSC markers, CD44 and CD90; endothelial and hematopoietic markers,

<p>and 2B). High concentrations of glucose in the blood af-</p>

<p>fected the growth and functions of endogenous stem cells. </p>

<p>Thus, we next asked if high glucose influenced the expres-</p>

<p>sion levels of ion channels. HUCPVCs were plated at a </p>

<p>density of 4×10 
5 cells in 35 mm dishes and cultured in </p>

<p>both LG and HG conditions for 5 days. HG did not induce </p>

<p>morphological changes in HUCPVCs (Fig. 2C), but re-</p>

<p>duced the proliferative activity (data not shown). HG-</p>

<p>treated HUCPVCs showed increased mRNA levels of </p>

<p>BK Ca β 3a , BK Ca β 4 , K v 1.3, K v 1.6, and K v 6.1 subtypes. We </p>

<p>confirmed the upregulation of BK Ca β 4 , K v 1.6, and K v 6.1 </p>

<p>transcripts in HUCPVCs exposed to HG using quantitative </p>

<p>real-time PCR (Fig. 3). These results suggested that BK Ca </p>

<p>and K v channels may have unique functions in the growth </p>

<p>and differentiation of HUCPVCs, which could be affected </p>

<p>by HG exposure. </p>

<p>DISCUSSION </p>

<p>In the present study, we showed for the first time the ex-</p>

<p>pression patterns of BK Ca and K v ion channels in HUC-</p>

<p>PVCs, which could be altered by exposure to HG. In re-</p>

<p>cent years, PVCs have been suggested as a promising </p>

<p>source for cell-based therapy due to their greater regenera-</p>

<p>tive potential (Crisan et al., 2008). Ion channels are detect-</p>

<p>ed in a variety of cell types and play fundamental roles in </p>

<p>controlling cell proliferation and differentiation as well as </p>

<p>maintaining homeostasis (Kawano et al., 2002). Therefore, </p>

<p>we investigated the electrophysiological properties of HU-</p>

<p>CPVCs to improve their proliferative and regenerative </p>

<p>capacities. </p>

<p>Recent studies reported the electrophysiological proper-</p>

<p>ties of multipotent MSCs and found that the expression </p>

<p>patterns of ion channels were relatively heterogeneous </p>

<p>among MSCs. While similar expression levels of Kv1.4, </p>

<p>Kv4.1, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3 subtypes were observed between </p>

<p>adipose tissues (AD)-and bone marrow (BM)-derived </p>

<p>MSCs, expression of Kv1.1, Kv1.4, and Kv7.3 subtypes </p>

<p>varied across the tissues or among studies (Heubach et al., </p>

<p>2003; Li et al., 2005; Bai et al., 2007; Park et al., 2007; </p>

<p>Park et al., 2013). Bai et al. (2007) could not detect Kv4.1 </p>

<p>subtype in AD-MSCs. However, Park et al. (2013) report-</p>

<p>ed strong expression of Kv4.1 subtype in AD-MSCs. The </p>

<p>heterogeneity of Kv ion channels in MSCs may be at-</p>

<p>tributed to variations among donors or the tissues from </p>

<p>which MSCs are isolated. Our data showed different ex-</p>

<p>pression patterns of ion channel subtypes in PVCs com-</p>

<p>pared with AD-and BM-MSCs, indicating that PVCs are </p>

<p>different subpopulations and are more homogeneous than </p>

<p>MSCs. Culture conditions might also influence the expres-</p>

<p>sion of specific ion channel subtypes detected in MSCs. </p>

<p>For example, BM-MSCs cultured in HG medium exhibited </p>

<p>senescence and genetic instability by upregulation of au-</p>

<p>tophagy and oxidative stress (Chang et al., 2015). In addi-</p>

<p>tion, hyperglycemia impaired the proliferation and func-</p>

<p>tion of endogenous stem and somatic cells such as MSCs, </p>

<p>hematopoietic stem cells and Müller cells (Kim et al., 2015;   Kocabas et al., 2015; Manea et al., 2015; Hadarits et al.,   2016; Qiu et al., 2016). Thus, we assumed that the glucose </p>

<p>concentration in the culture medium may affect the expres-</p>

confirmation of upregulated subtypes in HG-treated HUCPVCs. Error bars indicate SEM. *p&lt;0.05. Other abbre-</p>

<p>sion levels of ion channels in PVCs and found increased </p>

<p>levels of BK Ca β 3a , BK Ca β 4 , K v 1.3, K v 1.6, and K v 6.1 trans-</p>

<p>cripts in HG-treated PVCs compared to those of LG-</p>

<p>treated PVCs. </p>

<p>In summary, this is the first characterization of ion </p>

<p>channels in HUCPVCs, which provides fundamental in-</p>

<p>formation to improve the regenerative capacity of HUC-</p>

<p>PVCs. Further study will be needed to define the physio-</p>

<p>logical roles of specific ion channels in the proliferation </p>

<p>and differentiation of HUCPVCs. </p>

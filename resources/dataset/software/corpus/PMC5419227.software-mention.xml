<p>Abstract </p>

<p>Background: Recent studies indicate an increased incidence of pertussis disease in recent years. The aim of 
this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the acellular vaccine for children (as a replacement of current whole 
cell vaccine in the Expanded Program on Immunization) and for high-risk adults in Iran through updating cur-
rent best available evidence. 
Methods: We performed a systematic literature review in relevant databases we focused on previously published 
systematic reviews to select those that address our questions. The <rs type="software">AMSTAR</rs> (assessing the methodological quality of 
systematic reviews) tool was used for screening available reviews. Then search in databases was done until Feb 2014 
to update the evidence. We pooled results using meta-analysis methods by <rs type="software">Stata statistical package</rs>. 
Results: Eleven systematic review articles were included in the initial evaluation. In the end, two systematic 
reviews on acellular vaccine booster doses and the acellular vaccine in children were selected as the baseline 
evidence. In the update phase, new clinical trials were screened, and the results were updated. Overall pooled 
estimate of relative efficacy of acellular to whole cell was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.55-0.81) for children immunization 
Pooled estimates for the efficacy of acellular versus placebo were 0.70 (95% CI, 0.60-0.80). Overall pooled 
estimate of efficacy of booster dose of acellular was 0.87(95% CI, 0.85-0.88) compared to placebo. In addition 
pooled estimate of acellular vaccine efficacy based on response to antigen was 0.78(95% CI, 0.64-0.93) in high-
risk group. 
Conclusion: The results show higher performance and safety of the acellular vaccine in the prevention of pertus-
sis in children versus the whole cell vaccine. Moreover, the efficacy of the acellular vaccine in high-risk adult 
groups is acceptable. This study provides evidence in favor of the introduction of an acellular vaccine to the na-
tional program of immunization. Studies on cost effectiveness and aspects of policy analysis are recommended. </p>

<p>Introduction 
Whooping cough is an acute bacterial 
respiratory disease, caused by Bordetella </p>

<p>pertussis. It can be transmitted through na-
sal and pharyngeal discharges. This disease 
has a high degree of virulence. Also the </p>

<p>bacteria has a high attack rate (80-100%) 
(1). Immunization against whooping cough 
is widely coverage by whole-cell vaccine 
which was developed in the 1940s (2). 
Most of the whole-cell vaccines are mixed 
with Diphtheria and Tetanus toxoids, unde-
sired chemicals like endotoxins which are 
side products of whole cell vaccines cause 
side effects for this kind of vaccines. Due 
to growing concerns about the neurologic 
disorders related to whole-cell vaccines, 
Acellular vaccines were produced and test-
ed in 1970 and were used in 1980 in Japan 
(3,4). Increasing in the incidence of pertus-
sis in adolescents suggesting that the im-
munity by the acellular vaccine may be 
more efficient than whole-cell vaccine (5), 
although according to the technical adviso-
ry group on vaccine-preventable diseases 
(TAG), countries that are using whole-cell 
vaccine should not switch to an acellular 
vaccine. Similarly, countries currently us-
ing acellular should not switch back to the 
use of whole-cell until more evidence is 
available to support changes in vaccination 
strategies for pertussis (5). In Iran, in spite 
of vaccination program covering more than 
90% of the population, reports show an in-
creasing trend of incidence rate in some 
years which may be due to lack of control 
in adults (6). This study was designed and 
performed in order to reach the best estima-
tion of vaccine efficacy and also as an in-
troduction to cost-effectiveness analysis of 
acellular vaccination in Iran for providing 
strong evidence for health policy makers. </p>

<p>Methods 
We tried to systematically answer three 
questions in this study: 
What is the relative efficacy of acellular 
pertussis vaccine compared to the whole 
cell vaccine in children of fewer than five 
years old? 
What is the efficacy of an additional 
booster dose of acellular pertussis vaccine 
compared to placebo in fully immunized 
children with whole cell pertussis? 
What is the efficacy of a booster dose of 
acellular pertussis vaccine compared to </p>

<p>placebo in high-risk adults (healthcare staff 
and pregnant women)? 
First, we performed a systematic review 
on review studies of acellular vaccine effi-
cacy in: 1. children, 2. Health care worker, 
3. pregnant women and 4. Booster dose of 
acellular pertussis vaccine. We selected a 
core systematic review for each of the 
above-mentioned 
groups, 
considering 
quality factors of AMSTAR (assessing the 
methodological quality of systematic re-
views) and publication time of the review. 
Then we performed a systematic review of 
clinical trials of the acellular vaccine in or-
der to update core reviews. </p>

<p>Search strategy 
In order to retrieve related studies we 
used Pertussis Vaccine/ Whooping Cough/ 
whoop/ Bordetella pertussis/ Vaccines, 
Acellular/ Meta-analysis/ review/ systemat-
ic review 
Keywords in relevant evidence base med-
icine database via Ovid S.P. 
To arrange the search strategy, since there 
was a related systematic review in 
Cochrane (8) we used a searching method 
in this review as a guidance to develop a 
final search strategy. For the secondary 
studies in MEDLINE, we used CRD which 
is a very precise strategy (9). Also, we used 
Cochrane recommended methods of sys-
tematic searching (10). Also, we used 
PUBMED recommended strategy for sys-
tematic review and for the secondary stud-
ies in another database. We used Lee et al. 
method (11-13). Search in databases was 
done in August 2012 by a clinical librarian 
(FSH) and we did not limit our search to a 
certain language or time period. </p>

<p>Search resources 
We conducted a search strategy in Med-
line via Ovid, EMBASE via Ovid, EBM 
Reviews via Ovid, CINAHL and PUBMED 
via EBSCOhost. Other references such as 
CEA Registry, Pediatric Economic Data-
base Evaluation, EURONHEEDs and 
Google Scholar were used for covering 
gray literature and to increase the sensitivi-</p>

<p>ty of the search. We did a manual reference 
checking and citation tracking of related 
papers. In every step of searching, we were 
considered PRISMA statement (14). First, 
as our objective was finding relevant sys-
tematic reviews and updating them, we up-
dated our search in February 2013, in case 
to recheck are the references of the system-
atic reviews which have been chosen as 
core review. For updating the research we 
used Cochrane updating protocol. We used 
a combination of the following words in the 
updating step of our research: 
Pertussis Vaccine/ Whooping Cough/ 
Bordetella pertussis/ Vaccines, Acellular/ 
("Quantitative Studies"/ ("Placebos") ran-
dom* or AB random* (single* blind* or 
double* blind* or triple* blind* or treble* 
blind* or single* mask* or double* mask* 
or triple* mask* or treble* mask*) or AB 
(single* blind* or double*) 
The following references have been used 
in the updating step: Biological Abstracts, 
EBM Reviews -Cochrane Central Register 
of Controlled Trials &lt;January 2014&gt;, CI-
NAHL with Full Text, EMBASE&lt;1974 to 
2014 February 06&gt;, Ovid MEDLINE(R) 
In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations 
and Ovid MEDLINE(R) &lt;1946 to Pre-
sent&gt;. </p>

<p>Inclusion criteria 
In the first phase of screening, all of the 
systematic reviews with or without meta-
analysis were included. In the updating 
phase all the RCTs (randomized clinical 
trial), quasi-RCTs and immunogenicity 
studies were included. The study popula-
tion included children less than 6 years old 
from the general population, adolescent and 
high-risk groups including pregnant women 
and health care workers. The interventions 
were evaluated with four different analyti-
cal strategies. The first strategy was as-
sessing acellular vaccine for children com-
pared to placebo, the second strategy was 
assessing acellular vaccine for children 
compared to whole cell vaccine, the third 
one was assessing the booster dose of acel-
lular vaccine (booster vaccination after 10 </p>

<p>years) compared to no-booster and the 
fourth one was acellular vaccine to the 
high-risk group compared to placebo or un-
related vaccines. </p>

<p>Exclusion criteria 
Laboratory studies conducted on animals 
were excluded. Also, studies using non-
standardized methods were excluded from 
this study. </p>

<p>Study selection 
Full-texts of the relevant studies were 
critically appraised for eligibility criteria by 
two researchers independently (MY and 
SSH). Flow diagram of articles included in 
the systematic review is shown in (Fig. 1). </p>

<p>Outcome Assessment 
The primary outcome was the clinical ef-
ficacy of the vaccine to prevent disease 
during the follow-up period, and the sec-
ondary outcome was the immunity in that 
period. Disease had been defined in two 
different ways in clinical trials. Based on 
the first definition whooping cough is a 
disease with 21 days long lasting continues 
coughs by Bordetella pertussis which has 
been proved with positive cell culture, posi-
tive serological tests or having contact with 
a known case of disease which had been 
proved with two positive cultures (WHO 
1991). In the other definition, the disease is 
having 7 days of continues coughs with a 
positive cell culture or serologic test (8). </p>

<p>Data extraction 
Data extraction was carried out by two re-
searchers (MY, SSH). Year of publication, 
year of study, location of study, study de-
sign, number of patients in the study, num-
ber of patients in each group, age range and 
type of vaccine synchronizing with other 
vaccines administered, duration of follow-
up, number of doses and study phase were 
extracted., Outcome indicators such as rela-
tive risk, odds ratio, and response rates 
(percent) to the antigen for high-risk group 
were extracted from the studies as well. </p>

<p>Quality assessment 
The systematic review studies were as-
sessed with <rs type="software">AMSTAR</rs> (A program that as-
sesses the quality of the articles in 11 dif-
ferent areas.), and the clinical trials were 
assessed with CASP (<rs type="software">Critical Appraisal 
Skills Programme (CASP) tool</rs>) (15,16). </p>

<p>Data Synthesis 
The statistical analyses were done via 
<rs id="software-5" type="software">STATA</rs> <rs corresp="#software-5" type="version-number">version 11</rs>. Indicators for assessing 
the clinical trials were risk ratio (RR) or 
odds ratio (OR). For the high-risk group, 
we did not find enough studies to assess 
clinical outcomes through RR or OR, so, 
we assessed the vaccine immunogenicity 
and analysis was performed on the response 
rate to the antigen. For calculating the vac-
cine efficacy, we used RR-1 formula (17). 
Moreover, publication biases of the studies 
were assessed via Funnel-plot with regres-</p>

<p>sion asymmetry test (Egger's test). Hetero-
geneity of the studies was assessed with 
Cochrane Q-test. All pooled estimates were 
calculated by random effect model (except 
the cases of no significant heterogeneity). 
Subgroups were determined based on four 
strategies for the vaccination program. </p>

<p>Results 
Study selection 
The electronic searching identified 1026 
abstract from databases. After the initial 
screening of title/abstract by two research-
ers (MY, SSH), 853 abstracts were exclud-
ed from the analysis and a total of 173 stud-
ies were selected for further investigation 
and extracting data from full texts. Finally, 
11 review studies (8,18-26) in the initial 
evaluation were criticized with the AM-
STAR tool by three researchers (MY, SSH, 
MML) (Table 1). Finally, we selected ---</p>

<p>systematic reviews to be used as a base 
(core systematic review) for answering 
each of the four questions of this study: the 
Zhang et al. (9) review article (2012) for 
acellular vaccine in children, the Rodriguez 
et al. (19) review article for booster vaccine 
were obtained as core reviews for analyzing 
data about vaccine safety and efficacy. We 
updated these reviews through our protocol 
for finding new clinical trials through a sys-
tematic review. We classified new trials in 
the four subgroups; then Meta-analyses 
were performed to create pooled estimates 
for vaccine efficacy. In the updating phase, 
clinical trial studies were screened, and a 
total of 2 clinical studies out of 20 studies 
were added to the core systematic review 
(32,33). Finally, we obtained 15 studies </p>

<p>(27-42) from core systematic reviews and 
clinical trials extracted from updating 
phase, among them we included 7 interven-
tions for the efficacy of acellular vaccine 
versus placebo, 6 interventions for the effi-
cacy of acellular vaccine versus whole cell, 
7 interventions for the efficacy of acellular 
vaccine booster dose (Table 2). In addition, 
two review articles were analyzed for as-
sessing the vaccine efficacy in the high-risk 
group as an immunological response in 
pregnant women and health workers 
(42,43). </p>

<p>Acellular pertussis vaccine efficacyâ€¦ </p>

<p>Discussion 
Results of the current review in order to 
estimate the pooled estimate of efficacy of 
acellular whooping cough vaccine when 
used with multiple strategies as vaccination 
of children and booster doses for adults and 
high-risk groups (pregnant women and 
health care worker), illustrates that applica-
tion of acellular vaccine in children reduces 
the incidence of disease by 60-80%. The 
estimated efficacy compared with whole-
cell vaccine is 55-81%. Efficacy of acellu-
lar vaccine in booster doses in adults avert-
ed disease in this age group by 85-88%. In 
high-risk groups after investigating the 
immune response, the cases averted has 
been estimated 64-93% in a random model. 
A review study conducted with Cochrane 
by Zhang et al. (8) in 2012 in order to de-
termine the efficacy and safety of acellular 
vaccine in children less than 6 years old. In 
that review study, the efficacy of the vac-
cine was shown in 6 clinical trials designed 
for the defined consequences. Efficacy of 
vaccines with more than 3 particles to pre-
vent typical whooping cough disease is 84-
85% and efficacy to prevent mild whooping 
cough disease is 71-78%. In the current 
study according to the updates performed, 
pooled estimate of efficacy of the acellular 
vaccine was 71-77%. 
Vaccine safety is one of the first issues in 
this field that is studied in Zhang's review 
article, and because of that, we didn't dis-
cuss it in the present study. In the men-
tioned review study, major and minor side 
effects were studied in 52 clinical trials in 
136541 children and cumulative efficacy of 
the acellular and whole-cell vaccines were 
compared in various doses. Study indicated 
that risk ratio (RR) of major side effects as 
death, encephalopathy, seizures and hypo-</p>

<p>tonic posture in the first dose of acellular 
vaccine compared to the whole cell vaccine 
were 0.97 , 0.00 , 0.47 , 0.26 respectively 
and risk ratio in minor side effects like ano-
rexia, prolong crying and high fever were 
estimated 0.43, 0.17, 0.15 respectively. 
These numbers increased slightly in the 
next doses (8). Assessing acellular vaccine 
was considered because of fewer side ef-
fects than whole cell vaccine, especially 
neurologic side effects. On the other hand, 
the limitations of using whole cell vaccine 
in adults as well as not making a lifetime 
security by using whole cell vaccine in 
children causing poor control of the dis-
ease, incidence of disease in adults and 
transmission of it to other groups in a socie-
ty are known. There are studies in this field 
, for example, Pertussis incidence rates in 
two decades in the United States has in-
creased steadily while during the process 
that vaccination rates among children were 
high. During the years 1997 to 2000, most 
of the cases, according to the Center for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
were infants (55.5%) and patients of 10 to 
19 years old (29%). But in 2005, 60% of 
the reported cases were among adolescents 
of 10 to 18 years old (46) from the reasons 
of increasing in this disease reports, up-
grade of diagnostic procedures and increase 
awareness about the disease was noted. 
However, many studies have shown that 
immunity after vaccination decreases over 
time and protection may only be 10 to 15 
years which this can increase the number of 
susceptible individuals among adolescents 
and adults. The study conducted by Nikbin 
et al. (6) in the ministry of health in Iran 
indicated that the number of susceptible 
and diagnosed whooping cough patients is 
recently increasing. The reasons for this </p>

<p>increase in the article were the same as we 
mentioned here. It has been described that 
most cases have been confirmed among 
children due to the less attention of the dis-
ease among adults. In a review study by 
Rodriguez (19) in 2012, the clinical effica-
cy of direct and indirect (herd immunity) of 
vaccine booster dose with different strate-
gies was evaluated and calculated. Twenty 
one observational studies entered into the 
analysis and were estimated using mathe-
matical modeling. Direct result of the vac-
cination (reduction of the incidence was 37-
64% in adolescents and 39-50% in adults 
vaccinated) was estimated, and indirect ef-
fects or community immunity (18-22% re-
duction in the incidence of disease in ado-
lescents and 33% in adults) was calculated. 
Highlights from a study conducted by Ro-
driguez, is computing the community im-
munity, which is an explanation for the ep-
idemiologic process change and the use of 
booster doses (19). 
Control of disease in high-risk groups 
such as pregnant women to maintain safety 
in infants and employees of the health sys-
tem as a factor for infection and transmis-
sion also had been considered. This point 
makes us remember the importance of 
booster dose in adults. In most cases, the 
disease incidence in adults is directly relat-
ed to epidemiology in health care workers 
(21,22) .In a study conducted by Wright et 
al. in 1992 among emergency room staff, a 
serological survey showed that despite high 
immunization coverage in children, anti-
body levels were low in the majority of 
employees. This caused this group to be at 
high risk for infection and subsequent 
transmission of pertussis to susceptible in-
dividuals. The incidence of Bordetella per-
tussis among health professionals was 3.1% 
at 95% confidence level (CI) (5.3%-0.00) 
among 106 physicians, 6.3% at 95% CI 
(6.9%-0.00) among the physicians and 
nurses of emergency department (19). 
On the positive side, this review performs 
an integrate search of the information and 
estimates the pooled efficacy rates and 
compiles different kinds of strategies. To </p>

<p>conclude, to demonstrate the efficacy and 
safety of acellular vaccines, considering the 
widespread use of vaccines in children with 
higher safety and booster doses among 
adults especially high-risk groups to pro-
mote safety in this group to eliminate or 
reduce the transmission cycle is recom-
mended. In addition, performing cost-
effectiveness analysis for implementing 
acellular vaccine in national immunization 
program in Iran seems necessary. </p>

<p>with GJB1 mutations. Their clinical records and laboratory findings were retrospectively 
collected and reviewed. Mutations in the GJB1 gene were analyzed by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). Nucleotide alternations

Results: The CMT1X patients predominantly showed distal muscle weakness of lower limbs with mild sensory disturbance. The mean age 
of onset was 15.6 ± 8.7 years (ranging from 1 year to 42 years). The sudden onset of cerebral symptoms appeared in four patients (18.2%); 
two were initial symptoms. One case had constant central nervous system (CNS) signs. There were 19 different heterozygous mutations, 
including 15 known mutations and four novel mutations (c.115G&gt;T, c.380T&gt;A, c.263C&gt;A, and c.818_819insGGGCT). Among the 
22 Chinese patients with CMT1X, the frequency of the GJB1 mutation was 4.5% in transmembrane domain 1 (TM1), 4.5% in TM2, 
22.7% in TM3, 9.1% in TM4, 4.5% in extracellular 1 (EC1), 27.3% in EC2, 9.1% in intracellular loop, 13.6% in the N-terminal domain, 
and 4.5% in the C-terminal domain. CMT1X with CNS impairment appeared in five (22.7%) of these patients. 
Conclusions: This study indicated that CNS impairment was not rare in Chinese CMT1X patients. Mutations in the EC2 domain of the 
GJB1 gene were hotspot in Chinese CMT1X patients. </p>

Patients </p>

<p>Ninety-two patients with CMT from unrelated families 
were diagnosed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) at the 
Department of Neurology, Peking University First Hospital 
from January 2005 to January 2016. Among them, a total 
of 22 patients with GJB1 mutations were recruited in this 
study, which comprised 23.9% of the total CMT patients. 
As for the other CMT genes, the mutation frequency was 
35.9% in peripheral myelin protein 22 gene, 17.4% in 
mitofusin 2 gene, 2.2% in myelin protein zero gene, 5.4% in 
inverted formin, FH2 and WH2 domain containing (INF2) 
gene, 4.3% in ganglioside-induced differentiation associated 
protein 1 gene, 2.2% in neurofilament light gene, 2.2% in 
periaxin gene, 1.1% in SH3 domain and tetratricopeptide 
repeats 2 gene, 1.1% in early growth response 2 gene, 
1.1% in glycyl-tRNA synthetase gene, 1.1% in leucine rich 
repeat and sterile alpha motif containing 1 gene, 1.1% in 
FIG4 phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase (FIG4) gene, 1.1% in 
alanyl-tRNA synthetase gene, and 1.1% in dehydrogenase 
E1 and transketolase domain containing 1 gene. </p>

<p>The clinical records and electrophysiological characteristics 
of these 22 CMT1X patients with GJB1 mutations were 
retrospectively collected and reviewed. Muscle weakness 
was evaluated using the Medical Research Council score. All 
patients were interviewed and examined by two neurologists. </p>

<p>Mutation analysis </p>

<p>Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood 
samples of all patients. Mutations in the GJB1 gene were 
analyzed by targeted NGS. NGS panel covered all of the exons 
and their flanking sequences of genes known to be associated 
with hereditary neuropathies (gene list available on request). 
The exons and their flanking splice sites were captured 
and subsequently sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 
Sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The sequencing 
files were mapped to reference sequences with Burrows-
Wheeler Aligner and Picard tools and then called with control 
samples with the <rs id="software-0" type="software">GATK</rs> <rs corresp="#software-0" type="version-number">3.0</rs> HaplotypeCaller (<rs corresp="#software-0" type="creator">Broad Institute</rs>, 
USA). Nucleotide alternations were confirmed with Sanger 
sequencing. The segregation analyses of the mutations were 
confirmed in the parents and the affected family members. For 
the novel mutations, 1000 healthy controls of Chinese origin 
were screened. The biological relevance of the novel amino 
acid changes was studied using both <rs id="software-1" type="software">PolyPhen</rs>-<rs corresp="#software-1" type="version-number">2</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-1" type="url">http://www.genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2</rs>/) and <rs id="software-2" type="software">Mutation Taster</rs> (<rs corresp="#software-2" type="url">http://www.mutationtaster.org</rs>/) programs. </p>

<p>Patients' clinical and electrophysiological characteristics </p>

<p>These 22 patients came from unrelated families, including 
20 males and 2 females. The clinical and electrophysiological 
characteristics of these CMT1X patients are shown in 
Table 1. The mean age of onset was 15.6 ± 8.7 years (ranging 
from 1 year to 42 years). Fifteen (68.2%) patients exhibited 
first symptoms in their second decade. Five (22.7%) of them 
presented symptoms after 20 years old. Two patients (9.1%) </p>

<p>had an earlier onset before 10 years old, including one from 
infancy. The mean duration from onset to diagnostic time 
was 8.2 ± 4.5 years (ranging from 2 years to 18 years). </p>

<p>All patients showed distal muscle wasting and weakness of 
the lower limbs, with the involvement of the upper limbs 
in 13 cases. Muscle strength ranged from III to V in distal 
upper limbs and from 0 to V in distal lower limbs. Sensory 
loss in distal limbs appeared in eight cases. Pes cavus 
occurred in 16 cases. CNS involvement appeared in five 
patients (22.7%), including four cases with transient CNS 
symptoms and one case with constant CNS signs. Four cases 
(18.2%) with transient symptoms presented with sudden 
onset of cerebral symptoms including aphasia, dysphagia, 
quadriplegia, or paralysis induced by fever or infection. 
The symptoms usually lasted from hours to days, and the 
patients completely recovered without special treatment. 
CNS symptoms in two patients appeared initially before 
the development of peripheral neuropathy. One case with 
constant CNS involvement additionally presented with 
nystagmus and ataxia on physical examination. </p>

<p>In median nerves, the mean motor nerve conduction 
velocity (MCV) was 35.0 ± 4.8 m/s (range: 27.3-43.9 m/s), 
the mean amplitude of compound muscle action 
potential (CAMP) was 2.3 ± 1.5 mV (range: 0.2-5.2 mV), 
the mean sensory nerve conduction velocity (SCV) was 
42.0 ± 9.6 m/s (range: 32.1-66.0 m/s), and the mean sensory 
nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitude was 5.0 ± 4.2 mV 
(range: 1.4-12.1 mV). In ulnar nerves, the mean MCV was 
33.6 ± 5.7 m/s (range: 27.7-46.7 m/s), the mean CAMP 
amplitude was 3.7 ± 3.2 mV (range: 0.3-10.3 mV), the 
mean SCV was 40.4 ± 12.8 m/s (range: 30.3-71.0 m/s), 
and the SNAP mean amplitude was 3.3 ± 3.3 mV (ranging 
from −1.47 mV to 9.6 mV). In tibial nerves, the mean MCV 
was 32.5 ± 5.5 m/s (range: 23.0-39.2 m/s) and the mean 
CAMP amplitude was 1.1 ± 1.7 mV (range: 0.0-4.8 mV). </p>

<p>The cranial magnetic resonance imagings (MRIs) of patient 
2 revealed abnormal signals in the splenium and genu of 
the corpus callosum in the first episode and in the bilateral 
posterior limbs of the internal capsule and splenium of the 
corpus callosum in the second episode. The cranial MRIs of 
patient 3 revealed abnormal signals in the centrum semiovale 
bilaterally in the first episode, the signals enlarged at the 
same location in the second episode, and widened at the third 
episode; the abnormal signals were resolved at intervals. The 
cranial MRIs of patient 4 revealed abnormal signals in the 
posterior limb of the internal capsule and the periventricular 
area bilaterally. The MRIs of patient 13 revealed abnormal 
signals in the bilateral centrum semiovale and splenium of 
the corpus callosum [Figure 1]. </p>

<p>because 23.9% of all 92 CMT families were CMT1X. 
This study observed that the proportion of CMT1X in 
Chinese population was greater than other reports. The 
proportion of CMT1X patients for all CMTs was 10.7% in 
Europe (n = 997), 
[21] 15.2% in the USA (n = 527), 
[22] 12.0% in 
Australia (n = 224), 
[23] and 10.9% in Japan (n = 128). 
[24] In a 
study of multi-ethnic Malaysian patients with CMTs (n = 25), 
CMT1X patients were all Chinese and accounted for 24% 
of the total CMT patients. </p>

<p>[25] </p>

<p>In this study, all CMT1X patients showed distal muscle 
weakness predominantly in the lower limbs with a mean 
onset age of 15.6 ± 8.7 years, similar to other reports. </p>

<p>[22] </p>

<p>Most patients began presenting their symptoms in their 
second or third decade. Patients with an earlier onset before 
10 years old or in infancy were rare in the present study and 
other reports. 
[22,26,27] Electrophysiological findings of our 
patients further confirmed that CMT1X is an intermediate 
neuropathy. </p>

<p>Several types of hereditary neuropathies were associated with 
other organ involvement, such as distal motor neuropathy 
with optic atrophy, 
[28] hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis 
with cardiomyopathy, 
[29] and dominant inherited intermediate 
CMT with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. 
[30] This 
study confirmed that CNS involvement was common in 
Chinese CMT1X. Dysarthria and hemiparesis were the 
main symptoms of our patients, and other similar symptoms 
have been occasionally reported in other countries. </p>

<p>[31-36] </p>

<p>CNS symptoms developed after peripheral neuropathy 
symptoms in some patients in the present study, which has 
also been reported in previous studies. 
[32,36] Brain MRIs 
showed abnormal transient lesions involving bilateral 
white matter in all patients. However, the involvement of 
the corpus callosum which was frequently reported did not 
appear in all cases in the present study. 
[34,37] The isolated 
involvement of the centrum semiovale, internal capsule, and 
the periventricular area appeared in the present study as well 
as in other reports. </p>

<p>[38,39] </p>

<p>We found that the EC2 domain of Cx32 protein was more 
affected in our patients. The EC2 domain was a hotspot 
mutation domain and was affected in 44% of Korean 
patients, 
[40] which was more frequent compared to our 
patients. Mutations in the EC1 and EC2 domains of Cx32 
were in 65% of the patients with Spanish or Portuguese </p>

<p>descent. 
[41] However, EC1 and EC2 were not hotspot 
mutation domains in Japanese 
[24] and Malaysian 
[25] patients. 
We found no relationship between the position of mutations 
and CNS involvement in CMT1X. In the present series, 
mutations of five patients with CNS involvement were 
located in the N-terminal, TM1, and TM3 domains of 
GJB1 gene. The c.425G&gt;A mutation was found in patients 
with pure peripheral neuropathy as well as in patients with 
additional CNS involvement. Four novel mutations in GJB1 
gene were found in our cohort, which expands the spectrum 
of mutations in CMT1X. </p>

<p>In summary, CNS impairment was not rare in Chinese 
CMT1X patients. The CMT1X diagnosis should be considered 
in children with transient CNS impairment with or without any 
signs of peripheral neuropathy. Mutations in the EC2 domain 
of the GJB1 gene were hotspot in Chinese CMT1X patients. </p>

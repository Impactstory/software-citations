            <p>Our results with rbf &#57394;/&#57394; cells indicate that some level of E2F activator, not simply E2F derepression, is required to bypass cell cycle exit upon terminal differentiation. This requirement is specific to the forced proliferation of terminally differentiating cells, as cells lacking all E2F-DP activity can proliferate during normal development <ref type="bibr">(Frolov et al., 2001, 2003, 2005)</ref>. This suggests that certain critical E2F targets may require the activator function of E2F for expression in differentiating cells. Therefore, we chose to compare gene expression changes caused by high E2F activity to those caused by the loss of all E2F-DP function in terminally differentiating cells.. E2F transcriptional activation and Dp loss are highly similar, except for specific genes that require E2F activity for expression after exit. Using microarrays, we compared gene expression in E2F1-DP-expressing wings (ap-Gal4/UAS-E2F1, UAS-DP, tub-Gal80 TS ) with controls (ap-Gal4/UAS, tub-Gal80 TS ) and Dp mutant wings (w;Dp a1/a2 ) with controls (w) at three time points. (A) Heat map of transcript changes (color range indicates the log 2 ratio of expression compared with controls). All transcripts with a fold change of 1.5 or more (&gt;log 2 &#177; 0.6) at one or more time points are shown. Gray bars indicate transcripts that were removed from analysis because of high variability among independently replicated experiments (n = 4 for E2F; n = 3 for Dp &#57394;/&#57394; ). Transcripts were clustered using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="c212845b5e-software-simple-0">Genesis</rs> software for hierarchical clustering. Representative genes from each major cluster are listed on the right. Typical group transcripts are up-regulated in E2F-expressing and Dp &#57394;/&#57394; wings at 24 and 36 h APF, whereas other transcripts are repressed or inversely regulated. Arrays for E2F and Dp &#57394;/&#57394; at 24 and 36 h were highly similar with a correlation coefficient of 0.74. (B) A group of 162 genes was up-regulated &gt;1.75-fold (&gt;log 2 0.82) by E2F activity at one or both time points APF but was not significantly increased in Dp</p>
            <p>We hypothesized that high APC/C activity after exit could limit E2F-induced bypass of cell cycle exit by degrading key E2F targets. This is consistent with our finding that E2F1-DPoverexpressing cells do not accumulate the known APC/C targets CycA, Geminin (Gem; <ref type="bibr">Zielke et al., 2008)</ref>, CycB, or Stg (based on a Stg-GFP fusion protein) after prolonged exit in wings or eyes (40-44 h APF; <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>, A, C, E, and G; and <ref type="figure">Fig. S3)</ref>, despite expressing high levels of cycA, gem, stg, and cycB transcripts by microarray (see supplemental dataset and <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="c212845b5e-software-simple-1">JCB DataViewer</rs>). In contrast, cells expressing E2F + Rca1 together accumulated CycA in wings <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6 B)</ref>, Stg-GFP in eyes <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6 D)</ref>, Gem in eyes <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6 H)</ref>, and very low levels of CycB in wings and eyes <ref type="figure">Fig. 6 F and Fig. S3)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Pupae, staged from white prepupae (0 h) at 25&#176;C, were dissected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1&#215; PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Pupal cuticle was removed from wings after fixation. Tissues 24-36 h APF were blocked in PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 + 1% BSA for 1 h. Tissues 36-44 h APF were blocked in PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100 + 1% BSA (PAT) overnight. For stages after 44 h APF, we incorporated a methanol dehydration series after fixation (25, 50, 75, and 100% methanol/1&#215; PBS, 10 min each) that allowed improved antibody penetration, increased sensitivity, and BrdU detection for tissues 44-60 h APF. After step-wise rehydration, tissues were blocked in PAT overnight, and antibody staining or BrdU incorporation was performed as described previously <ref type="bibr">(Buttitta et al., 2007; Zielke et al., 2008)</ref> using Alexa Fluor 488-, Alexa Fluor 568-or Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated secondary antibodies and Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Wing hinge and notum as well as head capsule and antenna were excluded from our analyses. 1 &#181;g/ml Hoechst 33258 (Invitrogen) was used to label nuclei. Confocal sections and differential interference contrast images were collected on a microscope (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) using a 25&#215; objective. Single representative sections (2.2 &#181;m) are shown, except for <ref type="figure">Fig. 3 (E and F)</ref>, which are projections of eight sections at a 1-&#181;m interval. Images were cropped using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="c212845b5e-software-9">Photoshop</rs> (<rs corresp="#c212845b5e-software-9" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Adobe</rs>). Mitotic index was calculated as the mean number of PH3-positive cells/100 GFP-positive cells among multiple clones in several samples, counted blind, from at least two independent experiments.</p>
            <p>Online supplemental material <ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref> shows that bypass of cell cycle exit is limited, even in the absence of all E2F-DP function. <ref type="figure">Fig. S2</ref> shows GFP-labeled clones expressing the indicated cell cycle regulators generated using hs-FLP tub&gt;Gal4/ UAS, tub-Gal80 TS . <ref type="figure">Fig. S3</ref> shows GFP-marked clones expressing the indicated cell cycle regulators generated using hs-FLP tub&gt;Gal4/UAS, tub-Gal80 TS and examined for CycB or Gem.

Complete microarray clusters are also available for viewing on the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="c212845b5e-software-simple-4">JCB DataViewer</rs>.

Continuous variables were expressed as meanAESD and analyzed by unpaired t tests, with Welch adjustment when necessary. Continuous variables that violated the normality assumption were expressed as median and 25th to 75th percentiles and analyzed by a Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were expressed as absolute (n) and relative (%) frequency and were analyzed by the Pearson 2-test or the Fisher exact test whenever appropriate. Significant level was considered with P&lt;0.05. Univariate analysis was carried out for patient data, and multivariate analysis by logistic regression was used to obtain data about the risk factors for AKI at the 3 time points: preoperative, ICU admittance, and 24 hours after ICU admittance. In the multivariate analysis, results were expressed by the odds ratio and the 95% confidence interval. The regression b of those variables obtained from logistic regression were used to develop the final 3 stage scores to predict CSA-AKI. The 1152 patients in the validation cohort were scored for validation, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) as well as Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test were applied to estimate the reliability of the scoring for predicting CSA-AKI.</p>

Alternatively, these steps can be performed by the instructor outside of the class and the taxonomic classification and relative abundance data can be used in class. Many of the academic and commercial sequencing facilities will perform filtering and basic analysis of the raw sequence data.

            <p>Almost half of the IGs and more than half of the genes significantly change their expression level in the Crp(&#192;) mutant relative to the wild-type during the transition from aerobic to anaerobic growth To identify IGs and genes with significant changes in gene expression the statistical analysis of the data was implemented as a two class unpaired experiment, with one class referring to the Crp(&#192;) mutant and the other to the wild-type strain of MR1. Biological replicates and time points were combined because of the high pair-wise correlation between them (87-99%) across genes and IGs within either the wild-type or Crp(&#192;) mutant expression profiles (Supplementary Data 1). Stanford <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="ec62815cfc-software-simple-0">Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM)</rs> software (53) was used for the analysis with the recommended parameters and a threshold for false discovery rate of 0.06%. Results of the analysis (Supplementary Data 2) revealed that almost half of the IGs and more than half of the genes significantly changed, either decreased or increased, the level of their expression in the Crp(&#192;) mutant relative to the wild-type. The percentage of IGs yielding significantly decreased expression was about the same (28%) as the percentage of genes that were repressed (31%). About 15% of IGs and 21% of genes had a significantly increased level of expression. Thus, a change in the growth condition in combination with the knockout of Crp, a regulator of the MR1 response to the change, induced significant transcriptional reprogramming of not only genes, but also of IGs in the MR1 genome.</p>

            <p>We conducted a survey of 277 patients who scored over 13 on the Glasgow coma scale who received treatment at our institution after minor head trauma in the period from January 2012 to December 2013. Patients were enrolled prospectively and their medical records were reviewed retrospectively. All the patients did not require surgery at the time of their arrival. During the follow-up period, the 20 patients who required surgery to treat CSDH were designated as the patient group, while the remaining 257 patients who did not develop CSDH after minor head trauma and completed treatment were selected as the control group. Head trauma, out of many other factors, was set as the controlled variable. Age, gender, and the history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, cerebral infarction, cardiac disease, hematologic disease, and epilepsy were investigated as the factors contributing to progression of CSDH after minor trauma. The medication history of antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents was also surveyed, as well as the smoking and drinking habits of subjects. The presence of acute subdural hematoma (AS-DH) in the convexity, accompanying hemorrhage and encephalomalacia, and the maximum distance from skull to cerebral parenchyma <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) were investigated by examining the patients' initial computerized tomography (CT) scans. In our study, cardiac disease included valve disease, arrhythmia, and ischemic heart disease. The diseases that could cause coagulopathy, such as hematological malignancies, were defined as hematologic disease. In cases where the patients' initial brain CT scans showed cerebral contusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage, epidural hemorrhage, or intracerebral hemorrhage, we defined the finding as an accompanying hemorrhage. The statistical analysis was performed using Window <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="d81b741955-software-0">SPSS</rs> version <rs corresp="#d81b741955-software-0" resp="#annotator3" type="version">20.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#d81b741955-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SPSS Inc</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical analyses included chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and multivariate logistic regression analysis to assess the relationship between CSDH and various factors. Differences were considered statistically significant if the p value was less than 0.05.</p>

            <p>A shotgun metagenomics approach was applied on all three size fractions of four samples from Lakes Cis&#243; and Banyoles C-III.

KO annotation was used for functional analysis and KO counts were normalized according to the length of the read and the length of the target gene <ref type="bibr">(Sharon et al., 2009)</ref>. The communities and functional profiles found in each size fraction were highly similar (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref>) and, therefore, we pooled all reads after normalizing for sequencing depth for subsequent analyses, which allows for a better comparison of metagenomes. The functional analyses focused on the three main biogeochemical cycles for this type of lakes, that is, carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) cycling. The genetic potential of the microbial community was analyzed following the C, N, and S marker genes (KOs) as reported by <ref type="bibr">Lauro et al. (2011)</ref> with a few modifications. We amended this previous rubric by adding the anaerobic carbon fixation carried out through the Calvin cycle by Chromatiaceae, and additional genes for polysulfide reduction, nitrate reduction and nitrite oxidation. In addition, the genes pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (porA/B) were not considered as marker genes for fermentation as in <ref type="bibr">Lauro et al. (2011)</ref>, because they are key genes in the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle used for carbon fixation by Epsilonproteobacteria abundant in our study lakes <ref type="bibr">(Campbell and Cary, 2004; Takai et al., 2005)</ref>. Because both sulfide oxidation and dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathways are mediated by the same set of genes (aprA, aprB and dsrA) but are found in different families of bacteria, we assigned metagenomic reads to each pathway according to phylogeny, that is, sulfate reduction for Firmicutes and Deltaproteobacteria reads, and sulfide oxidation for Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Chlorobiaceae and Chromatiaceae. Finally, for the sulfur-oxidizing Epsilonproteobacteria of the order Campylobacterales we specifically searched for sox genes (coding for thiosulfate oxidation) not currently available in the KEGG database.

            <p>Our beat synchronization task was based on Kirshner and Tomasello's (2009) social drumming entrainment paradigm for preschoolers. The experimenter sat across from the child with two conga drums between them, one for the experimenter and one for the participant. Each conga had a Pulse Percussion DR-1 drum trigger attached to the underside of its drumhead to record the drum hits and convert vibrations into voltage in real time with no delay. The experimenter covertly listened and drummed to an isochronous beat presented through an in-ear headphone and encouraged the child to imitate and drum along with the experimenter. Auditory stimuli and drum hits of both the experimenter and participant were recorded as two separate two-channel recordings in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="e4ab54fee2-software-0">Audacity</rs> version <rs corresp="#e4ab54fee2-software-0" resp="#annotator7" type="version">2.0.5</rs>. Four trials were performed: two trials at 2.5 Hz followed by two trials at 1.67 Hz. Each trial was 20 s in duration, resulting in 50 isochronous drum hits for the 2.5 Hz trials and 33 drum hits for the 1.67 Hz trials. The use of two rates allowed for the assessment of general synchronization ability as opposed to synchronization to a specific rate, reducing the potential bias of an individual's preferred tempo.</p>
            <p>2.2.1. Data processing-Synchronization data were processed using software developed in house in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="e4ab54fee2-software-2">MATLAB</rs> (<rs corresp="#e4ab54fee2-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Mathworks, Inc</rs>., Natick, MA). Due to the high intersubject variability in intensity and rapidity of drumming, drum hits for the experimenter and participant were detected by setting an amplitude threshold and a refractory period on a participant-by-participant basis. The first point at which the signal exceeded the amplitude threshold was marked as a hit, immediately followed by a refractory period during which the program did not mark peaks (to ensure multiple points were not marked for each hit). Accuracy of automated hit detection was checked manually to ensure onsets were correctly marked for each hit. <ref type="bibr">(Fisher, 1993)</ref>, a useful tool for assessing sensorimotor synchronization when there is not one-to-one correspondence of hits and pacing stimuli <ref type="bibr">(Kirschner and Tomasello, 2009; Sowi&#324;ski and Dalla Bella, 2013; Fujii and Schlaug, 2013)</ref>, as is the case with this dataset: children frequently missed hits or did not synchronize continuously over a session. Each drum hit was assigned a relative phase angle (&#952; or "accuracy") in degrees by subtracting the hit time from the nearest experimenter's hit, dividing the result by the ISI, and multiplying by 360. The mean of all vectors resulted in R, a measurement of the extent to which participants tended to maintain a constant temporal relationship between their drum hits and the experimenter's. We define beat synchronization "consistency" as the average vector length across each of the two trials and across both rates. These two measures seem largely independent (correlation between consistency and accuracy: r (25) = &#8722;0.275, p = 0.183). Recent work has shown the ability to synchronize to an external beat is still developing during this age <ref type="bibr">(Kirschner and Tomasello, 2009; Woodruff Carr et al., 2014)</ref>. Therefore, Rayleigh's test was applied to the set of all vectors produced in the two trials for a given rate to determine whether a participant was successfully synchronizing (the null hypothesis of this test is that the distribution of data points occur randomly in time near or away from the pacing stimuli onsets, indicative of chance performance; p &gt; 0.05). The two trials at each rate were combined to compute a Rayleigh's p-value for each rate. If a child's Rayleigh's test resulted in a p &lt;0.05 at both rates, the child was included in analyses. Our previous work (Woodruff <ref type="bibr">Carr et al., 2014)</ref> investigated group differences in neural processing between children who could (p &lt; 0.05) and could not (p &gt; 0.05) synchronize; the current investigation expands upon this work by investigating neural correlates of synchronization ability within an expanded group of successful synchronizers. <ref type="bibr">(Klatt, 1980</ref>Additionally, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were collected to a 100 &#181;s square wave click stimulus presented in rarefaction at 80 dB SPL at a 31.3 Hz sampling rate. 2000 sweeps were presented.</p>
            <p>were presented monaurally to the right ear through an insert earphone (ER-3, Etymotic Research, Elk Grove Village, IL) while the participant sat watching a movie of their choice in a sound-attenuated booth (IAC Acoustics, Bronx, NY). The left ear remained unblocked so that the soundtrack of the movie (&lt;40 dB SPL) was audible but not loud enough to mask presented stimuli. FFRs were collected using BioSEMI Active2 with an ActiABR module recorded in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="e4ab54fee2-software-5">LabView</rs> <rs corresp="#e4ab54fee2-software-5" resp="#annotator7" type="version">2.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#e4ab54fee2-software-5" resp="#curator" type="publisher">National Instruments</rs>, Austin, TX). Responses were digitized at 16.384 kHz and collected with an online bandpass filter from 100 to 3000 Hz (20 dB/decade roll-off). The active electrode was placed at the vertex (Cz), with references on each earlobe. Grounding electrodes CMS and DRL were placed on the forehead at Fp1 and Fp2, respectively. Only ipsilateral-referenced (Cz-Right earlobe) responses were used in analyses. Offset voltage was &lt;50 mV for all electrodes.</p>
            <p>to speech stimuli were offline amplified in the frequency domain 20 dB per decade for 3 decades below 100 Hz, bandpass filtered from 70 to 2000 Hz (12 dB/octave roll-off), segmented into epochs with an interval of &#8722;40 to 210 ms (in relation to the stimulus onset), and baseline-corrected to the pre-stimulus period. Responses exceeding &#177;35 &#181;V were rejected as artifacts and remaining sweeps were averaged. Final responses to each syllable comprised 2000 artifact-free sweeps of each polarity, and responses to the two polarities were added to accentuate the response to the speech envelope <ref type="bibr">(Aiken and Picton, 2008)</ref> and limit the influence of cochlear microphonic and stimulus artifact <ref type="bibr">(Campbell et al., 2012)</ref>.

            <p>The FFR faithfully reproduces spectrotemporal stimulus features due to the inferior colliculus' ability to encode fine timing information <ref type="bibr">(Liu et al., 2006; Warrier et al., 2011)</ref>. Intertrial stability of the ABR was assessed using a procedure previously reported <ref type="bibr">(Hornickel and Kraus, 2013; Tierney and Kraus, 2013a,b)</ref>.To calculate the stability of a participant's response to the speech stimuli, 2000 of 4000 trials were randomly selected and averaged. The remaining 2000 trials were also averaged. The two sub-averaged waveforms were then correlated over the 0 to 170 ms range to determine their similarity. These steps were repeated 300 different times, each with different random samplings of trials, and the 300 correlation values were averaged to generate a final measure of intertrial neural response stability. Neural stability for encoding the click stimulus was assessed over 0 to 11.95 ms of the response using the same methodology: the two subaveraged waveforms (1000 randomly selected, averaged trials) were correlated to determine similarity 100 times, each with different random samplings of trials, and the correlation values were averaged. To specifically examine the timing variability in frequency encoding of the 170 ms speech-evoked FFR, intertrial phase-locking <ref type="bibr">(Tierney and Kraus, 2013a,b)</ref> was calculated in 20 Hz windows surrounding the fundamental frequency of the stimulus (100 Hz) and its harmonics up to 1000 Hz. Time-frequency spectrum was calculated using a short-time fast Fourier transform that resulted in a matrix containing two measures for each time &#215; frequency point: a vector length (the extent to which each frequency is encoded in the FFR) and phase (the timing of that frequency). To specifically analyze the timing variability, each vector was transformed into a unit vector. For each frequency, the 4000 vectors were averaged and the length of the resulting vector was calculated as a measure of the consistency of phase across trials. Low frequency phase-locking was captured by averaging across the vectors for 100, 200, 300, and 400 Hz, while high frequency phase-locking was computed as a mean of the vectors for harmonics 500-1000 Hz. Intertrial neural stability and phase-locking correlation values were Fisher and log transformed to conform to the expectations of a linear model (normality and sphericity).

            <p>Pearson correlations were used to compare intertrial neural stability and phase-locking across stimuli (mean of [ba] + [da] + [ga]) to beat synchronization consistency. Phaselocking was averaged across low-frequency harmonics (100-400 Hz) and high-frequency harmonics (500-1000 Hz). Hierarchical two-step linear regressions were employed to determine how neural stability and phase-locking predicted variance in beat synchronization over and above demographic factors.

            <p>Behavioural analysis. Behavioural analysis was performed to assess the development of tactile allodynia in mice. Tactile allodynia was measured using a von Frey filament (North Coast Medical, Gilroy, CA, USA). Mice were placed in glass cages with a wire mesh bottom and allowed to habituate for at least 1 h. A von Frey filament with bending forces of 0.16 g (innocuous stimulation) was pressed perpendicularly against the plantar skin of a hind-paw. The paw withdrawal responses to the mechanical stimulus were evaluated by scoring as follows: 0, no response; 1, lifting the hind-paw within 3 s; 2, lifting the hind-paw over 3 s; and 3, immediate flinching or licking of the hind-paw. The stimulation of the same intensity was applied seven times to each hind-paw at several seconds intervals and the total served as the pain-related score (score) in the SNL model.

The tip resistance of the patch pipettes was 6-12 MO. Series resistance was assessed from current in response to a 5-mV hyperpolarizing step. Series resistance was monitored during the recording session and data were rejected if its value changed by 415%. Ion currents were monitored with a patchclamp amplifier (Axopatch 700A, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The data were digitized with an analog-to-digital converter (Digidata 1321A, Molecular Devices), stored on a personal computer using a data acquisition program (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="a4b9899206-software-1">Clampex</rs> version <rs corresp="#a4b9899206-software-1" resp="#annotator4" type="version">10</rs>, <rs corresp="#a4b9899206-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Molecular Devices</rs>) and analyzed using a software package<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="a4b9899206-software-2">Clampfit</rs> version <rs corresp="#a4b9899206-software-2" resp="#annotator4" type="version">10</rs> (<rs corresp="#a4b9899206-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Molecular Devices</rs>).

            <p>Sequencing of the recombinant plasmids and the PCR amplification products was performed according to <ref type="bibr">Lata et al. (2010)</ref>.

The input for <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-simple-6">MODELLER</rs> consisted of the aligned sequences of 1gcc and the SiDREB2, a steering file that gives all the necessary commands to the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-simple-7">MODELLER</rs> to produce a homology model of the target on the basis of its alignment with the template.

            <p>About 2 lg of total RNA was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA primed with oligo(dT) in a 20 ll reaction mix using Protoscript M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. qRT-PCR was performed using Power SYBER-Green dye (Applied Biosystems) on a step one real-time PCR system of Applied Biosysytems in triplicate. The constitutive actin gene (CAA33874.1) was used as the endogenous control (Actin RT_F, 5#-CTGACGCCGAGGATATCCA-3#; and Actin RT_R, 5#-GCCTTGACCATACCAGTTCCA-3#). The amount of transcript accumulated for the SiDREB2 gene (SiDREB2 RT_F, 5#-GCCTTGTAGTCATTTGTGGTTT-3#; and SiDREB2 RT_R, 5#-CCTCACAACTCCTTTTCTCAAGCT-3#) normalized to the internal control actin was analysed using the 2-DD Ct method <ref type="bibr">(Livak and Schmittgen, 2001)</ref>. The primers used for real-time PCR analysis were designed by using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-9">Primer Express</rs> Version <rs corresp="#dcaa921fa3-software-9" resp="#annotator8" type="version">3.0</rs>. The PCR cycling conditions were: initial denaturation at 95&#176;C for 10 min, 95&#176;C for 15 s, 60&#176;C for 1 min for 40 cycles, 95&#176;C for 15 s, and 60&#176;C for 1 min and 95&#176;C for 15 s.</p>
            <p>A core set of 45 foxtail millet accessions, listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, were analysed for SNP discovery by re-sequencing of the SiDREB2 gene. Genomic DNA was extracted as mentioned earlier. The SiDREB2 FL_F/SiDREB2 FL_R primer pair was used to amplify full-length SiDREB2 in all 45 accessions. PCR was performed using Sigma Taq DNA polymerase (1 U) in a 20 ll reaction volume containing ;50 ng of gemonic DNA, 13 PCR buffer (1.5 mM MgCl 2 ), 10 lM of each dNTP, and 10 pmol of each primer. PCR cycling was done as mentioned earlier. Amplified PCR products were precipitated and sequenced in both directions. Sequences were aligned by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-simple-12">ClustalW</rs>.</p>
            <p>Multiple sequence alignment revealed that SiDREB2 has high similarity to DREB proteins from other plants <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. S1 available at JXB online)</ref>. Highsequence similarity in the AP2/ERF domain indicated that DREB genes were well conserved among gramineous crops <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1B)</ref>. To determine further the relatedness of SiDREB2 to the other AP2/EREBP proteins, a systematic phylogenetic analysis was carried out based on the similarities of AP2 domains in the proteins isolated from Arabidopsis, rice, maize, wheat, sorghum, barley, Festuca, Phyllostachys, tomato, tobacco, cotton, Catharanthus, and Brassica species using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-14">MEGA</rs> <rs corresp="#dcaa921fa3-software-14" resp="#annotator8" type="version">4.0</rs> by the NJ method <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1C)</ref>. SiDREB2 was classified into the A-2 subgroup of the DREB subfamily on the basis of the phylogenetic tree constructed.</p>
            <p>Knowledge of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of a protein is a necessary prerequisite for understanding its molecular function. To create a 3D structure of SiDREB2, a <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-simple-15">BLAST</rs> search was performed in protein databases for proteins with similar sequence and known 3D structure, but no significant homologous template was found to model the complete sequence. Thus, ab initio modelling of SiDREB2 was done with the help of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-simple-16">I-TASSER</rs> server. In brief, this is a hierarchical protein structure modelling approach based on the secondary structure-enhanced Profile-Profile threading alignment <ref type="bibr">(Zhang, 2008)</ref>. The model structure was validated with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-simple-17">PROSA</rs> (z-score of -5.58) which was in the range of native conformations of other experimentally determined protein structures of the same size <ref type="bibr">(Wiederstein and Sippl, 2007)</ref>. The overall structure has an a-b fold and the DNA-binding domain contained antiparallel b-sheets and an a-helix packed approximately parallel to the b-sheet <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1D)</ref>. This domain, which is highly positively charged,binds the negatively charged DNA double helix. The tertiary structure is stabilized by 224 intramolecular hydrogen bonds as determined by the program <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-simple-18">HBPLUS</rs> <ref type="bibr">(McDonald and Thornton, 1994)</ref>. The majority of these hydrogen bonds (44%) are formed by atoms where both the acceptor and donor are from the main chain of the amino acid residues. Only in 25% of the cases are both the acceptor and donor atoms the side chain atoms. The rest (31%) are observed where both main chain and side chain atoms are participating.</p>
            <p>The structure of the AP2 domain of AtERF1 from Arabidopsis thaliana (PDB code 1gcc) was taken as a template for the comparative modelling of the DNA-binding domain of SiDREB2 <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1E)</ref> <ref type="bibr">(Allen et al., 1998)</ref>. The sequence alignment between the target and the template is shown in <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. S1</ref> at JXB online. In addition, the secondary structure of this domain as predicted by several secondary structure prediction servers (<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-18">PHDsec</rs>:<rs corresp="#dcaa921fa3-software-18" resp="#curator" type="url">www.predictprotein.org</rs>/; <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-19">PSIPRED</rs>: <rs corresp="#dcaa921fa3-software-19" resp="#curator" type="url">http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac. uk/psipred</rs>/) is quite similar to the secondary structure of 1gcc <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. S1, and Fig. 1E)</ref>. This finding supports the results obtained from several fold recognition servers (<rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-20">FUGUE</rs>:<rs corresp="#dcaa921fa3-software-20" resp="#curator" type="url">www-cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/;fugue</rs>/;<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-21">3DPSSM</rs>: <rs corresp="#dcaa921fa3-software-21" resp="#curator" type="url">www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk</rs>/), suggesting that SiDREB2 has the fold of the DNA-binding domain of the DREB superfamily. Based on the above information, the 'A' subunit of 1gcc was used as a template to predict the 3D structure of SiDREB2 by applying the comparative modelling strategy as described in the Materials and methods. The overall rmsd (root mean square deviation) between the template and the target structure is 0.2 &#197; . The calculated angle between the b-sheet and a-helices is ;172&#176;. The amino acid residues Arg6, Arg8, Trp10, Glu16, Arg18, Arg25, and Trp27 that are known to make direct contact with the DNA double helix for deciphering the DNA-binding activity are also fully conserved.</p>
            <p>The importance of allele-specific PCR systems for reliable SNP typing has been demonstrated several times in previous studies <ref type="bibr">(Wu et al., 1989; Wei et al., 2006)</ref>. Introduction of additional mismatch bases has improved the specificity of this technique <ref type="bibr">(Drenkard et al., 2000)</ref>. Its application is especially important for an accurate discrimination of different alleles in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-simple-27">MAS</rs>. In the present study, only one pair of ASPs was used to amplify the specific products from the dehydration-tolerant and sensitive accessions. Therefore, the ASM can be effectively used to type SNPs as well as to avoid unambiguous false scoring. The functional differences in trait performance mainly caused by SNPs has also been reported in previous studies on several cloned genes <ref type="bibr">(Peng et al., 1999; Takahashi et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2002; Jin et al., 2003; Toshiyuki et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2005; Garc&#233;s- Claver et al., 2007; Fan et al., 2009)</ref>. Molecular markerassisted breeding technology is a rapid and accurate method for any candidate gene, providing a very effective tool for backcross breeding <ref type="bibr">(Collard and Mackill, 2008)</ref>. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-simple-28">MAS</rs> efficiency is influenced by several complex factors such as recombination between the marker and the candidate gene, a low level of polymorphism between the parents with contrasting traits, and lower resolution of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) due to environmental interactions. In the present study, the ASM is part of the candidate gene, thus eliminating the main disadvantage of <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dcaa921fa3-software-simple-29">MAS</rs>. However, the ASM developed in this study is a dominant marker, and therefore it cannot distinguish the heterozygotes. The marker has high reliability and efficiency, and the desired PCR product can be identified easily on a simple agarose gel. With the help of this marker, dehydration-tolerant accessions can be selected at a variety of life stages. This is particularly true when the target is the dehydration-tolerant allele in backcross breeding and thus the foxtail millet breeding process can be accelerated. Further, the ASM identified would facilitate allele mining of foxtail millet germplasm resources, thereby leading to identification and utilization of newer alleles in crop improvement.</p>

For the purpose of this report, hepatitis B surveillance data between January 2004 and December 2013 were analyzed. Prevalence trends refer to rates over time of diagnosed seropositive cases of hepatitis B. The carriage rate for a certain yea, or demographic group (gender, age group) was calculated by dividing the number of reported seropositive cases for hepatitis B for that year, or demographic group by the corresponding estimated population for that year, or demographic group, then multiplied to give the rate per 100,000. All data were analyzed using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="c01189bbb3-software-0">Statistical Package for Social Sciences</rs> version <rs corresp="#c01189bbb3-software-0" resp="#annotator7" type="version">20.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#c01189bbb3-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SPSS Inc</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA) to calculate the odds ratios (OR) and the respective 95% confidence interval (CI) for the decline in hepatitis B prevalence between 2004 and 2013. We used the 2004 prevalence for reference to calculate the OR and p-values compared with this year. Data were analyzed using univariate analysis. We used 5% (p&lt;0.05) as a level of significance.</p>

            <p>Although technology can target the PWD themselves, the vast majority of telemedicine and smart technologies are designed to support family caregivers. Two separate systematic reviews highlight the benefits of web-based caregiver support programs. <ref type="bibr">29</ref> Web-based training and educational programs to support caregivers are readily available. The InternetBased Savvy Caregiver, based on the validated Savvy Caregiver program, <ref type="bibr">30</ref> is an example. It provides an interactive, iterative curriculum that improves knowledge about, and competence for, caregiving. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> A customized computer-telephone integration system, <rs cert="0.4" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="f58780be93-software-simple-0">e-care</rs>, provides a psychoeducational intervention that identifies resources and strategies to enhance safety, communication, selfcare, social support, and management of problem behaviors in the community. <ref type="bibr">31</ref> The system features screen phones with hierarchal menus (text and voice) that enables users to 1) place and receive calls, 2) send and retrieve messages, 3) access a range of information and services, and 4) conference with several people simultaneously. This system was effective in decreasing caregiver burden and depression significantly in depression scores in caregivers with high depression scores at baseline. <ref type="bibr">31</ref> Another type of in-home caregiver support links caregivers with expert guidance for managing challenging care situations using video monitoring. Caregivers are trained to capture behaviors that are a problem via computer video recording, which is then wirelessly uploaded for a team of experts to review and provide feedback. In a pilot study, this system demonstrated improved behavior management and caregiver communication and was reported as easy to use. 32 Support for caregivers can also be provided via web-based video conferencing and/or text-based chat forums. <ref type="bibr">33</ref> There is growing use and acceptance of video conferencing in both the diagnosis and monitoring in geriatric medical <ref type="bibr">34</ref> and geriatric psychiatry care. <ref type="bibr">35-37</ref> Though further large-scale studies are needed, research has established the reliability and validity for neurocognitive testing and neurological examinations via video telemedicine. <ref type="bibr">35,37,38</ref> Video conferencing can also link local primary care professionals to specialists for assessments, enhancing the administration of standardized assessments and examinations. <ref type="bibr">35,36</ref> Telehealth diagnosis and monitoring have been welcomed in remote and rural areas and with Spanishspeaking and Native American populations, as access to specialized services is limited in these underserved areas. <ref type="bibr">39,40</ref></p>

After washing the surface by gentle vortexing in PBS, the tissue was soaked in PBS containing Fluo-4 AM (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) at a final concentration of 10 mM with brief sonication. Fluo-4 AM was allowed to enter the cells for 20 min, and the tissue was then washed in PBS. The tissue was sandwiched by two thin glasses in PBS and observed. The real-time confocal microscope imaging system used in this study was composed of an inverted epifluorescence microscope Eclipse Ti-U (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), a CSU-X1 laserscanning unit with a 520612.5 nm band-pass filter (Yokogawa, Tokyo, Japan), and an ImagEM EM-CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan).

            <p>As mentioned before, the KKT conditions of the period-3 problem of the PNP model constitute a LCP. We solve it, for each contingent state, by minimizing the complementarity conditions subject to the linear equality constraints and the non-negativity constraints. 17 The period-2 problem of the PNP model is an EPEC, in which each firm faces a Mathematical Program subject to Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC). <ref type="bibr">18</ref> We attempt to solve for equilibrium, if at least one exists, by iterative deletion of dominated strategies. That is, we sequentially solve each firm's profit-maximization problem using as data the optimal values from previously solved problems. Thus, starting from a feasible solution, we solve for g 1 using g <ref type="bibr">(&#8722;1)</ref> as data in the first firm's optimization problem (where g (&#8722;1) means all firms' generation capacities except for firm 1's), then solve for <ref type="bibr">17</ref> Recall that any LCP can be written as the problem of finding a vector x &#8712; n such that x = q + M &#183; y, x T &#183; y = 0, x &#8805; 0, and y &#8805; 0, where M &#8712; n&#215;n , q &#8712; n , and y &#8712; n . Thus, we can solve it by minimizing x T &#183; y subject to x = q + M &#183; y, x &#8805; 0, and y &#8805; 0. If the previous problem has an optimal solution where the objective function is zero, then that solution also solves the corresponding LCP. Greater details about the methodology used for solving LCPs are given in <ref type="bibr">(Hobbs, 2001)</ref>. 18 See <ref type="bibr">(Yao et al., 2004)</ref> for definitions of both EPEC and MPEC.g 2 using g <ref type="bibr">(&#8722;2)</ref> as data, and so on.

We test our model from a set of different starting points and using different generation-firms' optimization order. All these trials gave us the same results.

            <p>Functional annotation for iRC1080 was performed using a consensus of two separate approaches. In the first approach, gene models (http:// augustus.gobics.de/predictions/chlamydomonas/augustus.u5.aa) from the Augustus update 5 (Au5) of C. reinhardtii genome assembly version JGI v4.0 were functionally annotated by assigning enzyme classification (EC) terms using  <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="abff41cd16-software-simple-0">BLASTP</rs> results against UniProt (http:// www.uniprot.org/) and AraCyc (http://www.arabidopsis.org/biocyc/) enzyme protein sequences and their EC annotations as the basis. The second approach followed from mapping of Au5 gene models to annotated JGI v3.1 gene models, for which EC terms and Gene Ontology annotation were assigned using a combination of <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="abff41cd16-software-simple-1">BLASTP</rs>,  <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="abff41cd16-software-simple-2">AutoFACT</rs>, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="abff41cd16-software-simple-3">InterProScan</rs>, and  <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="abff41cd16-software-simple-4">PRIAM</rs>. The comprehensive annotation is presented in Supplementary</p>
            <p>ORF amplicons were generated from C. reinhardtii cells by RT-PCR from RNA or PCR from Gateway clones.

            <p>All relevant data were recorded by the pharmacist in an internal database, using IBM <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="cc6bb74752-software-0">SPSS</rs> for Windows <rs corresp="#cc6bb74752-software-0" resp="#annotator3" type="version">20.0</rs>. Patient data were documented by assigning an individual patient number, case number, gender, age and date of observation. In order to enable the evaluation, the initially documented ADRs were coded numerically according to the system organ classes (SOCs) of the MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) terminology, and the specific symptom. Also, corresponding causality categories were entered numerically. For every documented ADR and week, a single data set containing patient details, medication, daily dosage and causality category for every given AED was generated. Where the same ADR was documented more than once for one patient, the first documented observation and accordingly the one with the lowest AED dosages was included for analysis only. For patients without ADRs, the highest AED dosage was considered. To rule out possible input errors, the data were entered twice at different times. Asserted discrepancies were clarified by re-checking the record forms.</p>

            <p>According to the definition, the in-air output factor (Sc) can be written as <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.2; which numerator and denominator are chamber readings (R) for the same number of monitor units (M) in the presence of a build-up cap for a field with dimensions L and L0 (as a reference field e.g. 10&#215;10cm 2 ) at SSD=100cm and collimator opening CL, C0 respectively. For the total scatter factor, measuring at the dmax in water phantom for a specific field (L) to that reference field (L0) for the same number of monitor units (M) <ref type="bibr">(13)</ref>, it would be written as <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.3. To prevent electron contamination of the photon beam, it is recommended that all readings are performed at a depth of d=10 cm and then they are transmitted to the maximum depth using PDD (d) for that field size <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref>. So, the formula in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.4. According to <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>., L, L0 (field size), CL, and C0 (collimator opening) are shown as AB, EF, , and respectively. As can be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, the total scatter factor is obtained by dividing the dosimeter reading which is caused by primary and secondary radiation (S') from two volume VABCD and reference volume VEFGH and then correct for depth d to dmax. The Sp is defined as the ratio of the absorbed dose at the dmax in phantom (water or solid water) Page 3525 for a given field to that in the reference field with the same collimator opening (C0) to eliminate the collimator effect <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref>. Therefore, the formula in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.5. In this study, to maintain the collimator opening for all fields, the phantom surface can be pulled up (for L&lt;L0) or down (for L&gt;L0) <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). For example, for a field smaller than L0, L=AB, it is necessary to pull up phantom surface to J=(L/L0) &#215;SSD to achieve the same collimator opening. However, care must be which the dosimeter reading at J' needs to be corrected for SSD changes using Mayneord Factor. Therefore; we have to perform dosimetry in several SSDs and the main problem is phantom surface collision with Linac head for small fields. On the other hand, according to Eq. 3 and 5, the difference between the Sp and the total scatter factor is the amount of the collimator opening. Therefore, by considering a correction factor (for the effect of collimator) in the total scatter factor (Eq. 4), Sp can be achieved (Eq.5) as <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.6. In <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> with regards to the Pythagorean theorem, the trapezoid ABC"D" and A'B'C'D' are equal; therefore, the Sp is obtained by dividing the dosimeter readings at S' form two volume VA'B'C"D" and reference volume VEFGH. In this method, we propose to apply a factor (&#945;) to correct scatter portion reached to the dosimeter (S') from VABCD to VABC"D". As mentioned in previous studies <ref type="bibr">(15, 16)</ref>, suppose that there is a parallel beam striking the surface of the phantom and consider a reference plane normal to the central axis, placed at depth d=10cm which the origin is on the central axis. Hence, each element (dx.dy) on this plane acts as a source of scattered radiation. The amount of scatter radiation reaching the central axis (dosimeter location, S') is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between surface elements and the origin. Therefore, with taking into account the photon attenuation &#181;, &#945; is defined as <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.7; Where &#181; is energy attenuation coefficient which depends on energy, field size and depth <ref type="bibr">(17, 18)</ref>. Therefore, the formula in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.8. &#945; will be greater or lesser than 1 while phantom surface was pulled up or down respectively. Let us eliminate the small area at the origin of the coordinate with radius &#949; (refers to the ion chamber radius =3mm) to overcome singularity in nominator and denominator in Eq.7 and use polar system <ref type="figure">Figure 3)</ref>. Therefore, the scatter contribution to dosimeter location (S') for a rectangular field with dimensions (2Y &#215; 2X) <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>) is calculated as <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.9. Finally, a general computer program using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e47e4e7c89-software-0">MATLAB</rs> <rs corresp="#e47e4e7c89-software-0" resp="#annotator3" type="version">7.12.0</rs> software was written to calculate &#945; using the numerical method to solve Eq. 9.</p>

            <p>Staphylococcus aureus was cultured overnight at 37&#176;C in BHI media, after which the culture was diluted 1:10 with the same media. This diluted solution (100 &#956;l) was spread onto plates and incubated at 37&#176;C for 6 h, followed by 6 h of cooling at 20&#176;C. For treatment with heat-killed pathogens, plates were incubated at 65&#176;C for 6 h to kill the pathogen. Worms were transferred to prepared media (previously seeded with heatkilled or live pathogens) and the live worms were counted every 6 h until no living worms remained. Data are presented as mean survival days, which were calculated using the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="d39a0e7d68-software-2">OASIS</rs> program <ref type="bibr">(Yang et al., 2011)</ref>.</p>

Mitochondrial membrane potential (&#968; m ) was measured by TMRE after wild type worms were fed heat-killed or live S. aureus (A and B, respectively). (C) and (D) represent TMRE stained ucp-4 mutants feeding on either heat-killed or live S. aureus, respectively. Scale bar = 100 &#956;m. (E) Mean survival days of the wild type and the ucp-4 mutant after exposure to pathogen-seeded plates. Each experimental result was calculated by <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="d39a0e7d68-software-simple-1">OASIS</rs>. The average of five experimental replicates was plotted. n &gt; 300 worms per line in each experiment. WT, wild type; ucp-4, ucp-4 mutant; egg, animals were exposed to the pathogen at the egg stage; L1-2, at L1-2 stage; L3-4, at L3-4 stage; adult day 1, 5, and 10, at day 1, 5, and 10, respectively. Error bars = SD. *p &lt; 0.05; **p &lt; 0.01, based on a Student's t-test.</p>
            <p>The ucp-4 mutant is resistant to the pathogen S. aureus Increased ROS can cause oxidative damage, especially in the mitochondria <ref type="bibr">(Harman, 1956)</ref>. However, an increase in ROS can be beneficial for innate immunity as a major defense system against pathogens <ref type="bibr">(Arsenijevic et al., 2000; Basu Ball et al., 2011)</ref>. Moreover, in C. elegans, increased ROS levels were shown to occur in the intestine at the site of pathogen infection <ref type="bibr">(Chavez et al., 2007)</ref>. Because UCP-4 is involved in regulating mitochondrial membrane potential (&#968; m ), we investigated the function of UCP-4 in the response to pathogens. First, we compared &#968; m using TMRE staining in wild types and in ucp-4 mutants upon exposure to either live (pathogenic) or heat-killed (non-pathogenic) Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). As seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>, the ucp-4 mutant had high &#968; m compared to that of the wild type without pathogen exposure (Figs. 4A and 4C, respectively). After pathogen exposure, there was no significant change in &#968; m between live and heat-killed pathogen exposed ucp-4 mutants <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4D)</ref>. In contrast, wild type worms showed an increase in &#968; m upon exposure to live pathogens <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4B)</ref>. This increased &#968; m could be related to pathogen resistance; we therefore assayed worm survival. We placed animals on pathogen-seeded plates during each developmental stage, specifically egg, L1-2, L3-4, and adult day 1, 5, and 10. After the worms were transferred, surviving animals were counted each day until all were dead. We used the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="d39a0e7d68-software-4">OASIS</rs> program to calculate mean survival days based on the raw data <ref type="bibr">(Yang et al., 2011)</ref>. As seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>E, the ucp-4 mutant survived longer than the wild type when exposed to the pathogen at the egg stage, L1-2, L3-4, and the young adult stage (day 1). However, exposure at the aged adult stages (days 5 and 10) produced different results. Specifically, the ucp-4 mutants were more susceptible to the pathogen compared to wild type at this stage.</p>

            <p>Confocal microscopy analysis. Drosophila S2 cells were plated in 12-well plastic tissue culture plate in 1 ml of Schneider's medium with 10% FBS. FITC-labeled (Invitrogen, USA) microbes were added to each well containing S2 cells at a density of 5 3 10 6 , followed by incubation for 1 hr at 28uC. After washes with PBS, the S2 cells were transferred to Poly-Prep glass slides (Sigma, USA) and fixed. Then the S2 cells were incubated with rhodamine phalloidin (Invitrogen, USA) or DAPI (Sigma, USA) to label actin or nucleus DNA, respectively. Fluorescent images were taken with a Zeiss Laser scanning systems LSM 510 Meta (Carl Zeiss, Germany) and processed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="bda8ed08f7-software-simple-0">Zeiss LSM Image</rs> Examiner Version software.</p>
            <p>Analyses of gene expressions with oligonucleotide microarray. S2 cells (1 3 10 6 ) were inoculated with DCV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 1 hr. Inactivated DCV was treated in the same way. The WSSV virions (1 3 10 7 copies/ mL) or inactivated WSSV virions (1 3 10 7 copies/mL) were inoculated into S2 cells (1 3 10 6 cells/mL) for 1 hr. Then total RNA was extracted from treated S2 cells by using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total RNA samples were then analyzed by CapitalBio Corp for Chip (Affymetrix) assay. Gene expression analysis was performed by using the Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA) Drosophila GeneChip, using the laboratory methods in the Affymetrix GeneChip expression manual. Gene expression analysis was performed using multiple arrays and multiple independent mRNA samples for each treatment. Microarray data were analyzed by using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="bda8ed08f7-software-4">Bio MAS (molecule annotation system)</rs> <rs corresp="#bda8ed08f7-software-4" resp="#annotator10" type="version">3.0</rs> software (<rs corresp="#bda8ed08f7-software-4" resp="#curator" type="publisher">CapitalBio Corporation</rs>, Beijing, China). Using the criterion of cutoff limitation as a fold change $2 or #0.5 and q-value #5%, differential expression genes were screened and clustered.</p>
            <p>Biological pathway analysis. Through array analysis, the commonly altered genes were screened from DCV, and WSSV treatments. The selected genes were further analyzed in the context of Gene Ontology (GO) biological process and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) biological pathway. Then the results of signaling pathway and protein interaction about these genes were analyzed by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="bda8ed08f7-software-0">MAS</rs> <rs corresp="#bda8ed08f7-software-0" resp="#annotator10" type="version">3.0</rs> software.

            <p>Quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNAs were extracted from S2 cells (1 3 10 6 ) using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then the total RNA (5 mg) was reversely transcribed to synthesize cDNA in a volume of 20 mL with reverse transcriptase M-MLV (Takara, Japan). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using gene-specific primers and TaqMan probe <ref type="table">(Table S2)</ref>. Relative expression levels of interest genes were calculated as previously described <ref type="bibr">43</ref>, using rp49 as an internal control in S2 cells. Real-time PCR was carried out in a final volume of 20 ml, which contained 10 ml Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa, Japan), 1 ml diluted cDNA template, 7.2 ml distilled water, 0.3 ml of each TaqMan probe and 0.4 ml of each primer. PCR conditions were as follows, 95uC for 30 seconds, followed by 50 cycles of 95uC for 5 seconds and 60uC for 30 seconds. Resultant data were analyzed using the<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="bda8ed08f7-software-simple-7">iQTM5</rs> software.</p>
            <p>WSSV quantitative analysis by TaqMan real-time PCR. TaqMan real-time PCR was performed by using a Perfect Real Time premix (Takara, Japan) containing a high-performance Taq antibody, Takara Ex Taq HS, for hotstart real-time PCR.<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="bda8ed08f7-software-2">Primer</rs> <rs corresp="#bda8ed08f7-software-2" resp="#annotator10" type="version">3</rs> software was used to design primers and the TaqMan probe with the WSSV whole sequence (GenBank accession no. AF332093). Primers WSSV-RT1 (59-TTGG TTTCATGCCCGAGATT-39) and WSSV-RT2 (59-CCTTGGTCAGCCCCTTGA-39) produced a fragment of 154 bp after amplification. The TaqMan probe was synthesized and labeled with the fluorescent dyes 5-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) (59-FAM-TGCTGCCGTCTCCAA-TAMRA-39). The reaction mixture consisted of DNA aliquot, 200 nM of each primer, 100 nM of each TaqMan probe, and 1 3 PCR reaction buffer containing DNA polymerase in a final reaction volume of 20 ml. PCR amplification was performed for 4 min at 50uC, followed by 45 cycles of 45 s at 95uC, 45 s at 52uC and 45 s at 72uC. Thermal cycling was performed on an iCycle IQ5 realtime PCR detection system (Bio-RAD, USA).</p>

            <p>The HRQoL scores that form the raw data for this analysis are rank-order in nature. Means and SDs of the scores were estimated using generalised estimating equations for illustrative purposes only. Physical and mental composite scores were calculated in the modified SF-36 according to the SF-12 scoring guidelines. <ref type="bibr">16 17</ref> Group comparison and covariate effect size calculation, OR (with 95% CIs and p values) were estimated using repeated measures of ordinal logistic regression, with covariates selected for inclusion by backward stepwise regression ( p-value for exclusion 0.22) from maternal age, Hb, ferritin, Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas ( based on the Collector District of residence of mothers), quality of sleep, use and duration of breastfeeding, hospitalisation of the baby, baby gender and mode of delivery. This included randomisation group covariate interactions in the starting model with exclusion of those interactions using the above criteria. When iron status was selected for inclusion in the model, the association between iron status (ferritin) and HRQoL was reported independently of the trial treatment group. p Values were corrected for multiple comparisons where necessary by the Holm method. The effect of intravenous iron versus oral iron on time of cessation of breastfeeding was compared by estimation of the HR with 95% CIs and p values by Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted for covariates selected for inclusion by backward stepwise regression ( p-value for exclusion 0.22). The time to cessation of breast-feeding was taken from the subject's baby growth booklet for all participants.

Normal distributions were tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The Levene's test was applied assessing the homogeneity of variances for between-group comparisons. Baseline overall cognitive state and differences in demographics between groups, selected and unselected participants of the CT, and drop-outs and completers of the CPT were compared between groups. We used t-tests for independent samples to compare the age, Mann-Whitney tests to compare performance in DemTect and education, and chi-square tests for the comparison of the sex distribution, each with a significance level of &#945;=0.05. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="be3bdc5c5f-software-1">G*Power</rs> (<rs corresp="#be3bdc5c5f-software-1" resp="#annotator8" type="url">http://www.gpower.hhu.de</rs>) was used to estimate the achieved power with a post hoc analysis. <ref type="bibr">37</ref></p>
            <p>Gains from CT from pre-to post-test and to 1 year follow-up were estimated with analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures (rANOVAs) with a significance level of &#945;=0.05. Due to the intercorrelations between the different cognitive variables (eg, DemTect subscores with the total score), a multivariate analysis was not appropriate. The within-subject variable Time had three levels (pretest vs post-test vs follow-up). The between-subject variable Training had two levels (CPT vs pure CT). The interaction Time &#215; Training was used to specify which training group showed stronger effects. We report Greenhouse-Geisser values to handle possible violations of sphericity. The effect size partial &#951;&#178; (&#951; p &#178;) is reported, indicating a small (&#951; p &#178;.0.01), moderate (&#951; p &#178;.0.06), or strong effect (&#951; p &#178;.0.14). <ref type="bibr">38</ref> In a second step, post hoc pairwise comparisons were calculated for the significant Time effects of the rANOVAs.

            <p>Using <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="d539045eca-software-3">TALE-NT</rs> <rs corresp="#d539045eca-software-3" resp="#annotator2" type="version">2.0</rs> (TALE Effector Nucleotide Targeter 2.0) <ref type="bibr">28</ref>, we were able to confirm that these positive clones are predicted to bind to either the plus or minus strand of three specific locationswithin the SCN9A bait sequence. Five of the TALE-VP16 clones are illustrated together with their corresponding position <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2b)</ref>. To confirm these results, we first generated baits that exclude those predicted DNA target sites. For example, the positive clone T110 induced the expression of Aba resistance gene when the bait sequence is intact <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 5a)</ref> but it failed to produce surviving clones when the specific DNA target site (59-GTTGC-CTCCCC-39) was removed <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 5b)</ref>. Subsequently, we cloned these TALE-VP16 fusions into a mammalian expression vector, transiently transfected the plasmids into human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) and human squamous carcinoma cells (A431), and measured the expression level of SCN9A by quantitative RT-PCR (Methods, Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR). All fusions were able to effectively drive the overexpression of the SCN9A gene in both cell lines (up to 11-fold increase for HEK293 cells and 8.5-fold increase for A431 cells) <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2c)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Our results clearly demonstrate that the complete library can be used to isolate TALEs that bind to a desired DNA sequence. Importantly, we observed that TALE-VP16 can be designed to bind to the minus strand of a target sequence and in addition, can also be designed to target sequences within the ORF. We emphasize that one fundamental difference between our approach and all previous applications of TALEs is that our screening procedure does not rely on TALE-DNA binding prediction algorithms <ref type="bibr">28,30</ref>. This is a considerable advantage as available algorithms may not yet fully capture the dynamics of TALE-DNA interactions. Indeed, we designed four 11-mer TALE-VP16 constructs for the same SCN9A bait sequence using the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="d539045eca-software-4">TALE-NT</rs> <rs corresp="#d539045eca-software-4" resp="#annotator2" type="version">2.0</rs> program (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>) and observed that all fusions, as well as combinations, failed to induce the overexpression of SCN9A mRNA levels in HEK293 <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2c, Supplementary Figs. 7 and 9</ref>). Additional insight can be gathered from recovered RVDs <ref type="table">(Supplementary Table 3</ref>), as none of the isolated positive TALE-VP16 clones contain RVD sequences exactly matching the canonical TALE-DNA binding code. As an example, for the target sequence 59-GTTGCCTCCCC-39, instead of the predicted canonical RVD sequence the four isolated clones contained at least one RVD difference. Therefore, the TALE-DNA binding information extracted from our library can be used in the future to refine the TALE-DNA binding algorithms.</p>
            <p>Prediction of target sequences. All rescued pGADT7-TALE-VP16 plasmids were subjected to standard Sanger sequencing using the forward primer P23 and the reverse primer P24 <ref type="table">(Supplementary Table 1)</ref>, which are flanking sequences of the DNA binding domain of TALE proteins. After extracting the RVD sequences, the TALE potential target sequences were determined by the Target Finder function of<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="d539045eca-software-6">TALE-NT</rs> <rs corresp="#d539045eca-software-6" resp="#annotator2" type="version">2.0</rs> 28 using the setting ''upstream base T''. Since <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d539045eca-software-7">TALE-NT</rs> <rs corresp="#d539045eca-software-7" resp="#annotator2" type="version">2.0</rs> only supports sequences which are between 12 and 31 RVDs, for each TALE we conducted four searches by adding one additional RVD (HD or NN or NI or NG) to the end of our RVD sequences. The lowest score from one of these four searches was defined as ''the lowest possible score''. The targets were considered as potentially genuine only when the lowest possible score is less than 9, as lower scores indicate higher confidence of the bindings between TALE fusions and their predicted DNA target sequences.Invitrogen, #15140). For transient transfection, ,300 thousand cells in 1 mL of complete medium were plated into each well of 12-well culture treated plastic plates (Griener Bio-One, #665180) and grown for 16-20 hours. For jetPRIME (Polyplus Transfection, #114-15) transfection, up to 1 mg of the plasmid was added to 75 mL of jetPRIME buffer and 1.75 mL of jetPRIME. Transfection solutions were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The transfection mixture was then applied to the cells and mixed with the medium by gently shaking.</p>

The amount of final product on the denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels was quantified by densiometric analysis using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="dd70cb48f4-software-simple-2">Quantity One</rs> Software. The concentration of each 6-modified-3 0 -azidoddGTP analog required to inhibit the formation of final product by 50% was calculated using nonlinear regression analyses (<rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dd70cb48f4-software-2">SigmaPlot</rs> Software Version <rs corresp="#dd70cb48f4-software-2" resp="#annotator26" type="version">11</rs>, <rs corresp="#dd70cb48f4-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Systat Software, Inc</rs>., San Jose, CA, USA) from at least three independent experiments. Two-tailed homoscedastic t-tests were used to calculate the reported P-values.</p>
            <p>Pre-steady-state incorporation of 6-modified-3 0 -azido-ddGTP analogs A rapid quench instrument (Kintek RQF-3 instrument, Kintek Corporation, Clarence, PA, USA) was used for pre-steady-state experiments. The typical experiment was performed at 37 C in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 and varying concentrations of nucleotide. All concentrations reported refer to the final concentrations after mixing. HIV-1 RT (200 nM) was pre-incubated with 20 nM T/P substrate, prior to rapid mixing with nucleotide and divalent metal ions to initiate the reaction that was quenched with 50 mM EDTA. The sequences of the template and 5 0 -radiolabeled primer are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The quenched samples were then mixed with an equal volume of gel loading buffer and products were separated from substrates as described above. The disappearance of substrate (20mer) and the formation of product (21-mer) were quantified using a Bio-Rad GS525 Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). Data were fitted by nonlinear regression with <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dd70cb48f4-software-3">Sigma Plot</rs> software (<rs corresp="#dd70cb48f4-software-3" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Systat Software, Inc</rs>., San Jose, CA, USA) using the appropriate equations <ref type="bibr">(9)</ref>. The apparent burst rate constant (k obs ) for each particular concentration of dNTP was determined by fitting the time courses for the formation of product (21mer) using the following equation: [21mer] = A[1 &#192; exp(&#192;k obs t)], where A represents the burst amplitude. The turnover number (k pol ) and apparent dissociation constant for dNTP (K d ) were then obtained by plotting the apparent catalytic rates (k obs ) against dNTP concentrations and fitting the data with the following hyperbolic equation: k obs = (k pol [dNTP])/([dNTP]+K d ). Catalytic efficiency was calculated as the ratio of turnover number over dissociation constant ([k pol /K d ]). Selectivity for natural dNTP versus 6-modified-3 0 -azido-ddGTP analog was calculated as the ratio of catalytic efficiency of dNTP over that of the 6-modified-3</p>
            <p>Molecular models of incorporation were constructed using the X-ray crystallographic coordinates (PDB entry 1 RTD) for the RT-T/P-TTP ternary complex <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref>. The 3 0 -OH of the primer strand as well as the 6-modified-3 0 -azido-2 0 ,3-ddGTP analogs and complementary bases in the template strand were built into the model to generate a pre-initiation complex, as described previously <ref type="bibr">(11)</ref>. Tautomerization and protonation potential of the entire system was calculated using the Generalized Born/Volume Integral (GB/VI) electrostatics method of Labute <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref>. Energy gradient minimization was carried out using MMFF94x force field in the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dd70cb48f4-software-30">Molecular Operating Environment (MOE</rs> <rs corresp="#dd70cb48f4-software-30" resp="#curator" type="version">2008.02</rs>; <rs corresp="#dd70cb48f4-software-30" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Chemical Computing Group</rs>, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Ligand interactions were quantified and images generated using the LigX interaction function in <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dd70cb48f4-software-simple-11">MOE</rs>. Structural models comparing incorporation and excision of specific nucleotide analogs used the PDB co-ordinates 3KLF and 3KLE that contain the excision product AZT adenosine dinucleoside tetraphosphate (AZTppppA) <ref type="bibr">(13)</ref>. To eliminate the potential force field bias from alignment of bases, empirically derived angle relations were used for all analogs tested. 3KLF and 3KLE were fit to the p66 subunit of 1RTD using the Matchmaker function in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="dd70cb48f4-software-4">Chimera</rs> version <rs corresp="#dd70cb48f4-software-4" resp="#annotator26" type="version">1.51</rs> (<rs corresp="#dd70cb48f4-software-4" resp="#curator" type="publisher">UCSF Chimera, Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California</rs>, San Francisco). Aligned structures were opened in <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dd70cb48f4-software-simple-15">MOE</rs> and dihedral angles were measured from bases relative to the ribose ring O and C1 of both template and bound nucleotides for each complex. <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dd70cb48f4-software-simple-16">MOE</rs>'s builder function was used to modify each template/bound nucleotide base pair retaining the experimental dihedrals.

            <p>Several systems propose a solution to automate the access to bioinformatics resources.

In contrast with these tools which focus on the execution of programs, and where the users can often interactively chain analyses, <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-50">GBrowse MOBY</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Wilkinson, 2006)</ref> and <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-10">Seahawk</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Gordon and Sensen, 2007b)</ref> propose data-centric solutions where the user can explore a set of <rs cert="0.5" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-11">BioMOBY</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Wilkinson, 2004)</ref> services to analyse a set of given data, with edition, navigation and visualization components which fully exploit the composite nature of <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-12">BioMOBY</rs> objects.</p>
            <p>Standalone workflow systems such as <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-13">Taverna</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Oinn et al., 2004)</ref>, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-14">Kepler</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Altintas et al., 2004)</ref> or <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-15">BioSide</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Hallard et al., 2004)</ref> enable to combine tools within desktop applications, using graphically specified workflows. It is hence possible, for bioinformaticians, to organize and automate complex data processing. Such possibilities have also been offered on web interfaces, either in dedicated systems such as <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-16">Remora</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Carrere and Gouzy, 2006)</ref>, or within some of the web-based systems cited above. <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-17">PISE</rs>, <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-18">Galaxy</rs> and <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-19">BioExtract</rs> also offer the possibility to save interactively designed protocols.</p>
            <p>Many of these systems now offer the possibility of accessing distributed resources, often using dedicated web-service solutions such as <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-20">BioMOBY</rs> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-21">SoapLab</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Senger et al., 2003)</ref>. While <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-22">SoapLab</rs> offers a system to automate the distribution of asynchronous analytical services, the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-23">BioMOBY</rs> protocol provides in addition more detailed descriptions, including semantic metadata and a registration system to facilitate the discovery of relevant resources. A number of tools facilitates the publication and management of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-24">BioMOBY</rs> services, such as <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-60">MoSeS</rs> (<rs corresp="#a5c2e682e4-software-60" resp="#curator" type="url">http:// biomoby.open-bio.org/CVS_CONTENT/moby-live/Java/docs/ Moses-generators.html</rs>) and the  <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-1">BioMOBY dashboard</rs> (<rs corresp="#a5c2e682e4-software-1" resp="#curator" type="url">http:// biomoby.open-bio.org/CVS_CONTENT/moby-live/Java/docs/ Dashboard.html</rs>). Many of the existing user interfaces rely on the descriptions provided by these systems to generate user interfaces: Ajax Command Definition from <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-29">EMBOSS</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Rice et al., 2000)</ref>, <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-30">BioMOBY</rs> or even pure WSDL definitions.</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-31">Mobyle</rs> is a generic web-based framework. While including advanced technologies such as web services, remote execution and dataflow mechanisms, it addresses major end-user concerns arising from the use of sophisticated bioinformatics systems. A recent study <ref type="bibr">(Gordon and Sensen, 2007a)</ref> shows how simple issues in the user interface can impede the use of a system by scientists, causing them to waste time and even preventing them from using it further. To address this issue, the design of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-32">Mobyle</rs>'s interface is user-centered, to provide a usable yet customizable access to a large panel of services, from genome analysis to structural bioinformatics. The description language it uses to generate user interfaces is sufficiently extensive and flexible for rich user interfaces to be generated. Its core partly relies on concepts previously embedded in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-33">PISE</rs> and the RPBS portal <ref type="bibr">(Alland et al., 2005)</ref>. Moreover, different <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-34">Mobyle</rs> servers can be federated to integrate services distributed over various sites. This functionality enables the federation of a network of curated portals, combining the skills of each of them. The <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-35">Mobyle</rs> program description language also enables to define web services, as shown by the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-36">PlayMOBY Mobyle companion tool</rs>, which automates the publication of <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-37">BioMOBY</rs> web services, and has monitoring capabilities that provide the bases for service quality monitoring.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-38">Mobyle</rs> design process was based on a user-centered design process <ref type="bibr">(Javahery et al., 2004; Letondal and Amanatian, 2004; Shachak et al., 2007)</ref>, involving numerous interviews and a number of users workshops (see Section 4.1). We identified the major end-user concerns that needed to be addressed:</p>
            <p>In this section, we provide an overview of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-39">Mobyle</rs>. We describe the underlying concepts of the system, the design of the web user interface, the server components and the distributed architecture.</p>
            <p>One of the shortcomings of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-69">PISE</rs> environment is its lack of support for a persistent user workspace <ref type="bibr">(Gilbert, 2002</ref>). The new system, while still allowing a fast and temporary 'guest' access to the programs, also gives to the users the possibility to create registered accounts, which allows user data and jobs to be maintained and managed across multiple work sessions.</p>
            <p>Based on feedback from <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-41">PISE</rs> server administrators, as well as the need to extend the capacity of functionalities such as web service wrapping or workflow management, we modified the schema that describes the system. All <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-42">Mobyle</rs> data, including program descriptions, job definitions and user workspaces are stored in XML documents. The main element of the system, the program description, is inherited from the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-43">PISE</rs> system. It describes various aspects, in a language that targets simplicity as much as possible (experience shows that the authoring and maintenance of program descriptions is a complex and tedious task). Aspects covered include:</p>
            <p>&#8226; <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-44">BioMoby</rs> integration: the XML files can be enriched with metadata such as <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-45">BioMoby</rs> parameter types, which permits the publication of a program as a <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-46">BioMoby</rs> service using<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-47">PlayMOBY</rs> (see Section 3.6).</p>
            <p>A formal description of the XML grammar used to describe<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-73">Mobyle</rs> programs is available on the project webpage (see <rs corresp="#a5c2e682e4-software-73" resp="#curator" type="url">http:// bioweb2.pasteur.fr/projects/mobyle/downloads.html</rs>), using Relax NG <ref type="bibr">(Clark et al., 2001)</ref>.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-50">Mobyle</rs> system aims at acting as a 'hub' for a set of programs of interest. A program integrated in <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-51">Mobyle</rs> can not only be local but also remote, using the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-52">Mobyle</rs> Net functionality (further described in Section 3.5). Additionally, current and future developments aim at providing gateways to web-service-based systems such as <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-53">BioMOBY</rs> (see Section 3.6). The interest is to provide a unified framework for bioinformatics platforms maintainers, who have to publish and integrate various local or remote programs for both biologists and bioinformaticians.</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-54">Mobyle</rs> provides the scientist with a global and integrated view of all the elements needed to perform his or her analyses. At one glance, the user can see which programs are available and which analyses have already been run. The portal is organized in three main parts <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>: a left navigation panel, a central panel displaying a selection of elements of the current work, such as forms and results, and horizontal tabs enabling the user to navigate between these elements.</p>
            <p>A major aspect of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-55">Mobyle</rs> is its capacity to facilitates automated data conversion and formatting for service integration, thus saving the user from tedious and non-scientific data manipulation tasks. The<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-56">Mobyle</rs> typing system describes program parameters using a typing mechanism that aims to help users in such tasks. It modifies the interface display, the controls for user values (the input parameters), the possibility of chaining between programs and data reusability.</p>
            <p>Similarly to <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-80">SWAMI</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Rifaieh et al., 2007)</ref>, data and parameter characterization is multidimensional:</p>
            <p>In contrast with other typing systems, such as the one offered by <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-58">BioMOBY</rs>, the parameter compatibility between two tasks is based on a more abstract description. Since the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-59">Mobyle</rs> system can convert the data to the format which is accepted by the next task, there is no need to have service interoperability rely on a bioinformatics format description. For instance, in the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-60">Mobyle</rs> Pasteur server,the user can align a set of protein sequences using the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-61">clustalwmultialign interface</rs>, then pipe the clustalw-formatted result to<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-62">Phylip</rs> protdist: although this program only accepts <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-63">Phylip</rs>-formatted multiple alignments, the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-64">squizz</rs> program, which handles sequence and alignment conversions, will automatically detect and convert the multiple alignment into the accepted format. This approach simplifies the construction of the protocol: the user does not have to specify data transformation tasks, allowing optimal handling of the data (the format conversion information is directly accessible in the job result page). This typing system is configurable and relies on a 'best-effort' approach. Tasks such as format detection or conversion are handled by the system only if they are compatible with the local configuration.</p>
            <p>This feature underlies the difference in what is considered to be a 'service' between <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-65">Mobyle</rs> and <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-66">BioMOBY</rs>: in <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-67">Mobyle</rs>, data format conversions should be, as far as possible, considered as mere connectors in the analysis dataflow, whereas in <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-68">BioMOBY</rs> they are considered to be on the same level as other analysis programs. Furthermore, since some programs accept multiple data formats as inputs, publishing them in <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-69">BioMOBY</rs> involves registering multiple services on the registry (one per accepted format), whereas they are published as a single 'interface' in <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-70">Mobyle</rs>.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-71">Mobyle</rs> server, based on a set of python modules, handles the various aspects of job, data and session managements. The most important of these, job submission, includes:</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-72">Mobyle</rs> network allows the execution of programs that are available on different <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-73">Mobyle</rs> servers from a single portal. This feature facilitates user access to services physically distributed over different <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-74">Mobyle</rs> servers, within an integrated environment enabling data reuse and program chaining. As opposed to <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-75">BioMOBY</rs>, <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-76">Mobyle</rs> does not provide any central repository to register new services, relying instead on a distributed registration: each <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-77">Mobyle</rs> server administrator chooses to publish a number of services, which can be upon his choice exported to or imported from remote <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-78">Mobyle</rs> servers. Remote program invocation relies on the import of the remote program XML descriptions. Upon submission, this allows to generate a call to the remote server instead of generating and submitting a local batch call. In such a configuration, the user workspace, as well as the local jobs, remain stored on the initial server, but remotely invoked jobs are directly linked from their execution servers <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4)</ref>. We demonstrate the use of this facility for the easy comparative modelling of the structure of a protein identified from analysis of the sunflower genome. A step by step tutorial is available on the MobyleNet help pages (http://mobyle.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/ help/MobyleTutorials_network.html). This task can be broken down into several successive steps: inferring protein sequence from the genomic information, performing a search for a template structure, fitting the query sequence to the template and then generating a 3D model. Protein sequence inference can currently be performed through the LIPM <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-79">Mobyle</rs> server, using the heliagene resource dedicated to sunflower genomic information. The next steps can be achieved through the RPBS <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-80">Mobyle</rs> server using a two pass blast (PDBblast service) to identify candidate template structures from the query sequence. Sequence alignment can be performed through the Institut Pasteur <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-81">Mobyle</rs> server using the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-82">clustalw</rs> service. Finally, the 3D modelling and model visualization/analysis can be performed through the RPBS site <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>. The <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-83">Mobyle</rs> network allows efficient organization of the complete sequence of tasks as a pipeline, without having to leave the RPBS <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-84">Mobyle</rs> portal, but making use of the resources and services at the three sites.</p>
            <p><rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-85">PlayMOBY</rs> is an external <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-86">Mobyle</rs> companion tool allows the publication of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-87">BioMOBY</rs>-compliant web services, using <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-88">Mobyle</rs> program descriptions. From the same XML description, bioinformatics programs can thus be both published on the<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-89">Mobyle</rs> network and used by the code generator of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-90">PlayMOBY</rs> in order to implement, register and validate <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-91">BioMOBY</rs> web services automatically. <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-92">PlayMOBY</rs> also integrates a perl library to generate the corresponding <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-93">Mobyle</rs> XML description file from program parameters. Thus, <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-94">PlayMOBY</rs> reduces the overheads of publishing <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-95">BioMOBY</rs> web services. To date, <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-96">PlayMOBY</rs> handles more than 100 <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-97">BioMOBY</rs> web services for providing generic sequence analysis tools and ensuring the interoperability of specialized databases (http://www.legoo.org, http://www.heliagene .org and http://narcisse.toulouse.inra.fr).</p>
            <p>In addition to web service deployment, <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-98">PlayMOBY</rs> provides daily monitoring tools for the deployed web services. During the<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-99">Mobyle</rs> to <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-100">PlayMOBY</rs> format conversion step, a service developer can provide a test dataset for each service input. These data are used to test web services availability and consistency by the provider himself. We made the choice to not allow web services users to launch these tests, which are instead automatically launched.</p>
            <p>The tests consist in verifying accessibility to the web service and consistency and stability of the results on test data. Their results are published as XML reports and RSS feeds. The <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-101">PlayMOBY</rs> description for the QoS presently follows the specifications stated by the BioWorkflow group <ref type="bibr">(Wessner et al., 2008)</ref>. However, it could easily be extended to other frameworks such as the BioCatalogue project <ref type="bibr">(Belhajjame et al., 2008)</ref>. In the case of failures or unexpected results, alerts are sent by e-mail to the developers. Thus,<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-102">PlayMOBY</rs> also provides the framework to evaluate <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-103">Mobyle</rs> service reliability and curation. This problem is particularly important in bioinformatics, given the volatility of tools (especially web-based), impairing the reliability of biological data processing.</p>
            <p>The Institut Pasteur, RPBS and LIPM <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-104">Mobyle</rs> servers have been publicly available since January 2008, October 2008 and January 2009, respectively. The Pasteur server provides access to a wide range of bioinformatics tools mainly focused on sequence analysis and phylogeny; the LIPM server offers access to tools related to plant genomics; and the RPBS server publishes programs that mainly concern structural bioinformatics. Over 400 000 jobs have already been submitted by over 40 000 different users throughout the world on these servers.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-105">Mobyle</rs> project arose from the natural evolution of software such as <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-106">PISE</rs>, offering a simple way to publish and to share bioinformatics software on the Web. Program chaining is limited to the most common usage patterns that we identified, and does not provide any of the advanced workflow patterns included in previously described systems (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-107">Taverna</rs>, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-108">Kepler</rs>). It is not either intended to handle analyses of very large quantities of data, data transfer over the network being too costly for web-based applications.</p>
            <p>&#8226; the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-109">Mobyle</rs> network enables the integration of local software with remote services, reducing the costs associated with the local maintenance of an exhaustive list of programs. Application of this strategy over several <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-110">Mobyle</rs> sites should help to connect providers, generating a framework that emcompasses a wide spectrum of applications and covers complementary aspects of bioinformatics. This strategy needs to be tested for a large number of sites; however, we anticipate the generation of a confidence network combining specific tools offered by each platform and thus promoting quality management of the services.</p>
            <p>&#8226; deployment of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-111">BioMOBY</rs> web services from bioinformatics programs is made available through <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-112">PlayMOBY</rs>. It thus benefits from the conceptual strength of the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-113">BioMOBY</rs> architecture, while avoiding the duplication of wrapper authoring effort, using a common format for both <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-114">Mobyle</rs> and <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-115">BioMOBY</rs> publications. Additionally, it encourages good practices such as services monitoring by integrating the design of tests into the publication process.</p>
            <p>Workflows and protocols: <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-116">Mobyle</rs> already embeds a prototype dataflow-oriented workflow engine, enabling the chaining of successive or parallel tasks to be automated. It runs on top of the<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-117">Mobyle</rs> core library, exploiting the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-118">Mobyle</rs> network to execute tasks distributed between local and remote servers, and orchestrates the tasks to synchronize their execution with the availability of all their input data. <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-119">Mobyle</rs> workflows modelize a set of tasks, but in contrast with existing workflow languages such as SCUFL in <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-120">Taverna</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Oinn et al., 2004)</ref> or MoML in <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-121">Kepler</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Altintas et al., 2004)</ref>, do not specify explicitly some low-level data format detection and transformation tasks. Authors are, whenever possible according to local configuration, not asked to specify these steps. Hence, the storage of workflow definitions is planned to be based on an extension of the current <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-122">Mobyle</rs> XML language, as they are based on a higher level perspective on the analyses they describe. An interesting outcome is the possibility to save an interactively designed program chaining as a reusable composite service. This perspective provides a gateway towards the publication of useracknowledged protocols on a community-based platform such as myexperiment.org <ref type="bibr">(De Roure et al., 2007)</ref>. Future end-user access to the workflow definitions and workflow engine will be integrated to the current web interface.</p>
            <p>Web services: the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-123">PlayMOBY</rs> system already allows the automated publication of <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-124">BioMOBY</rs> web services using <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-125">Mobyle</rs> program definitions. Future work also includes enabling the use of other approaches such as custom SOAP or REST interfaces, and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-126">SoapLab</rs>. Enabling the integration of such services as remote programs, for which the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-127">Mobyle</rs> Web Portal acts as a client will also be considered.</p>
            <p>Didactic tutorials: further developments will encompass the design of tutorials. As explained by <ref type="bibr">Cattley and Arthur (2007)</ref>, integrated web portals are a very efficient learning and teaching tool.<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-128">Mobyle</rs> additionally provides technical support for implementing interactive tutorials. A major issue to be incorporated in its design is to make more interactive components available: as shown by user studies, workflows should be available as semi-automatic protocols, with interactive components enabling the biologist to customize the visualization of the result from an analysis (e.g. a 3D molecule or an alignment).</p>
            <p>The design of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5c2e682e4-software-simple-129">Mobyle</rs>, which provides an effective way to make a large panel of curated bioinformatics tools available in a homogeneous environment, has been driven with the concern to meet the requirements of different audiences-biologists and bioinformaticians, mostly. Our objective was thus to facilitate the access to complex features and advanced technologies by a design</p>

            <p>For fluorescence immunocytology, cells were grown on glass coverslips, incubated as described in the figure legends, fixed in ice-cold methanol at &#161;20 C for 5 min and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Sigma, D8537). Samples were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma, A7906) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature (RT) before overnight incubation with primary antibodies in blocking buffer at 4 C. Following PBS washes samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488/ 568 goat anti-rabbit (H C L) or anti-mouse (H C L) secondary antibodies (1:500; Invitrogen, A-11034 and A-11031) for 1 h at RT. DNA was stained with DAPI (1 mg/mL; Sigma, D8417) before mounting coverslips with ProLong &#210; Gold antifade mounting medium (Life Technologies, P36930).

Protein concentration was quantitated using the bicinchoninic acid method (Sigma-Aldrich). Antibodies used in overnight incubations were anti-AIM-1 1:400 (611082; BD Bioscience), anti-LEM4 <ref type="figure">(1:2000)</ref>, and anti-GFP <ref type="bibr">(Yavuz et al., 2010)</ref>.

            <p>Live-cell microscopy was at 37&#176;C in CO 2 -independent medium without phenol red (Invitrogen). A Zeiss 780 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 63&#215; PlanApochromat, numerical aperture (NA) 1.4 oil objective was used to acquire 512 &#215; 512 pixel images with a pixel size of 0.439 &#956;m at 5-min intervals. The z-stacks of eight slices spaced equally through 22.4 &#956;m were acquired and formed into maximum-intensity z-projections.

            <p>The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-11">DIANA-microT</rs> web server v<rs corresp="#e0f8a9f552-software-11" resp="#annotator3" type="version">4.0</rs> (6) is focused on providing in silico predictions of miRNA-mRNA interactions. It is characterized by a user-friendly interface and provides extensive information for predicted miRNA-target gene interactions such as a global score for each interaction, as well as detailed information for all predicted target sites. Each target site can be visualized, and the user can examine its local prediction score, target site conservation and miRNA-mRNA binding structure. The server also provides connectivity to online biological databases and offers links to nomenclature, sequence and protein databases.</p>
            <p>Here, we present <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-12">DIANA-microT</rs> web server v<rs corresp="#e0f8a9f552-software-12" resp="#annotator3" type="version">5.0</rs>, a significantly updated version, which hosts the state-ofthe-art target prediction algorithm, <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-simple-4">DIANA-microT-CDS</rs> <ref type="bibr">(7)</ref>. microT-CDS is the only algorithm available online, specifically designed to identify miRNA targets both in 3 0 untranslated region (3 0 UTR) and in coding sequences (CDS). The new server detects miRNA targets in mRNA sequences of Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster and C.elegans. Furthermore, it has been updated to miRBase v18 <ref type="bibr">(8)</ref> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-13">Ensembl</rs> v<rs corresp="#e0f8a9f552-software-13" resp="#annotator3" type="version">69</rs> <ref type="bibr">(9)</ref>.

On the other hand, online help, informative tooltips and easy-to-use menus minimize the learning curve of new users. The fifth version of the<rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-simple-9">DIANA-microT</rs> web server focuses also on advanced users and laboratories requiring support for sophisticated pipelines. The server provides programmatic access to services of multiple <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-simple-10">DIANA</rs> algorithms and a complete integration with the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-simple-11">Taverna Workflow Management System</rs> (WMS) (10), using the in-house developed <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-simple-12">DIANA-Taverna Plug-in</rs>. Furthermore, a new section of the web interface hosts ready-made advanced workflows that can perform extensive miRNA-related analyses on results derived from high-throughput techniques, such as microarrays or Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS).</p>
            <p><rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-simple-13">DIANA-microT</rs> server has been updated to miRBase v18 and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-18">Ensembl</rs> v<rs corresp="#e0f8a9f552-software-18" resp="#annotator3" type="version">69</rs>. The server is compatible with the new miRNA nomenclature (3p/5p) introduced in miRBase v18, as well as with previous miRNA naming conventions. It currently supports 7.3 &#194; 10 6 H.sapiens, 3.5 &#194; 10 6 M.musculus, 4.4 &#194; 10 5 D.melanogaster and 2.5 &#194; 10 5 C.elegans interactions between 3876 miRNAs and 64 750 protein-coding genes. Gene (9) and miRNA (13) expression annotation has been incorporated into the web server, enabling the user to perform advanced result filtering based on tissue expression. Furthermore, users can also restrict predictions between uploaded lists of expressed genes and/or miRNAs. For example, this feature can be used to identify interactions between a list of repressed (or overexpressed) genes and overexpressed (or repressed) miRNAs, in the case of a differential expression analysis pipeline. Moreover, the web server hosts an updated version of the KEGG database providing a relevant search module based on KEGG pathway descriptions <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref>. A redesigned optional user space has also been implemented, which provides personalized features and facilitates the interconnectivity between the web server and the available <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-simple-16">DIANA</rs> software and databases <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>).</p>
            <p>As high-throughput data have become the new backbone of biological research, there is an increasing need to support advanced high-throughput analysis pipelines. The new <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-simple-17">DIANA-microT</rs> web server aims to facilitate users, not having access to extensive computational infrastructures and support, to perform ready-to-use sophisticated pipelines.</p>
            <p><rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-24">DIANA-microT</rs> web server v<rs corresp="#e0f8a9f552-software-24" resp="#annotator3" type="version">5.0</rs> hosts numerous integrated analyses in the form of ready-made advanced pipelines, covering a wide range of inquiries regarding predicted or validated miRNA-gene interactions and their impact on metabolic and signalling pathways. These pipelines can be used to analyse user data derived from small scale and high-throughput experiments directly from the<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-simple-20">DIANA-microT</rs> web server interface, without the necessity to install or implement any kind of software.</p>
            <p>The prediction score threshold can significantly affect the analysis steps that follow. In the case of predicted interactions, the pipeline can be optimized by automatic repetitions of different prediction thresholds (from sensitive to more stringent), to minimize the effect of the selected settings to the result. By using meta-analysis statistics, the server combines the P-values from each repetition into a total P-value for each miRNA, signifying its effect on the selected genes for all used thresholds <ref type="bibr">(15,16)</ref>. In the last step of the pipeline, the identified miRNAs are subjected to a functional analysis, where pathways controlled by the combined action of these miRNAs are detected using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-27">DIANA-miRPath</rs> v<rs corresp="#e0f8a9f552-software-27" resp="#annotator3" type="version">2.1</rs> <ref type="bibr">(16)</ref>.</p>

Furthermore, the plug-in enables the extension of such pipelines through the use of other <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-simple-34">DIANA</rs> tools and databases, providing access to the most extensive collection of validated miRNA targets (DIANA-TarBase v6.0) and to <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-37">DIANA-miRPath</rs> v<rs corresp="#e0f8a9f552-software-37" resp="#annotator3" type="version">2.1</rs>, a tool designed for the identification of miRNA targeted pathways.

            <p>High-throughput techniques have significantly increased the number of users requiring in-depth analysis ofmiRNA-mRNA interactions. These techniques provide great numbers of differentially expressed miRNAs and genes, which have to be analysed in sophisticated pipelines. The new <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-simple-37">DIANA-microT</rs> web server aims to further increase the target prediction accuracy and usability of the server interface, while facilitating users aiming to perform complex miRNA-related analyses.</p>

The <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-simple-40">Taverna Plug-in</rs> and the integration of cutting-edge workflows in the web interface provide the missing link between experimental results and state-of-the-art functional meta-analyses.Flowchart depicting an analysis pipeline directly available from the web server interface. Interactions between user-defined miRNA and gene sets are in silico identified in 3 0 UTR and CDS regions using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e0f8a9f552-software-simple-41">DIANA-microT-CDS</rs>. A subsequent miRNA target enrichment analysis identifies miRNAs controlling significantly the sets of differentially expressed genes.

            <p>Small villages (having less than 1,000 inhabitants) are merged with adjacent villages that are more similar in terms of adult education and economic status. After merging the small villages, we are left with 90 villages (or clusters) for analysis. GIS of the HDSS generates spatial data: geo-coordinates of each bari (group of households that share a common yard and whose heads are usually related by blood) and land marks (tube-wells, health facilities, schools, markets, mosques and temples) in degree decimal format. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="ba8a29bc3c-software-simple-0">ArcGIS</rs> software is used to create a polygon of each village and to pick the centroid (defined by the centre of gravity). In case of centroidsKulldorff et al. <ref type="bibr">(5, 6)</ref> have extended the spatial scan statistic into a space&#193;time scan statistic to identify spatial and temporal units with high mortality risks. In this study, we used Kulldorff's space&#193;time scan statistic, which takes into consideration spatial and temporal distributions of the population as follows. The window imposed on the HDSS area is cylindrical with a circular geographic base and with height corresponding to time. The centre of the base is one of several possible centroids located throughout the HDSS area and the height reflects any possible time interval. The cylindrical window is then moved in space and time and it allows the centre of the circular geographic base to move across the HDSS villages. For any given position of the centre, the radius of the circular base changes continuously so that it can take any value between zero and an upper limit of 50% of the total population. A village is captured if it lies in the circular base. Therefore, the circular base is able to include a different set of neighbouring villages. This scanning was applied to HDSS data for the time window 1998&#193;2007 to scan for space and time with high mortality rates.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="ba8a29bc3c-software-simple-1">SaTScan</rs> TM option 'purely temporal analysis' showed a significantly higher mortality in 1998&#193;2002 compared to 2003&#193;2007 <ref type="table">(Table 1</ref>). An alternative analysis using Poisson regression showed a highly significant (pB 0.001) linear mortality decline over the full period 1998&#193; 2007.</p>
            <p>Identifying clusters with high mortality risks is a first step in prioritising areas for analysis of cause and planning of remedial actions. Space&#193;time analysis using Kulldorff's method (6) identified two clusters of villages with high mortality risks in 1998&#193;2002. This reveals that mortalitydecline was faster in the high-risk clusters than in the average-risk cluster and achieved equity. A common drawback of Kulldorff's method is that clusters are defined as circles or cylindrical windows with circular base (5, 6). Actual clusters (or villages) are irregular in shape. This feature has some implications for the interpretation of the results. If a village with low mortality is surrounded by villages with high mortality, it is included in the cluster although some characteristics of the village are different from other villages. If clustering of mortality is, say, along the river, then a circular shape is not appropriate to detect it. The first limitation is similar to that of the control trial cohort, and the overall effect on the result would be small. The second limitation can be minimised by viewing an<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="ba8a29bc3c-software-simple-2">ArcGIS</rs> map. Each high-risk cluster comprises a set of adjacent villages. The most likely mortality cluster consists of 22 villages adjacent to each other. They are in close proximity of the big river, the 'Meghna', and are exposed to more natural disasters such as river erosion and monsoon flooding. The secondary cluster consists of 18 villages on the banks of the rivers Gumti and Dhonogoha and in adjacent low-lying areas. These villages are remote &#193; far away from the sub-district town and health facility. What causes difference in mortality between clusters demands in-depth study.</p>

            <p>Fluorescence intensity in PR was rigorously and reproducibly quantified in an unbiased manner as previously described <ref type="bibr">(63)</ref>. Individual colour channel images were taken using a Leica microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH). TIFF images were gray-scaled with image analysis software (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="af9ad5f83b-software-1">LAS AF lite</rs>; <rs corresp="#af9ad5f83b-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Leica Microsystems GmbH</rs>). Six images of each eye were analyzed at 20&#215; magnification by a masked observer. The PR (outer nuclear layer + OS) were selectively outlined in every image, and the total fluorescence for the enclosed area was calculated in an unbiased manner using the image analysis software. The fluorescence in PR was then averaged from six images collected from separate retinal sections from each eye. We then calculated the average fluorescence of the three eyes of each experimental group.</p>
            <p>For lipofuscin fluorescence analysis, eyes were harvested from pigmented Abca4+/&#8722; and Abca4&#8722;/&#8722; mice at 3 months after AAV injection. Mice were dark-adapted over-night and sacrificed under dim red-light. For each eye, four overlapping pictures from the temporal side of three sections at different levels of the eye were taken using a Leica DM5000B microscope equipped with a TX2 filter (excitation: 560 &#177; 40 nm; emission: 645 &#177; 75) <ref type="bibr">(64- 68)</ref> and under a 20&#215; objective. The four images for each section were then combined in a single montage used for further fluorescence analysis. Intensity of lipofuscin fluorescence (red signal) in each section was automatically calculated using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="af9ad5f83b-software-simple-2">ImageJ</rs> software and was then normalized for the length of the RPE underlying the area of fluorescence.</p>
            <p>For electron microscopy analyses eyes were harvested from albino Abca4&#8722;/&#8722; and Abca4+/+ mice at 3 months after AAV injection. Eyes were fixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde-2% PFA in 0.1 M PHEM buffer pH 6.9 (240 m&#63341; PIPES, 100 m&#63341; HEPES, 8 m&#63341; MgCl2, 40 m&#63341; EGTA) overnight and then rinsed in 0.1 M PHEM buffer. Eyes were then dissected under light microscope to select the tyrosinase-positive portions of the eyecups. The transduced portion of the eyecups were subsequently embedded in 12% gelatin, infused with 2.3 M sucrose and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cryosections (50 nm) were cut using a Leica Ultramicrotome EM FC7 (Leica Microsystems) and extreme care was taken to align PR connecting cilia longitudinally. To avoid bias in the attribution of morphological data to the various experimental groups, counts of lipofuscin granules were performed by a masked operator (Dr Roman Polishchuk) using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="af9ad5f83b-software-4">iTEM</rs> software (<rs corresp="#af9ad5f83b-software-4" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Olympus SYS</rs>, Hamburg, Germany). The 'Touch count' module of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="af9ad5f83b-software-simple-5">iTEM</rs> software was used to count the number of lipofuscin granules in 25 &#181;m 2 areas (at least 40) distributed randomly across the RPE layer. The granule density was expressed as number of granules per 25 &#181;m 2 .</p>

            <p>The UPLC-ESI-MS analysis was carried out using an Waters Acquity UPLC H-Class system operated with the Empower software (Milford, MA, USA) and AccuTOF &#174; single-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometer with an ESI operated using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="cfa546ccbc-software-1">Mass Center system</rs> version <rs corresp="#cfa546ccbc-software-1" resp="#annotator4" type="version">1.3.7b</rs> (<rs corresp="#cfa546ccbc-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">JEOL</rs>, Tokyo, Japan). The photodiode array (PDA) detector was recorded between 210-450 nm and the monitoring wavelength was set to 330 nm. The Brownlee SPP C18 column (2.1 mm&#215;75 mm i.d., 2.7 mm, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) used was placed in a column oven set at 25&#176;C. The KJ sample was dissolved in 15% acetonitrile to a final concentration of 30 mg/mL, filtered using a 0.2-mm PVDF filter, and then injected into the UPLC system with an injection volume of 1 mL and flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. The mobile phase was composed of a linear gradient of acetonitrile in H2O acidified with acetic acid (0.1%) and run as follows: 2-5% (0-2.5 min), 5-15% (2.5-10 min), 15-20% (10-15 min), 20-50% (15-25 min), 50-100% (25-27 min), 100% (27-37 min), and 100-2% (37-38 min). The operating parameters of the mass spectrometer were set as follows. In the negative ion mode, the needle electrode was set to 2000 V; nitrogen gas was used as the nebulizer and desolvating agent at flow rates of 1 and 3 L/min, respectively; and the desolvating chamber and orifice 1 temperatures were 250 and 80&#176;C, respectively. The atmospheric pressure interface potentials for the orifice 1, ring lens, and orifice 2 were 80, 10, 5 V, respectively. The mass scale calibration was performed using a Yokudelna calibration kit (JEOL) for ensuring accurate mass measurements while the scan range of the MS acquisition was set at m/z 100-2000.</p>

            <p>Mice. Four-to six-week-old NOD mice (male and female; Taconic Laboratories, Germantown, NY), female nonobese resistant (NOR) mice, male C57BL/6 mice, and female C57BL/10SnJ mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were used. Animals were housed in the barrier facility at the Institute for Cellular Therapeutics (Louisville, KY) and were cared for according to National Institutes of Health animal care guidelines. Antibodies. All monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) used in this study were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). c-Kit &#1001; Sca-1 &#1001; Lin &#1002; (HSC) sorting experiments used the following mAbs: stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1) phycoerythrin (PE), c-Kit allophycocyanin (APC), and the lineage panel consisting of the following: <ref type="bibr">CD</ref> <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref>. Briefly, bone marrow was isolated and collected in a single cell suspension at a concentration of 100 &#1003; 10 6 cells/ml in sterile cell sort media, containing sterile 1&#1003; Hank's balanced salt solution without phenol red, 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10 mmol &#8528; l &#1002;1 &#8528; ml &#1002;1 HEPES buffer, and 30 l/ml gentamicin (Gibco, Grand Island, NY). Directly labeled mAbs were added at saturating concentrations, and the cells were incubated for 30 min and washed with cell sort media. Phenotypic analysis of sorted CD8 &#1545; /TCR &#1546; FCs. Sorted FCs (purity was &#1350;95%) were incubated with Fc receptor block (anti-CD16/CD32) before staining with lineage-specific markers: anti-CD11 FITC, CD11b APC, CD14 FITC, NK1.1 FITC, DX5 FITC, B220 PerCP, Gr-1 APC, and CD19 APC, as previously described <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref>. Sorted FCs were analyzed for p-preDC FCs as B220 &#1001; /CD11c &#1001; /CD11b &#1002; using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="b63bae43ca-software-1">Cell Quest</rs> Software (<rs corresp="#b63bae43ca-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Becton Dickinson</rs>). DC maturation and cytokine production. FCs were cultured alone or with 1 mol/l TLR-9 ligand CpG-ODN 1668 (TCCATGACGTTCCGATGCT) (Gibco BRL Custom Primers) (13) for 18 h. Supernatants were assayed for cytokines by Linco Diagnostic (St Charles, MO) using LINCOplex Multiplex immunoassay, and cells were stained with anti-CD80, anti-CD86, or anti-MHC class II I-A d (39-10-8) FITC mAbs, with appropriately matched isotype controls. HSC and/or FC transplantation. In the syngeneic model, recipients were conditioned with 950 cGy total body irradiation (TBI) from a Cesium source (Nordion, ON, Canada) and transplanted with 500 HSCs &#1006; 30,000 FC populations by tail vein injection &#1350;6 h after irradiation <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref>. In the allogeneic model, recipients conditioned with 950 cGy TBI were transplanted with 5,000 HSCs &#1006; 30,000 FL-PB FCs (4). Colony-forming cell assay. HSCs were cultured at a 1:2 ratio with or without FCs in methylcellulose containing mouse growth factors (MethoCult GF M3434; StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) in duplicate at 37&#176;C in 5% CO 2 and a humidified atmosphere <ref type="bibr">(13)</ref>. After 14 days, colonies containing more than 50 cells were scored. Chimerism testing. Engraftment of donor cells was evaluated by PBL typing using three-color flow cytometry, as previously described <ref type="bibr">(15)</ref>. FC morphology. Wright-Giemsa staining was performed on cytospins of 100,000 FCs after being fixed in methanol. Slides were examined for dendritic morphology under optical microscopy. Statistical analysis. Experimental data were evaluated for significant differences using Student's t test; P &#1021; 0.05 was considered significant. Graft survival was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method (4).</p>

            <p>The primary end point hypothesis used for sample-size estimation was that combination therapy with gemcitabine and S-1 would increase the median PFS by 2 months (from 3 to 5 months) compared with gemcitabine monotherapy with a type I error probability of 5% (one-sided) and power of 80%. The required number of patients was 50 and a 5% dropout was accounted for in the sample-size calculation. The OS from randomisation was calculated from the date of randomisation to the date of death from any cause or censored at the last follow-up. The PFS was calculated from the date of randomisation to the date of either disease progression or death or censored at the last follow-up. The OS and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and were compared between treatment arms using the log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The ORRs were reported as best achieved response rates. Proportions between the arms were compared using the w 2 test or Fisher's test; quantitative variables were compared using Student's t-test or the Wilcoxon test. All analyses were conducted based on the intention-to-treat principle. Two-sided P-values o0.05 were considered to be significant. The final analysis was based on follow-up information, which was collected until February 2011. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="f9b171fb54-software-0">JMP</rs> <rs corresp="#f9b171fb54-software-0" resp="#annotator4" type="version">8.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#f9b171fb54-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SAS Institute Inc</rs>., Cary, NC, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.</p>

            <p>METHODS -This is a retrospective (Institutional Review Board approved) analysis of 810 days of CSII and CGM data from nine youth with diabetes. All subjects used the Minimed Paradigm REAL Time System (Northridge, CA) for insulin delivery and CGM. Reports were downloaded using <rs corresp="#abfc2d771b-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Medtronic</rs> <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="abfc2d771b-software-0">CareLink</rs> software. Afternoon snacks were identified on CGM as glucose excursions beginning between 1330 and 1700 h. A glucose excursion was considered resolved when glucose levels remained steady for &#1350;15 min. Glucose excursions with incomplete CGM data or CSII suspension &#1022;15 min were discarded. Glucose excursions were identified as a snack with no insulin (SNI) or a snack with insulin (SWI) as described below, and possible snacks not fitting these criteria were excluded from analysis. SNI criteria were as follows: 1) no bolus administered within &#1006;30 min of the beginning of the glucose excursion, 2) increase in glucose level &#1350;50 mg/dl, 3) average rate of change from baseline to peak of excursion &#1350;0.8 mg/dl per minute, 4) starting glucose level &#1022;80 mg/dl (to exclude treatment of hypoglycemia), and 5) determined not to be the dinner meal. Carbohydrate contents for snacks are not known for SNI.</p>

            <p>Using a large number of instruments may overfit endogenous variables and may weaken the Hansen J-test of the instruments' joint validity. To keep the number of instruments at a minimum, we use the collapse option in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="e5f17ad2f0-software-1">STATA</rs> in all regressions <ref type="bibr">(Roodman, 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> This ensures that the number of instruments is always well below the number of countries. Overall, the results, reported in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, are broadly in line with the fixed-effects results. The lagged dependent variable is always significant at the one percent level. Depending on the model specification, the estimated coefficient is slightly above or below one, implying no strong evidence for convergence in sub-Saharan African countries. This finding is in line with the results of McCoskey <ref type="formula">(2002)</ref>, who also found no convergence for economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa, although smaller "convergence clubs" do exist.</p>

            <p>Pharmacological groups were selected by using the following procedure: 1. All 89 Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) second level groups with drugs available on the Swedish market <ref type="bibr">17 18</ref> were identified. 2. In large ATC groups and ATC groups with drugs used for multiple heterogeneous indications, that is, cardiac therapy (C01), agents acting on the reninangiotensin system (C09), sex hormones (G03), urologicals (G04), analgesics (N02), psycholeptics (N05), psychoanaleptics (N06), ophthalmologicals (S01), a subdivision was done to the ATC third or fourth level to attain a more clinically relevant description of the utilisation. 3. ATC groups with less than 75% of the total sales volume in the country purchased on prescription were excluded since sex distribution was not possible to collect for those purchased over-the-counter or used in inpatient care. Volume was measured in the technical unit numbers of Defined Daily Doses (DDDs), except for eight pharmacological groups for which there were no DDDs assigned. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> For these groups, packages were used as a volume measure. Calculations of the proportion of the total volume dispensed as prescriptions in ambulatory care were based on aggregated volume data from all Swedish pharmacies. 4. For the identified ATC groups at various hierarchical levels, groups that were dispensed to less than 1% of the total Swedish population or to less than 0.4% of men or women, respectively, were excluded to avoid random variation due to small numbers. Crude and age-adjusted values were calculated. Age standardisation was performed by direct standardisation, where the Swedish population on 31 December 2009 (4 649 014 men and 4 691 668 women <ref type="bibr">19</ref>) was used as the standard population. In the calculations, 5-year age groups were used. Differences between the sexes were calculated as a risk ratio (RR) of women/men with 95% CI.

            <p>Currently, there exist three different predictors publicly available: <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-11">big-&#960;</rs> (15 ) from the <rs corresp="#a3d714f4f8-software-11" resp="#curator" type="publisher">University of Vienna</rs> (available in two versions, one for metazoa and one for protozoa), <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-12">DGPI</rs> from the <rs corresp="#a3d714f4f8-software-12" resp="#curator" type="publisher">University of Geneva</rs> (retrieved from <rs corresp="#a3d714f4f8-software-12" resp="#curator" type="url">http://129.194.185.165/ dgpi</rs>/), and the large-scale annotator <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-1">GPI-SOM</rs> <ref type="bibr">(16 )</ref> from the <rs corresp="#a3d714f4f8-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">University of Bern</rs>. The first two also predict potential cleavage sites while the third does not. These tools target the C-terminal and N-terminal signals of protein sequences, or require verifying the presence of the N-terminal signal before submitting sequences to the predictor. This affects automatically their performance in the presence of fragmented or partial sequences, which happen to be more and more common in databases. In particular, metagenome projects generate many fragmented sequences representing only partial proteins, complicating the annotation process. Moreover, with metagenome projects, the inability to relate many of the new sequences to a specific taxonomic group does not favor the use of a group-specific tool like <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-7">big-&#960;</rs>. Therefore, large-scale annotation tools, which are able to predict the presence of a particular motif at different levels of precision (that is, to assess each prediction in a qualitative way) with minimal information, are then needed to address this new reality, since tools that are too restrictive or specialized often lack the flexibility needed to make correct predictions. For example, a recent analysis of the P. falciparum proteome shows that <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-8">big-&#960;</rs>, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-9">DGPI</rs>, and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-10">GPI-SOM</rs> generated poor results in predicting proteins selected as biologically validated or highly probable candidates <ref type="bibr">(14 )</ref>. Accordingly, our system was designed to offer the precision of cleavage site prediction tools and the flexibility needed for a large-scale annotator in a noisy environment.</p>
            <p>We developed a system, called <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-11">FragAnchor</rs>, based on the tandem use of a neural network (NN) and a hidden Markov model (HMM). NN is used to select potential GPI-anchored sequences and HMM classifies the selected sequences by a qualitative scoring scheme. The sequences selected by NN are annotated as highly probable (Class 1), probable (Class 2), weakly probable (Class 3), or potential false positive (Class 4). HMM is also used to predict the position of the cleavage site in the sequence.</p>
            <p>In the test performed with 30 sequences of those proposed by Gilson et al <ref type="bibr">(14 )</ref> from the P. falciparum proteome, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-12">FragAnchor</rs> was able to predict 29 of them as GPI-anchored protein sequences (96.67%). However, it is interesting to note that 40% of these predictions were classified as potential false positive (Class 4).</p>
            <p>The tests with the two negative sets gave very good results as 96.80% and 93.79% of the sequences were rejected by NN, respectively, while HMM classified most of the incorrectly selected sequences as potential false positives. These examples illustrate the importance and usefulness of the qualitative scoring of the predictions of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-13">FragAnchor</rs>.</p>
            <p>The sequences of the four test sets described above were also submitted to two publicly available predictors of GPI-anchored proteins: <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-14">big-&#960;</rs> (15 ) and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-15">GPI- SOM</rs> (16 ) <ref type="table">Table 3)</ref>. We did not compare <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-16">FragAnchor</rs> with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-17">DGPI</rs> because the design of this tool makes large dataset analysis difficult. Since <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-18">big-&#960;</rs> and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-19">GPI-SOM</rs> require the use of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-20">SignalP</rs> <ref type="bibr">(18 )</ref> for the N-terminal signal peptide prediction, we included an evaluation of<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-21">FragAnchor</rs> combined with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-22">SignalP</rs> to help the comparison process. However, the use of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-23">SignalP</rs> is not required before using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-24">FragAnchor</rs>. Compared with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-25">big-&#960;</rs>, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-26">FragAnchor</rs> is more sensitive to the GPI-anchoring pattern even if we consider only the first three classes (highly probable, probable, and weakly probable). For the first set of 121 GPI-anchored sequences, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-27">FragAnchor</rs> correctly predicted 88.43% of them (82.64% in Classes 1-3) while <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-28">big-&#960;</rs> accepted 60.33%. For the newly analyzed P. falciparum sequences, as pointed out in Gilson et al <ref type="bibr">(14 )</ref>, most predictors failed to predict a significant number of sequences known to bear GPI anchor. In <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, we can see that <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-29">FragAnchor</rs> has a very high capacity of prediction with only one sequence wrongly predicted. Even when discarding the potential false positive sequences, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-30">FragAnchor</rs> recognizes more GPI-anchored sequences than <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-31">big-&#960;</rs> does. One of the reasons of the better performance of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-32">FragAnchor</rs> is the fact that it does not need the presence of the N-terminal signal, which is not clearly detectable in 6 of the 30 P. falciparum sequences.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-33">FragAnchor</rs> shows a lower capacity of discrimination for the negative sets when compared with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-34">big-&#960;</rs>, which is understandable due to the high stringency of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-35">big-&#960;</rs>. However, this high stringency is accompanied by a poor capacity of prediction for the GPI anchor signal. Nonetheless, we achieved a specificity of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-36">FragAnchor</rs> comparable to that of <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-37">GPI- SOM</rs> and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-38">big-&#960;</rs>. The specificity was computed by adding the proportions of the first three classes (Table 2), for example, for the cytoplasm and nuclear proteins, it is 0.21 + 0.16 + 0.27 = 0.64. For the membrane transport proteins, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-39">FragAnchor</rs> gave more false positive predictions. However, for this set of proteins, it is possible that some of them will eventually be validated as real GPI-anchored proteins in laboratory experiments.</p>
            <p>When compared with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-40">GPI-SOM</rs>, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-41">FragAnchor</rs> is more accurate. <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-42">GPI-SOM</rs> predicted fewer GPIanchored sequences from the first positive set of 121 sequences, with a prediction rate of 82.64% compared with 88.43% for <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-43">FragAnchor</rs>. It also failed to predict a significant number of the P. falciparum sequences with only 73.33% of correctly predicted GPI-anchored sequences. For the negative sets, the use of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-44">FragAnchor</rs> combined with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-45">SignalP</rs> showed that <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-46">FragAnchor</rs> achieved results close to <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-47">GPI-SOM</rs> (better for the first negative set, slightly lower for the second negative set).</p>
            <p>More interestingly, the analysis of P. falciparum GPI-anchored sequences showed that a large portion of the GPI-anchored sequences (40%) fell in the potential false positive prediction, proving the usefulness of keeping those potentially wrongly predicted sequences in a specific class. An analysis of the sequences rejected by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-48">GPI-SOM</rs> showed that 50% of them were found in the potential false positive class from <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-49">FragAnchor</rs>. In addition, the analysis result of P. falciparum sequences demonstrated that 4 of the 11 biochemically validated GPI-anchored sequences did not have an N-terminal signal peptide recognized by<rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-50">SignalP</rs>. This fact confirms the effectiveness of an annotation not based on the prediction of this signal. In short, the comparison with other tools is not easy due to the uniqueness of the tandem method. However, it reveals an interesting power of prediction where, in a single run, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-51">FragAnchor</rs> can have a very low number of potential false positive predictions with a much higher number of GPI-anchored sequences predicted.</p>
            <p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, we show an example of output from the tandem system (<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-52">FragAnchor</rs> predictor). NN first selects a protein sequence and then HMM parses the sequence in order to predict a potential cleavage site. The first predicted anchor site for that sequence (5NTD HUMAN) is at position 549. This is the position annotated in the Swiss-Prot database. In the output, the predictor proposes a maximum of three possible anchor sites, ranked by decreasing scores.</p>
            <p>The comparison of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-53">FragAnchor</rs> with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-54">big-&#960;</rs> and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-55">GPI- SOM</rs> shows that <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-56">FragAnchor</rs> can be used at different levels of precision, allowing a more selective prediction. In addition, it offers a high level of flexibility with respect to the organism considered. Studies like the P. falciparum proteome analysis by <ref type="bibr">Gilson et al (14 )</ref>, where the available predictors failed to predict the biochemically proposed new GPI-anchored proteins, show that there is a need for a more flexible and universal predictor. The flexibility and accuracy achieved by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-57">FragAnchor</rs> offer an excellent annotator for the GPI anchor signal designed for all metagenome projects.One of the main goals of this large-scale prediction tool is to offer greater flexibility to the users. We propose a tool that offers different levels of sensitivity to the GPI anchor signal. The tests reveal that the combination of the two machine learning approaches yields very good results. The tandem system is a very general (all eukaryotes) tool for the annotation of GPI-anchored proteins on a large scale by using minimal information. It produces prediction with a qualitative annotation allowing the user to choose the strength of precision that he/she wants. The less sensitive classes may contain sequences with unusual GPI anchor signals, which can yield to new discoveries in the PTM research area.</p>
            <p>The Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator (<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-64">javaNNS</rs> <rs corresp="#a3d714f4f8-software-64" resp="#annotator2" type="version">1.1</rs>) developed at the <rs corresp="#a3d714f4f8-software-64" resp="#curator" type="publisher">University of Stuttgart</rs> (<rs corresp="#a3d714f4f8-software-64" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www-ra.informatik.uni-tuebingen. de/downloads/JavaNNS</rs>/) was used to design and train our NN predictor. The learning set for this experiment is 79 sequences from the Swiss-Prot database release 49.0 that are annotated as GPIanchored proteins, with a length of the C-terminal section to be 50 a.a., and another 79 sequences of proteins that are known not to be GPI-anchored proteins. The choice of the length of the C-terminal section was based on an analysis of Swiss-Prot GPI-anchored proteins, which showed a maximum length of 45 a.a. for the C-terminal signal. To give some flexibility to the system, we selected an input vector of 50 a.a. Since neural networks accept numerical input, and given the importance of molecular weight and hydrophobicityin the anchoring process, we encoded each amino acid with its hydropathy on the Kyte and Doolitle scale <ref type="bibr">(21 )</ref>, as well as its molecular weight. The last step is the normalization of the input vectors. We have applied a simple min-max normalization:</p>

            <p>Sample size calculation. Sample size was determined on the basis of the data from <ref type="bibr">Kennedy and Scholey (2004)</ref>. Mean change-from-baseline rapid visual information processing accuracy scores were averaged across the 30-, 40-and 50-min post-treatment measures for the 40 g caffeine plus 68 g glucose and the placebo conditions, respectively. The resulting effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.372 was used to calculate the sample size for a four-condition analysis of variance (ANOVA) using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="a0d696e883-software-1">G*POWER</rs> v<rs corresp="#a0d696e883-software-1" resp="#annotator5" type="version">3.12</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Faul et al., 2007)</ref>. This generated an N of 132 to detect a significant difference at an &#945; level of 0.05 with 95% power. Given the exploratory nature of this study, and the possibility of attrition, the N was increased to 40/cell in order to optimise the chances of capturing treatment-related effects.</p>

            <p>All data files were transmitted to the bioinformatics data-processing lab for analysis after converting to the standard mzXML format <ref type="bibr">(32, 33)</ref> and then searched with <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-6">X! Tandem</rs> (<rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-6" resp="#annotator18" type="version">January 1, 2007</rs> release) configured with a scoring function (24) compatible with <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-2">Peptide- Prophet</rs> <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref> and <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-3">ProteinProphet</rs> <ref type="bibr">(26)</ref>. The same database (human IPI version 3.20 consisting of 61,225 IPI numbers) was used to search all data. <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-9">PeptideProphet</rs> (version <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-9" resp="#annotator18" type="version">3.0</rs>) and <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-10">ProteinProphet</rs> (version <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-10" resp="#curator" type="version">3.0</rs>) were used to assign identified peptide and protein confidence scores for all but Lab 1 (details described below) where the complexity of samples interrogated was not sufficient to estimate the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-8">PeptideProphet</rs> error model. Quantitation was performed following tryptic search and protein inference. Finally multiple experiments within a lab were then aligned to create analytic data sets sufficient to determine relative disease status.</p>
            <p>The following common criteria were applied to all searches. A &#1006;2.0-Da error from the calculated peptide monoisotopic mass was allowed to determine whether a particular peptide sequence is to be considered as a possible model for a spectrum. Mass tolerance for fragment ions was 1 Da <ref type="bibr">(24)</ref>. The maximal number of missed cleavages permitted was 2. A static modification on cysteines of &#1001;57.021 Da was used for all labs except Lab 4, which performed acrylamide labeling on cysteines. A potential modification on methionines of &#1001;15.9949 Da was used. A weighted average mass was used to calculate the masses of the fragment ions in a tandem mass spectrum. A minimum number of one ion was required for a peptide to be scored. A default minimum <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-9">PeptideProphet</rs> probability of 0.2 was used to calculate the protein group probability. Only peptides with probability &#1350;0.75 and mass error &#1021;20 ppm were selected for quantitation. Specific search parameters for the different labeling schemes by different labs are specified in the supplemental text, Part B. The following are descriptions of the software used for each lab's data and quantitation methods (summarized in supplemental <ref type="table">Table S</ref>2) during data processing.</p>
            <p>Lab 1-Lab 1 used a DIGE method and quantitated a large number of fluorescent spots with two commercial software algorithms (<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-12">DeCyder</rs> <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-12" resp="#annotator18" type="version">6.5</rs> (<rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-12" resp="#curator" type="publisher">GE Healthcare</rs>) and <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-13">SameSpots</rs> <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-13" resp="#annotator18" type="version">2.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-13" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Nonlinear Dynamics</rs>)). A t test was performed on the log ratios using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-14">Statistica</rs> for Windows (<rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-14" resp="#curator" type="publisher">StatSoft, Inc</rs>.) version <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-14" resp="#annotator18" type="version">7</rs> to estimate the significant difference of a protein. Only those spots found to have significant changes, based on fluorescence, between the HD and the control were selected for tandem MS analysis. Peak lists of MS/MS spectra acquired on the HCT-Ultra ion trap instrument (Bruker Daltonics) were generated using the software tool <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-15">DataAnalysis</rs> <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-15" resp="#annotator18" type="version">3.4.179</rs> (<rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-15" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Bruker Daltonics</rs>) with default parameters. The built-in algorithm version 2.0 was used, and neither smoothing nor any signal-to-noise filter was applied for compound detection. A maximum charge state of 3 was considered for deconvolution. Data were then converted to mzXML files using<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-16">CompassXport</rs> (version <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-16" resp="#annotator18" type="version">1.2.3</rs>). Peptides were identified using decoy database methods with an approach described by <ref type="bibr">Elias and Gygi (34)</ref>. After proteins were identified for selected spots using false discovery rate (FDR) and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-24">ProteinProphet</rs> (see details in the supplemental text, Part B), quantitation of -fold changes among different disease statuses was processed based on the following rules. 1) If a spot was quantitated by both <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-18">DeCyder</rs> <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-18" resp="#annotator18" type="version">6.5</rs> and <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-27">SameSpots</rs> methods, -fold changes by <rs cert="0.9" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-180">DeCyder</rs> <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-180" resp="#curator" type="version">6.5</rs> were selected because the differential expression resulting from this method is more significant on average. On the other hand, if only one quantitation method was used, results from that method were selected. 2) When multiple spots have the same protein identification, -fold changes were averaged for that protein. 3) When a spot resulted in several protein identifications, the same -fold changes were assigned to all proteins.</p>
            <p>Lab 2-Lab 2 performed label-free analysis. Peak lists were generated using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-21">MassLynx</rs> (<rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-21" resp="#annotator18" type="version">4.0</rs>) based on signals obtained by Q-ToF Micro spectrometer from Waters Micromass. The MS duty cycle was set at 1,1,4 as described in detail in the supplemental text, Part A. These data were converted to mzXML files using <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-22">MassWolf</rs> <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-22" resp="#annotator18" type="version">1.02</rs> with the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-34">Waters Datafile Access Component (DAC)</rs> library. Following the database search using the common criteria, quantitation was performed using a spectral count approach <ref type="bibr">(35)</ref>, which sums the number of total spectra assigned to the protein group in that sample. Only peptide spectra with <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-35">PeptideProphet</rs> probability greater than 0.75 or an error rate of 5% were counted for each IPI entry identified. Because individual level variation can be determined for this design, we used a straightforward procedure that tracks all proteins that are members of a single <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-36">ProteinProphet</rs> group within the experiment to associate groups across multiple experiments and to flag groups that are not directly comparable (supplemental text, Part B). After summing up to master protein groups across samples, the average spectral count of all IPI entries within a "master group" was assigned to that group. For each master group, total spectral counts from 10 HD-mid samples, 10 HD-early samples, and 10 control samples were summed up and used to calculate HD-mid/control, HD-early/control, and HD-mid/HD-early ratios. Intensity-dependent ratio plots (MAplots) and histograms of light/heavy ratios were examined to ensure the quality of data for the labeled experiments. M is the y-axis and A is the x-axis, where in this paper, M &#1005; Log 2 (Heavy) &#1002; Log 2 (Light); A &#1005; [ 1 &#8260;2] (Log 2 (Heavy) &#1001; Log 2 (Light)). Lab 3-Data from Lab 3 were acquired from the LTQ-FT instrument (Thermo Finnigan). Peak lists were generated by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-24">Xcalibur</rs> (version <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-24" resp="#annotator18" type="version">1.1</rs>) and converted to mzXML files using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-25">ReAdW</rs> <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-25" resp="#annotator18" type="version">1.1</rs> with <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-41">XRawfile</rs> library. Default parameters were used. Database search was carried out using the common parameters and the designated specific modifications (supplemental text, Part B). Protein groups with probability score &#1022;0.9 (corresponding to an overall error rate of 0.01) were considered confident proteins for downstream analysis. The Q3 algorithm <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref>, developed to accommodate a 3-dalton mass shift in heavy and light peptides, was used to compute the ratios between the light and heavy isotopic pairs using peak areas. More specifically, only confidently identified peptides (<rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-42">PeptideProphet</rs> probability &#1022;0.75 and mass error &#1021;20 ppm) were selected for further quantitation at the protein level. In three pairwise comparisons, the internal standard (IS) containing equal amounts of 30 samples was labeled with light acetyl group, and each of the three disease statuses (A, B, or C) was labeled with heavy acetyl group (for details, see supplemental text, Part A). Preliminary analysis found that light/heavy ratios were skewed for both IS versus HD-early and IS versus HD-mid experiments. Because the same amount of protein was loaded into the MS instrument and, in theory, most proteins in the disease and control should remain unchanged, we normalized these ratios. Normalization at the peptide level was performed by median centering the log ratios. Experiments were then aligned to infer the protein changes of different disease status comparisons. Protein inference was performed using the <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-43">ProteinProphet</rs> analysis tool at the lab level, and light/heavy ratios of these protein groups were inferred from ratios at the experiment level by comparing IPI numbers. HD-mid versus control, HD-early versus control, and HD-mid versus HD-early ratios for each protein group were calculated using IS/control, IS/HDmid, and IS/HD-early ratios from the three experiments.</p>
            <p>Lab 4 -LTQ OrbiTrap XL mass spectrometer from Thermo Finnigan was used, and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-28">Xcalibur</rs> (version <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-28" resp="#annotator18" type="version">2.2</rs>) was applied to generate peak lists. Data were converted to mzXML files using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-29">ReAdW</rs> <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-29" resp="#annotator18" type="version">1.1</rs> with <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-48">XRawfile</rs> library. Default parameters were used. Data were then searched with the common criteria plus specific modifications. Protein groups with probability score &#1022;0.9 (corresponding to an overall error rate of 0.01) were considered confident proteins for downstream analysis. For the labeled analysis, as with Lab 3, the Q3 algorithm <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref> was used to compute ratios between light and heavy isotopic pairs. And similarly to the methods used for Lab 3, peptides with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-49">PeptideProphet</rs> scores greater than 0.75 and a mass error of less than 20 ppm were selected for the protein level quantitation. Histograms of light/heavy ratios based on the number of cysteines in the peptides revealed that peptides with one cysteine have better normal distributions than peptides with more than one cysteine. Because 80% of peptides contain only one cysteine, only peptides with one cysteine were selected for protein level analysis. To ensure a high confidence of quantitation at the protein level, only those proteins with at least three quantitated peptides were used for further analysis. For the label-free analysis, accurate mass and time (AMT) methods were used to identify peptides in LC-MS data using a single AMT database containing all high quality (<rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-50">PeptideProphet</rs> probability &#1350;0.95) peptide identifications from all labeled (fractionated) and unlabeled (unfractionated) data from Lab 4. The LC-MS peptide features from each unlabeled sample were matched against the combined AMT database to provide peptide assignments. Each match was assigned a probability value based on mass error and normalized retention time error between the MS1 feature and the AMT peptide entry, and only matches with probability &#1350;0.95 or a false assignment rate &#1349;0.05 were kept. LC-MS peptide intensity values for the peptides were normalized across runs, and peptide ratios were calculated. The AMT database and matching were performed using the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-51">msInspect/AMT</rs> software platform <ref type="bibr">(36, 37)</ref>. Protein inference was performed using<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-52">ProteinProphet</rs>, and protein ratios were calculated as well. As with the Lab 3 analysis, experiments were aligned using the <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-53">ProteinProphet</rs> analysis tool at the lab level to infer the protein changes of different disease status comparisons for the labeled and unlabeled methods. Ratios of these protein groups were inferred from ratios at the experiment level by IPI numbers.</p>
            <p>Proteins, identified by their IPI sequence, were assigned to gene symbols by IPI protein cross-reference. Because the peptide level evidence cannot uniquely identify all IPI sequences, proteins were assembled by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-54">ProteinProphet</rs> into groups <ref type="bibr">(26)</ref>. Some of these protein groups contain unique protein sequences and gene symbols, and some contain multiple sequences that may result from the same gene symbol or from multiple genes within the same family (e.g. a protein group is assigned with HBG2, HBE1, HBG1, HBB, and HBD, all of which belong to the hemoglobin gene family) or multiple incompatible genes.</p>
            <p>Signal Processing of Tissue Transcriptional Expression Data-Because a significant fraction of plasma proteins is derived from various tissues and so are CSF proteins, which are filtered from plasma, to annotate proteins for their source tissues, it is critical that the transcriptional data set includes tissues of human major organs. The normal human tissue expression data set was acquired from published data provided by Ge et al. <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref> that includes a total of 36 types of normal human tissue, covering the complexity of human tissues. Because all CSF samples are from adult human, the annotation will focus on the adult tissue expression pattern. Therefore, data from three fetal tissues were removed. Ge et al. <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref> examined a "whole brain" and six subregions of the brain (amygdala, corpus callosum, caudate nucleus, cerebellum, hippocampus, and thalamus). However, the cortex region that is noted to have severe cell loss in Huntington disease patients was not included. We removed the "whole-brain" data because it is not obvious to us how this RNA sample was prepared. We added the cortex signals and substituted cerebellum and caudate nucleus data with data derived from an extensive study that was carried out on four parts of human normal brain (caudate nucleus, cerebellum, and BA4 and BA9 cortex) using the same microarray chips <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref>. After these brain data were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) DataSets, signals detected using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-35">Affymetrix microarray suite</rs> version <rs corresp="#ecfc7940c9-software-35" resp="#annotator18" type="version">5</rs> software (MAS5) for each probe were averaged over 21 caudate nucleus, 21 cerebellum, and 24 cortex (12 BA4 and 12 BA9) arrays. We plotted log 2 MAS5 signal of the caudate nucleus and cerebellum from Ge et al. <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref> versus those from Hodges et al. <ref type="bibr">(2)</ref> and found that the correlations are both 0.90 (supplemental <ref type="figure">Fig. S1)</ref>. These high correlations suggest that data from the two studies may be combined. So far, we have data for seven subregions of the brain. Because we want to annotate a gene as being active in the brain if it is active in any part of the brain, we summarized the brain expression data by taking the maximum across all seven subregions. As a result, transcriptional data of "brain tissues" and 26 other types of human tissues were included in our analysis. These tissues are from brain, heart, thymus, spleen, ovary, kidney, muscle, pancreas, prostate, intestine, colon, placenta, bladder, breast, uterus, thyroid, skin, salivary, trachea, adrenal, bone marrow, pituitary, spinal cord, testis, liver, stomach, and lung (supplemental <ref type="table">Table S5)</ref>. Finally many genes have multiple probes; one can choose to use the average signal or the maximum signal for each gene. In our analysis, the one with maximum signal among all tissues was selected because we considered that the maximum signal is the highest above the noise level. As a result, we observed 1941 tissue markers based on human array data (supplemental <ref type="table">Table S6</ref>). The definition of tissue-specific genes/proteins may vary with tissues included in the study and when the thresholds change.</p>
            <p>Analysis of Proteomics Data-Search engine performance and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-57">PeptideProphet</rs> details <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref> were inspected (supplemental <ref type="figure">Fig. S2A)</ref> to assure that sensitivity and error distributions were sufficient to determine correct and incorrect identifications from Labs 2, 3, and 4. The quality of data quantitation was determined by examining MA plots, histograms of light labeled/heavy labeled ratios at the peptide level, and histograms of the HD-early/control, HD-mid/control, and HD-mid/ HD-early ratios at the protein level (supplemental <ref type="figure">Fig. S2, B-D)</ref>. We observed that the distributions of logarithms of ratios are around 0 before normalization for all experiments except two interrogations from Lab 3. The log ratios for these two data sets were normalized to have a median of 0.</p>
            <p>Lab 1 used a DIGE method (see "Experimental Procedures") and quantitated a large number of fluorescent spots. Only those spots found to have significantly different changes based on fluorescence between the HD and control CSF were selected for tandem MS analysis. As a result, a total of 19 unique proteins for 42 spots were identified based on the MS/MS data <ref type="table">(Table II)</ref>, each of which is a putative biomarker candidate. As a verification of these protein identifications ("Experimental Procedures"), we compared them with the results provided by Lab 1 using the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-58">Mascot</rs> search engine (supplemental Table S9) and found that there is a high consistency between the two results. In addition, proteins from more spots have been identified in this study. Lab 2 is the only lab that performed individual (non-pooled) interrogation. 335 confident protein groups (with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-59">ProteinProphet</rs> probability &#1022;0.9) were found and of these, 319 were quantitated using spectral counting (35) of highly confident peptide spectra ("Experimental Procedures"). Lab 3 pooled samples by disease status and analyzed by d 0 /d 3 acetylation of the N terminus of the peptides. 263 confident protein groups were found after aligning the three experiments using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="ecfc7940c9-software-simple-60">ProteinProphet</rs>. After protein ratios were inferred from individual experiments, 161 were confidently quantitated. Lab 4 pooled samples by disease status and gender. In three pairwise comparisons, proteins in pooled CSF of two disease statuses were differentially labeled with light and heavy acrylamide on cysteine residues. Because a more extensive prefractionation strategy was used, these data resulted in identification of the majority of proteins (1179 groups) reported in this study of which 377 were confidently quantitated by the Q3 algorithm (27) ("Experimental Procedures"). In addition, Lab 4's label-free analysis using AMT methods <ref type="bibr">(37)</ref> identified and quantitated 277 protein groups <ref type="table">(Table II)</ref>, &#1011;100 of which are not quantitated by the labeled approach <ref type="table">(Table III)</ref>.</p>

            <p>Several reports have demonstrated that the VITEK 2 GN card misidentifies P dagmatis as P pneumotropica or P canis, despite an excellent identification probability <ref type="bibr">(9,15,23,24)</ref>. This is most likely because P dagmatis has not been included in the system database; as well, there has been a nomenclature change because P dagmatis was formerly grouped with P pneumotropica, type Henriksen. In a study that included 66 clinical Pasturella isolates and used sodA gene sequencing as a reference method, Zangenah et al <ref type="bibr">(24)</ref> revealed that VITEK 2 only identified approximately 50% of Pasturella isolates correctly, while conventional biochemical tests and MALDI-ToF MS were able to correctly identify 94% and 89%, respectively. Interestingly, in the Zangenah et al <ref type="bibr">(24)</ref> study, two P dagmatis isolates were not identified by VITEK MS MALDI-ToF (BioMerieux, France) and this limitation was also observed in our study (data not shown). The biological and genetic profiles among P dagmatis, P pneumotropica and P stomatis are very similar <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref>; both a commercial biochemical identification system and the sequence analysis of a portion of the 16S rRNA gene were unable to differentiate between these species.</p>
            <p>Correct identification was made using MALDI-ToF MS (MALDI Biotyper, Bruker, Germany) and was also supported by comparing the key biochemical characteristics among P dagmatis, P pneumotropica and P stomatis <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). It is probable that many clinical isolates of P dagmatis have been misidentified due to the limitation of commercial biochemical identification systems, such as VITEK 2. Misidentification may have contributed to an underestimation of the frequency of this organism in clinical samples; however, the growing use of MALDI-ToF MS systems for microorganism identification in routine clinical microbiology laboratories may allow for a more accurate picture of how frequently P dagmatis causes infections. Correct identification is important for diagnosis and therapeutic management, and epidemiological monitoring of the transmission of Pasturella species, particularly for the systemic infections such as in the present case. Unfortunately, most routine methods available at hospital laboratories cannot identify the organism correctly.</p>
            <p>P dagmatis can cause severe animal-associated infections in humans, mainly in immunocompromised individuals. To our knowledge, this is the first systemic P dagmatis infection reported in Canada. Clinical outcomes rely on early accurate laboratory confirmation and timely administration of effective antibiotic treatment. Conventional identification of P dagmatis using VITEK 2 can be misleading, probably due to the absence of this organism from the database; 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and MALDI-ToF MS systems represent excellent options for identifying rarely encountered or difficult to identify organisms, such as members of the Pasturellaceae family. The present study re-emphasizes the need for continuously improving the database of automatic microbial identification systems.</p>

            <p>VC was performed using a CO 2 SMOS Plus 8100 Dixtal/ Novametrix &#174; (Respironics, Murrisville, PA, USA). The subjects remained breathing tidal volume for 4 minutes. During this time, the variables were measured and data was stored in a computer with the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="c1c6cfec19-software-simple-0">Analysis Plus</rs> &#174; software. At the end of data collection, an offline sequence of the respiratory cycles of the subjects was selected to accommodate a variation of ,15% for expiratory tidal volume and of ,5% for ETCO 2 tension. Respiratory cycles that had Slp2 and Slp3 equal to zero were excluded. The main variables analyzed were ETCO 2 , Slp2, Slp3, inspiratory time (T i ), expiratory time (T e ), and expiratory volume (V e ). Both slopes are given by the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="c1c6cfec19-software-simple-1">Analysis Plus</rs> &#174; software.

            <p>Mouse hearts were quickly dissected and washed in cold PBS. After removal of the atria, ventricles were lysed in a Precellys ceramic lysing kit tube with 1 ml RIPA buffer by two 30-s cycles at 5,000 rpm in PRECELLYS 24 (Bertin Technologies). Ventricle or adult cardiomyocyte lysates (see the Adult mouse cardiomyocyte isolation section) were then incubated with wheat germ agglutinin-agarose beads in RIPA buffer for 4 h at 4&#176;C. Beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min before loading in 4-12% NuPAGE (Life Technologies) precast gels for Western analysis. For the analysis of CamKII, PLB, and Troponin I, hearts were perfused in a Langendorff apparatus as described in the Langendorff heart preparation section with a modified Krebs solution with or without 20 ng/ml BDNF (PeproTech) or 5 &#181;M Forskolin (Sigma-Aldrich) used as a positive control. Heart contractility was monitored during the perfusion process and at the peak of cardiac pressure induced by BDNF or Forskolin the hearts were snap frozen with stainless steel clamps cooled in liquid nitrogen and stored frozen before homogenization in RIPA buffer supplemented with proteases (complete mini; Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (PhosSTOP; Roche). Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 15 min at 4&#176;C and the supernatants were diluted in 2&#215; Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, and loaded in a gel for Western analysis. Membranes (PVDF; Life Technologies) were blocked in 5% nonfat milk or 5% BSA in TBS-Tween before incubation with a specific antibody. Antibodies were as follows: anti-TrkB (against the extracellular domain of TrkB and therefore recognizing all TrkB isoforms; EMD Millipore), anti-TrkB.T1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-GAPDH (EMD Millipore), anti-CaV 1.2a1c (L-Type calcium channel subunit a1c,; Alomone Lab), anti-HA (for Western, Covance; for immunoprecipitation, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-Phospho-TrkB raised against phosphorylated TrkB-Tyr516 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-total CAMKII (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-CAMKII P-T286/T287 (Cell Signaling Technology), antitotal Phospholamban (Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-Phospholamban P-S16 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Phospholamban P-T17 (Badrilla), and anti-total and P-Ser 23/24 Troponin I (Cell Signaling Technology). After incubation with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, membranes were incubated with ECL substrate for detection of HRP enzyme activity (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and visualized in a Syngene gel documentation system. Images were splined <ref type="bibr">(Arganda-Carreras et al., 2006)</ref> as needed and quantified by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="b0ac6e5094-software-0">ImageJ</rs> analysis (<rs corresp="#b0ac6e5094-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">National Institutes of Health</rs>). Student's t test was used for statistical significance assessment.</p>
            <p>Male mice (2 mo, 19-25 g) were injected with heparin (5,000 U/kg i.p.) and after 10 min were anesthetized with Avertin (150 mg/kg i.p.). Hearts were quickly removed from the chest and put into 16-18&#176;C calcium-free modified Krebs solution containing 118 mmol NaCl, 23 mmol NaHCO 3 , 3.2 mmol KCl, 1.2 mmol KH 2 PO 4 , 1.2 mmol MgSO 4 , 11 mmol glucose, and 2 mmol sodium pyruvate before being mounted in a Langendorff perfusion system <ref type="bibr">(Broadley, 1979)</ref>. Hearts were perfused with modified Krebs solution containing 1.5 mM CaCl 2 (37.5&#176;C) via the aorta. All solutions were bubbled with 95% O 2 -5% CO 2 , pH 7.40, and kept at 37&#176;C. An inflatable water-filled balloon was inserted into the left ventricle via a small incision in the left atrium for measurement of the left ventricle pressure (BIOPAC Systems Inc.). Perfusion pressure and coronary flow were also continuously monitored via a differential pressure transducer. All channels were fed to a digidata 1322a (Axon) for digitalization storage and analysis using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="b0ac6e5094-software-1">Igor</rs> <rs corresp="#b0ac6e5094-software-1" resp="#annotator7" type="version">4.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#b0ac6e5094-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Wave- Metrics</rs>) or <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="b0ac6e5094-software-2">Clampfit</rs> (<rs corresp="#b0ac6e5094-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Axon</rs>) software.</p>
            <p>Calcium tolerant adult cardiomyocytes were loaded with Indo1-AM for 1 h, washed with control solution, and left at room temperature for at least 45 min to allow deesterification of the dye. Loading solution was prepared from a control solution containing 0.2 mM Ca 2+ and 1 mM Indo1-AM (1 mM stock in dimethyl sulfoxide; Life Technologies) dissolved first in Pluronic surfactant (PowerLoad 100&#215;; Life Technology) with 1 mg/ml BSA. Cardiomyocytes were field stimulated (0.5/s) with platinum electrodes (FHC Inc.) and recordings were made at 27&#176;C in 1 mM Ca 2+ solution. BDNF was applied at 50 ng/ml using a picospritzer at 30 hPa and a glass pipette with 1-M Ohm tip resistance. Excited at 340 nM, indo1-AM emission was split into two channels and passed through 405/10-nm (calcium-bound emission) and 488/10-nm (calcium-free emission) fluorescence filters. Light collected by photodiodes (Till Photonics) was digitally converted at 10 KHz (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="b0ac6e5094-software-3">pClamp</rs> <rs corresp="#b0ac6e5094-software-3" resp="#curator" type="version">10</rs> and Digidata 1322a) and computed and the information was stored.</p>
            <p>Ca 2+ -tolerant cardiomyocytes cells were placed in a recording chamber and perfused with a Na + -free solution containing 137 mM tetraethylammonium chloride, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM Hepes, and 10 mM glucose (pH 7.4 with TEA-OH) at a flux of 1 ml/min at 27&#176;C. The pipette solution contained 111 mM CsCl, 20 mM tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mM glucose, 14 mM EGTA, 10 mM Hepes, and 5 mM MgATP (pH 7.3 with CsOH). Pulled borosilicate glass pipettes at &#8764;3-4 MOhm filled with pipette solution were used to obtain gigaseal on cardiomyocytes and subsequent whole-cell voltage clamp. Currents (I Ca&#8722;L ) were elicited by applying depolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of &#8722;60 mV (-50 mV to +70 mV, 10-mV increments) and recorded (filtered at 2 kHz through a 4-pole low-pass Bessel filter and digitized at 5 kHz) with a Multiclamp 700B (Axon) using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="b0ac6e5094-software-5">pClamp</rs> software (<rs corresp="#b0ac6e5094-software-5" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Axon</rs>).

            <p>A total of 2095 RNA structure entries were reported by the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="db3ab4eff6-software-simple-0">PDB</rs> search engine in July, 2011. We have developed a software in<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="db3ab4eff6-software-simple-1">GNU-Octave</rs>, which is similar to <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="db3ab4eff6-software-simple-2">MATLAB</rs> scripting language, that i) Programmatically examines and reads the information of all the RNA structures from the PDB files and classifies them, ii) Creates the necessary database files, and iii) Creates the web-layout of HTML pages displayed in the server containing major information of each RNA chain.</p>
            <p>As the classification shows, there are many RNA classes where the numbers of PDB files are 10 or greater. These subclasses have been shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> and corresponding MOL_ID's are shown as a suffix to the PDB-ID. They carry signatures that may indicate variations introduced in the molecular structure due to ligand binding or alteration of crystallization conditions. Eventually, they can be referred to as crystallographic ensembles in analogy with statistical ensembles obtained from molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations as done recently <ref type="bibr">(Halder and Bhattacharyya, 2010; Samanta et al., 2010)</ref>. We have performed pair-wise secondary structure comparison for these classes to compare the structural similarity between them. For secondary structure assignment, the base pairing patterns of each RNA structure in a functional class have been obtained using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="db3ab4eff6-software-simple-3">BPFind</rs> software tool <ref type="bibr">(Das et al., 2006)</ref>. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="db3ab4eff6-software-simple-4">BPFind</rs> gives us the secondary structure of a nucleic acid at the basepairing level. These secondary structural information of basepairing for each chain have been converted to a one-dimensional string of characters: H, N, T, and L corresponding to Watson-Crick base pairs, non-canonical base pairs, base triplets, and unpaired www.frontiersin.orgbases, respectively. The secondary structures thus obtained correspond to individual RNA chains separately and do not consider inter-chain base pairing information. These secondary structural sequences are then compared with that of the best representative structure of that class using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm <ref type="bibr">(Needleman and Wunsch, 1970)</ref> as implemented in <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="db3ab4eff6-software-simple-5">EMBOSS</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Rice et al., 2000)</ref>. An identity scoring matrix (EDNAMAT) was used for such alignment with a gap-open penalty of &#8722;10.0 and gap-extension penalty of -0.5. We find that the average similarity is 80% or more for a set of similar structures of a given class having 30 or more RNA chains. The detailed analyses of structural variation among these crystallographic ensembles are beyond the scope of this paper and would be presented elsewhere. Here a point to note is that secondary structure comparison have not been performed for crystal structures with resolution worse than 3.5&#197; because of the poor quality of secondary structural information obtained from such structures. RNA structures solved by NMR spectroscopy or electron microscopy are also not included in secondary structure comparison for the same reason.Comparison of secondary structure can also be useful to predict the functions of unannotated RNAs. As mentioned in the earlier section, the functional types of many RNA chains that have been placed under the other-RNA and unannotated-RNA classes could not be obtained from the PDB files unambiguously.</p>
            <p>However, we find that there are a number of structures in these two types, which are of significant length (30 nucleotide or more). We have performed structural comparison of these RNA chains with known functional RNAs available in the suggested nonredundant dataset, consisting of only X-ray crystal structures with www.frontiersin.org resolution better than 3.5&#197;. For the secondary structure alignment, the basepairing pattern for each RNA structure in the non-redundant dataset, obtained using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="db3ab4eff6-software-simple-6">BPFind</rs> software, comprises a database of known structural forms of well-classified functional RNAs. In a similar way, the secondary structural data for each of the unannotated RNA chains were generated and compared against the database of known structural forms. Thus, the secondary structural information of an unannotated RNA chain has been aligned with secondary structural information of each RNA chain present in the non-redundant dataset using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global sequence alignment. We have assigned probable function of an unannotated RNA as identical to some known structural form with which the best similarity score is obtained. For example, chain A of 1FIR shows highest score of 362 against chain A of 1EVV <ref type="table">Table 4)</ref>.</p>

            <p>Given the dramatic pace of expansion in experimental and bioinformatics data pertaining to TA systems in the last 10 years and the likely impending avalanche triggered by next-generation sequencing-facilitated prokaryoticand metagenomic-sequencing projects, we have created a<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-0">PostgreSQL</rs> database of Type 2 TA systems, known as TADB (http://bioinfo-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/TADB/), that provides for ready access, analysis, manipulation and exploitation of this invaluable biological information. We propose that TADB should serve as a 'one-stop-shop' for all Type 2 TA data sets and resources and are confident that in time it will facilitate efficient, multi-disciplinary and innovative exploration of the bacteria and archaea TA space, further defining presently recognized phenomena and potentially even leading to yet-to-be envisaged frontiers.</p>
            <p>As of 30 July 2010, TADB contains 10 753 type 2 TA gene pairs identified within 1240 genome sequences representative of 962 strains of phylogenetically diverse bacteria and archaea. The data in TADB are derived from computationally predicted data sets and/or reports of experimentally validated TA genes. The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-1">BLASTP</rs>-identified 921 TA loci present in 147 sequenced genomes reported by Gerdes and co-workers <ref type="bibr">(3,7)</ref> were first uploaded and classified into eight TA families. Next, the 5806 TA loci found in 604 genomes which had been assigned to 44 conserved TA domain pairs by <ref type="bibr">Makarova et al. (4)</ref> were archived in TADB. The database was then further complemented with the data set of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-2">RASTA-Bacteria</rs> predicted TA loci identified in 883 annotated genomes. The <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-3">RASTA- Bacteria</rs> algorithm utilizes <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-4">RPSBLAST</rs> search and typical characteristics of TA loci, such as a two-gene, co-directed module coding for small proteins, to identify TA hits <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref>. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-5">RASTA-Bacteria</rs> TA pair hits with one score &gt;70% and the other &gt;60% were recorded by TADB, this strict cut-off yields broadly reliable TA candidates <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref>. Subsequently, the three data sets mentioned above were compared to ensure that only de-duplicated entries were included in TADB; identical TA loci from identical strains were eliminated.</p>
            <p>In addition, we have identified further examples of known or putative TA loci by searching PubMed using the search terms 'toxin AND antitoxin' and manually inspecting all PubMed hits. Supplementary TA loci identified by this literature search strategy included six TA pairs, absent from the first three data sets mentioned above, in M. tuberculosis H37Rv (NC_000962) that had recently been <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref>. At present, TADB contains details of 106 experimentally validated TA loci. Significantly, text mining has identified a further three TA families and three three-component TA families that belong to more recently identified TA families that would not be detected by the current version of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-6">RASTA-Bacteria</rs>. Our TADB database now includes members of 11 two-component and 3 three-component TA families. These TA families were classified based on toxin protein sequence similarity and tertiary structure, as described in the reviews by Gerdes et al. <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> and Van Melderen and Saavedra De Bast (2) (See http://bioinfo-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/TADB/ Introduction.html for more details). We have also classified TADB entries by a second classification system based on identification of TA pairs sharing cognate TA domains and independent of wider protein-level similarity as suggested recently by <ref type="bibr">Makarova et al. (4)</ref>, yet again offering the potential for future enhanced genome data mining and further expansion of the TADB database. TADB is expected to grow dramatically given next-generation sequencing-facilitated rapid acceleration in prokaryotefocused whole genome sequencing projects. As more information about the TA loci becomes available, the database will be expanded and improved accordingly.</p>
            <p>TADB is implemented as a <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-7">PostgreSQL</rs> relational database. The ontology-based Chado schema (15) was employed to house annotations and sequences of 1000 prokaryotic genomes which had been downloaded from the NCBI Refseq archive <ref type="bibr">(16)</ref>. A second customized schema was designed to organize the available experimental and in silico analyses data and references relating to TA loci reported in the literatures. TADB runs on a <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-8">Linux</rs> platform with the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-9">Apache</rs> web-server. Web interfaces were developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The majority of data pipelines were developed with PHP and Perl. In addition, the following freely available components were employed: (i) genome browser <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-10">Gbrowse</rs> <ref type="formula">(17)</ref>; (ii) circular genome visualization tool <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-11">CGview</rs> (18); (iii) multiple sequence alignment and visualization tools,<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-12">MUSCLE</rs> <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-13">Jalview</rs> <ref type="formula">(20)</ref>; (iv) primer design tool <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-14">Primer3Plus</rs> (21); (v) <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-15">IslandViewer</rs> (database of genomic islands) <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>; (vi) dndDB (database of DNA backbone phosphorothioation) (23); (vii) ACLAME database (A CLAssification of genetic Mobile Elements) (24); (viii) GOLD database of genome sequencing projects <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref>.</p>
            <p>At the heart of TADB is the 'Browse by organism' page that provides a hyperlinked organized catalog of over 900 prokaryotic genomes with TA systems identified by one of the above-mentioned strategies. TADB allows the users to view genomic maps flagged by hyperlinked TA loci color-coded by TA family to provide a genome-scale view TA locus repertoires. In addition, users can access individual pages dedicated to each TA locus pair, toxin and antitoxin as required. As an example, TA loci in Geobacter uraniireducens Rf4 (NCBI Refseq accession no. NC_009483) were analysed <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Geobacter uraniireducens Rf4 is a Gram negative Delta Proteobacteria which can reduce uranium using acetate and other organic acids (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S3C)</ref>. Recently G. uraniireducens has been used experimentally in bioremediation of metal-contaminated subsurface environments <ref type="bibr">(26)</ref>. Tabulated <ref type="figure">(Figure 1A)</ref> and graphically displayed <ref type="figure">(Figure 1B)</ref> outputs of the 74 putative TA pairs with conserved TA domains (4) in G. uraniireducens Rf4 are as shown. In addition, a further eight putative TA loci predicted by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-16">RASTA-Bacteria</rs> (6) are also included in these outputs. The genomic context of a selected TA locus is readily investigated further by using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-17">Gbrowse</rs>, as shown for the putative TA locus Gura_2469-Gura_2470 <ref type="figure">(Figure 1D)</ref>. The putative toxin protein (yet to be experimentally characterized), Gura_2470, contains a MNT (minimal nucleotidyltransferase) domain, while its cognate putative antitoxin, Gura_2469, harbors a HEPN (higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide-binding) domain (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S3D) (4)</ref>. Equivalent domain-level data are available for 12 other G. uraniireducens Rf4 putative TA pairs archived within TADB (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S3)</ref>. Interestingly, a second putative TA pair Gura_2467-Gura_2468 (4) is located a short distance upstream of the Gura_2469-Gura_2470 TA pair. This second toxin, Gura_2467, contains a RES domain (COG5654), which contains three highly conserved polar groups (arginine, glutamate and serine) that could form an active site. Its matching antitoxin, Gura_2468, contains an Xre family HTH (helix-turn-helix) domain (COG5642). Remarkably, the two tandem putative TA loci are located within a single 18-kb dnd island, details of which are archived within dndDB <ref type="figure">(Figure 1D)</ref> <ref type="bibr">(23)</ref>. Based on available data, the G. uraniireducens Rf4 dnd gene cluster (Gura_2472-2476) is likely to code for enzymes required for sequence-specific phosphorothioation of the DNA backbone <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref>. Consistent with a foreign origin, this 18-kb dnd island exhibits a lower G+C content (51%) than the genome average (54%) and codes for two likely transposase proteins (Gura_2461 and Gura_2462). Gura_2466, one of the island borne genes that lies close to the two TA loci, codes for an unusual 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase. This protein possesses one of the smallest enzyme subunits known <ref type="bibr">(28)</ref>. Bacteria belonging to the Geobacter genus are often the predominant species in a wide diversity of subsurface sediments under metalreducing conditions <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref>. Given the abundance of phylogenetically diverse and functionally distinct TA loci within G. uraniireducens Rf4, it would be tempting to speculate that cumulative acquisition of TA loci and/or associated physically-linked mobile genetic DNA directly contributed to the environmental success and hardiness of Geobacter.</p>

Direct links to matching PubMed entries are also offered. At present this resource contains records of over 240 directly relevant scientific publications. This reference collection will be updated on a monthly basis with new entries being subject to subsequent manual curation and organization in a timely manner. The TADB reference collection has been sorted by the following headings: experimental studies, in silico analysis, protein structure data (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S2C)</ref>. TADB links the reviewed literatures to relevant TA loci, TA family, toxin domain, antitoxin domain and species pages as indicated by the corresponding thumbnail icons. The TADB reference collection is also searchable by TA family, author, title, journal, year, PubMed ID and matching abstracts can be subjected to standard word searches. This provides an easily accessible literature resource that has been subjected to both text mining and manual curation.</p>
            <p>As future developments, we will shortly be updating the records of experimentally verified TA loci with more functional information such as details of toxin targets, mechanisms of action of antitoxins, promoter, Shine-Dalgarno, terminator and identified TA loci regulators. Comparative analysis tool will also be incorporated into TADB to facilitate large scale synteny mapping of chromosomally encoded TA loci and their associated genomic islands. We are also exploring a pipeline, including the use of<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="d7a744ef47-software-simple-24">RPSBLAST</rs>, to implement automated searches of annotated or unannotated genome sequences for presently undiscovered potential members of the TADB-recorded families.</p>

Similarly, after the independence of India, Prime Minister Nehru often evoked the commanding-heights metaphor. Typically, these countries, as well as Germany, Korea, Japan, many Latin American countries, and of course, all socialist countries, had strong state control/ownership over strategic sectors such as defense, iron and steel, railroads, ship-building, utilities, and telecom. In these sectors, the key consideration for decentralization is likely not to utilize local information but to ensure the benefits of "strategic control."

A group of experienced, Spanish speaking researchers from INSP and Tulane University read the interview and focus group transcripts to code the data and group them into key concepts and analytical axes. Some of the codes were generated according to the research questions, while others emerged from the interviews. <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="cf9feb73e7-software-6">NVivo</rs> <rs corresp="#cf9feb73e7-software-6" resp="#annotator22" type="version">9.2</rs> software 22 was used to analyze the data around three analytical axes: design and development of the EHR ( planning and organization, criteria, and requirements), implementation of the EHR (users, constraints, and resources), and the impact of the EHR (benefits, recommendations, and vision for the future) (table 4). Each researcher coded separate interviews. Before starting, a coding exercise was conducted to make sure all researchers were interpreting the codes in the same way and there was constant discussion during the analysis to ensure there was agreement across researchers.</p>

            <p>Molecular Modeling and Ligand Docking-Homology modeling of hFFA2 and hFFA3 receptors using the &#9252; 2 -adrenergic receptor (Protein Data Bank code 2RH1) as a template was conducted using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="f605b5d960-software-3">MOE</rs> software (Molecular Operating Environment, <rs corresp="#f605b5d960-software-3" resp="#annotator17" type="version">2009</rs>, <rs corresp="#f605b5d960-software-3" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Chemical Computing Group, Inc</rs>., Montreal, Quebec, Canada) with a default homology modeling protocol. Selection of homology models was based on the location of extracellular loop 2 (ECL2). Only models where ECL2 was located relatively similarly to the available crystal structures of the ligand-bound GPCRs were considered for docking. Thus, ECL2 conformations that prevented entrance to the putative binding cavity were excluded for the next steps. The available model of FFA1 <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref>, with the side-chain conformers optimized according to mutagenesis data for HisVI:16/4.56, ArgV:05/ 5.39, HisVI:20/6.55, and ArgVII:02/7.35, was used to optimize the rough homology models of hFFA2 and hFFA3 obtained. Docking of SCAs into these models and those containing proposed mutants was performed using the Glide module of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="f605b5d960-software-simple-3">Schr&#246;dinger</rs> software <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>.

The Glide default settings with the extraprecision scoring option were used for docking. Images were prepared using the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f605b5d960-software-simple-4">Maestro 8.5 interface</rs> (23).</p>

            <p>Transmission electron microscopy. Four-month-old mice pretreated with HFD for 8 weeks were used. Muscles were isolated, fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M Sorenson's buffer (PH 7.2), and treated with 1% OsO4 also in Sorenson's buffer for 1 h. After dehydration and embedment in Lx-112 (Ladd Research Industries), thin sections (60 nm) were cut using a MT-7000 ultramicrotome, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined under a JEOL JEM-1200 EXII electron microscope. Pictures were captured by an ORCA-HR digital camera (Hamamatsu) and recorded with an AMT Image Capture Engine. Indirect calorimetry. Twenty-week-old weight-matched male MCK-DGAT1 mice and wild-type littermates that had been on a HFD for 8 weeks were singly housed in metabolic chambers. After 2-4 days of adaptation, oxygen consumption, locomotor activity, and respiration exchange ratio were measured continuously over at least 5 days during 12:12 light-dark cycles, using a CLAMS (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) open-circuit indirect calorimetry system as previously described <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref>.

            <p>20. The p value associated with the hypothesis that the empirical distribution function of &#916; 1 w in the formal sector is "smaller" is 0.000, whereas the p value associated with the hypothesis that the empirical distribution function of &#916; 1 w in the informal sector is "smaller" is 0.000, indicating no ranking between these two distributions in terms of first order stochastic dominance.However, the distribution of wage growth in the informal sector appears to be slightly more disperse than in the formal sector, suggesting that wages are more flexible in the informal sector, both for wage increases and wage decreases. A traditional variance ratio test rejects the hypothesis that the variance of &#916; 1 w in the formal sector is equal to the variance of &#916; 1 w in the informal sector in favor of an alternative that the variance of &#916; 1 w in the formal sector is smaller. 21 However, this test is sensitive to the assumption that the data are drawn from a Normal distribution. Using a test for the equality of variances that is robust when dealing with skewed distributions <ref type="bibr">(Brown and Forsythe 1974; Levene 1960</ref>) also rejects the null hypothesis that the variances are equal. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> Next, I explore how wage growth in the informal sector compares to wage growth in the formal 21. For the variance ratio test, I used the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="b3b45b86ad-software-simple-0">Stata</rs> command sdtest. The null hypothesis of this test is that the ratio r = &#963; 2 FS &#8725;&#963; 2 IS equals 1, i.e. H 0 : r = 1. The calculated test statistic is f = 0.6605, which is distributed as F <ref type="bibr">(32172,27221)</ref>, where the degrees of freedom in the numerator and denominator are (n FS &#8722; 1) and (n IS &#8722; 1), respectively. This null is rejected against the alternative H 1 : r &lt; 1 with a p value of 0.0000, and against the alternative H 1 : r &#8800; 1 with a p value of 0.0000, but cannot be rejected against the alternative H 1 : r &gt; 1 with a p value of 1.0000.</p>
            <p>22. To test the hypothesis of equal variances, I used the<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="b3b45b86ad-software-simple-1">Stata</rs> command robvar which provides three alternative test statistics that vary the measure of central tendency used to calculate the test. The first one uses the mean of each group under comparison, the second uses the median of each group, and the third uses the 10% trimmed mean of each group. The first variant of the test is the one proposed by <ref type="bibr">Levene (1960)</ref>, the other two are the ones proposed by <ref type="bibr">Brown and</ref> sector conditional on individual and firm characteristics and for different time spans. To this end, I estimate the following wage-growth regressions:</p>

Genetic diversity in terms of heterozygosity varied from low to high across loci in both populations. Observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.13 to 0.78 (mean H o = 0.59) and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.37 to 0.77 (mean H e = 0.57) at El Comit&#225;n. At Punta Prieta, observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.03 to 0.85 (mean H o = 0.41) and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.03 to 0.72 (mean H e = 0.40) ( <ref type="table">Table 2 )</ref>. For this study, we assumed tetraploidy in both populations because we observed as many as four alleles per locus in individual plants. Our results are also consistent with a tetrasomic pattern of inheritance previously suggested in P. pringlei , based on an allozymatic study <ref type="bibr">( Murawski et al., 1994</ref>) and a chromosome counting study <ref type="bibr">( Pinkava et al., 1973 )</ref>.</p>

            <p>The primary outcome for this study was the rate of emergency cesarean section, which we compared across the prepregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain categories. The secondary outcome was the risk of emergency cesarean section among the prepregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain categories. For an inter-group comparison of age, prepregnancy weight and BMI, gestational weight gain, gestational age at delivery and neonate birth weight, we used an independent t-test. For a comparison of parity, GDM, the incidence of LGA infants, each BMI status and each gestational weight gain status based on the 2009 IOM guidelines, a chi-square test was used. To evaluate the crude association between prepregnancy BMI or gestational weight gain and emergency cesarean section, logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We also calculated the adjusted ORs after adjusting for potential confounding factors, including maternal age, parity, gestational age at delivery, birth weight, labor induction, LGA, fetal sex, and GDM. Additional regression models included prepregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain with the other confounders to evaluate the independent effect of prepregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain on the risk of emergency cesarean section. To further investigate the difference gestational weight gain-emergency cesarean section association stratified by maternal prepregnancy BMI, we calculated the adjusted ORs after adjusting for confounders with gestational weight gain in each prepregnancy BMI group.

            <p>Profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been one of the most successful methods to date for recognizing both close and distant homologs of given protein sequences. Popular HMM methods such as <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-0">HMMER</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Eddy et al., 1998a, b)</ref> and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-1">SAM</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Hughey and Krogh, 1996)</ref> have been behind the design of databases such as Pfam <ref type="bibr">(Finn et al., 2006)</ref>, PROSITE <ref type="bibr">(Hulo et al., 2006)</ref> and SUPERFAMIILY <ref type="bibr">(Wilson et al., 2007)</ref>. However, a limitation of these HMMs is, since there is only finite state information about the sequence that can be held in any particular position, HMMs cannot capture dependencies that are far, and variable distance apart, in sequence.</p>
            <p>While these conditional random field and Markov random field models are extremely powerful in theory, in practice, substantial computational barriers remain for template construction, training and computing the minimum energy threading of an unknown sequence onto a template. Thus, a general structure software tool designed for &#946;-structural folds, in the same manner as <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-2">HMMER</rs> and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-3">SAM</rs> packages recognize all protein structural folds, remains a challenging unsolved problem.</p>
            <p>In this article, we compare ordinary <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-4">HMMER</rs> Profile HMMs,<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-5">HMMER</rs> Profile HMMs augmented with a point mutation model (similar to <ref type="bibr">Kumar and Cowen, 2009)</ref>, and HMMs augmented with training sequences based on pairwise dependencies of &#946;-sheet hydrogen bonding (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). Thus we have generalized the single frequency approach of <ref type="bibr">Kumar and Cowen (2009)</ref>based on &#946;-strand constrained evolution, the following pipeline is followed:</p>
            <p>For the single frequency augmented training model, we used the popular program <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-8">MUSCLE</rs> Version<rs corresp="#ca543acf2c-software-8" resp="#annotator2" type="version">4</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Edgar, 2004)</ref> to generate the MSA that was provided to the HMM training methods. It is one of the fastest programs available and produces global sequence alignments for the set of sequences from a family. We developed a script to transform the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-8">MUSCLE</rs> alignment output to .ssi (STOCKHOLM) format since other <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-9">MUSCLE</rs> output formats are not supported by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-11">HMMER</rs> <rs corresp="#ca543acf2c-software-11" resp="#annotator2" type="version">3.0a2</rs>.</p>
            <p>&#946;&#8722;Strands in the aligned set of structures are found by the program <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-13">SmurfPreparse</rs> which is part of the Smurf Package <ref type="bibr">(Menke, 2009; Menke et al., 2010)</ref>. The program not only outputs the positions of the consensus &#946;-strands in the alignment, it also declares a position buried or exposed based on which of the two tables is the best fit to the amino acids that appear in that position in the training data.</p>
            <p>Two packages are widely adopted to work width profile HMMs: <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-13">SAM</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Hughey and Krogh, 1996)</ref> and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-16">HMMER</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Eddy, 1998a, b)</ref>. <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-15">SAM</rs> has been demonstrated to be more sensitive overall, while <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-16">HMMER</rs>'s model scoring is more accurate <ref type="bibr">(Wistrand and Sonnhammer, 2004)</ref>. In this study we use<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-18">HMMER</rs> versions <rs corresp="#ca543acf2c-software-18" resp="#annotator2" type="version">3.0a2</rs> to evaluate the models of protein families as it is freely available and can be easily downloaded from the website. We construct HMMs from the MSAs using the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-19">hmmbuild</rs> program which is part of the<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-20">HMMER</rs> package.</p>
            <p>In this approach, the model of the HMM is made up of a linear set of match (M) states, one per consensus column in the MSA. Each M state emits a single residue, with a probability score that is determined by the frequency that residues have been observed in the corresponding column of the MSA. Each match state therefore carries a vector of 20 probabilities, for scoring the 20 amino acids. The HMMs also model the gapped alignments by including insertion (I) and deletion (D) states in between the match states. The match, insertion and deletion states are connected by the transition probabilities. In our experiment, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-21">HMMER</rs> is used as a black box except the constraints on choosing match states are made tighter. Using default settings, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-22">HMMER</rs> creates a match state whenever a column in the MSA has &lt;50% gaps. We found empirically in <ref type="bibr">Kumar and Cowen (2009)</ref> that the default cutoff was not optimal for our datasets because homology was too remote, and creating a column whenever there are &lt;20% gaps yielded the best HMMs on our datasets. Thus we duplicate this threshold in the current study.</p>
            <p>By default, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-23">HMMER</rs> uses a maximum a posteriori (MAP) architecture algorithm to find the model architecture with the highest posterior probability for the alignment data. The algorithm is guaranteed to find a model and i289 constructs the model by assuming that the MSA is correct and then marks columns that correspond to match states. An HMM is created for every MSA, thus there is a one to one correspondence between an MSA and an HMM, generating a library of HMMs. Therefore, for any sequence from the MSA, the HMM can be used to determine if it belongs to the MSA. In addition, the HMM can be used to check if a new sequence is similar to the sequences in the MSA and if it is then one can place the new protein in the same family. We used the default 'glocal' setting to construct the models which are global with respect to model and find multiple hit local with respect to sequence.</p>
            <p>In order to reduce the skewness in the distribution of sequences used to construct an HMM, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-24">HMMER</rs> supports several options to weight the sequences in training data. The default option GSC assigns lower weights to sequences that are over-represented <ref type="bibr">(Gerstein et al., 1994)</ref>. In addition,<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-25">HMMER</rs> supports external and internal sequence weighting strategies based on information theoretic principles. Based on our study of different sequence weighting options for HMMs with and without the point mutation augmented training for the task of learning SCOP superfamilies <ref type="bibr">(Kumar and Cowen, 2009</ref>) we used <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-26">SAM</rs> sequence entropy <ref type="bibr">(Karplus et al., 1998)</ref> throughout the present study.</p>
            <p>Once an HMM is build from an MSA, a new sequence can be scored by the HMM. The score (S) is the log of the probability of observing the sequence from a HMM divided by the probability of observing the same sequence from the 'null hypothesis' model or HMM. S = log 2 P(seq|HMM) P(seq|null) P(seq|HMM) is the probability of the target sequence according to a HMM and P(seq|null) is the probability of the target sequence given a 'null hypothesis' model of the statistics of random sequence. In <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-27">HMMER</rs>, this null model is a simple one-state HMM that says that random sequences are independently and identically distributed sequences with a specific residue composition. In addition, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ca543acf2c-software-simple-28">HMMER</rs> also generates an E-value which is the expected number of false positives with a score as high as the hit sequence. While the log odd scores (S) provides information on the quality of a hit, the E-value gives a measure relative to other sequences. Therefore a lower E-value implies that the sequence matches more closely to the HMM.</p>

            <p>SVM classifier Z-scored values of each physiological parameter were used for linear SVM classification. SVM is a supervised machine learning method for data classification that can be trained to find the best hyperplane that separates all data points in two userdefined classes and can subsequently be exploited to blindpredict the class to which a new observation belongs <ref type="bibr">(37-39)</ref>. We defined two classes: mutated (heterozygous and null) and wild-type (males and females) mice. By using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="a7b2fbe727-software-simple-0">Matlab</rs> function svmtrain, we trained the SVM with a subset of data consisting of 50% of the dataset and we than used the remaining 50% for testing, using the svmclassify function. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and D-prime (d 0 ) were then computed for the categorical classification in order to evaluate its performance. This procedure was repeated 200 times, each one with a randomly divided training and testing subsets. Values for accuracy, sensitivity (or true positive rate), specificity (or true negative rate) and d 0 were averaged across iterations. Accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were defined as (TP &#254; TN)/total, TP/P and TN/N, respectively, where TP: True positive, TN: True Negative, P: total positives, N: total negatives.

            <p>Live Imaging-MDA-MB-435/GFP-CLCa cells were grown in a 35-mm glass-bottomed dish (Matsunami Glass Ind., Osaka, Japan) for 48 h. Subsequently, the cells were treated with chemicals and imaged on the temperature-controlled stage top incubator (Tokai Hit Co., Shizuoka, Japan) of fluorescent microscopy IX81 (Olympus Corp.) with a &#1003;60 oil, NA 1.35 objective at 37&#176;C under 5% CO 2 . Temperature and CO 2 concentration were maintained with an INUG2A control unit (Tokai Hit Co.). <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-9">MetaMorph</rs> Software (<rs corresp="#dae3fcfebd-software-9" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Molecular Devices</rs>, Downingtown, PA) was used to control image acquisition and manipulation. For time-lapse observation, images were recorded as described previously by Sakaushi et al. <ref type="bibr">(23)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Conformational Sampling of AMF-26-Conformational analysis of AMF-26 was performed on an Apple Power Mac G5 (PowerPC G5, 2.5 GHz; two central processing units), using the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-10">Conformational Analyzer with Molecular Dynamics and Sampling (CAMDAS)</rs> <rs corresp="#dae3fcfebd-software-10" resp="#annotator2" type="version">2.1</rs> program <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref>. Ten molecular dynamic (MD) calculations were simultaneously performed using different initial structures. Each of the MD calculations was carried out for 1 ns with an integral time step of 1 fs. The lengths of the covalent bonds were fixed. The temperature of the system was maintained at 1,200 K to enhance the sampling efficiency. Conformers were sampled every 100 steps, and then each conformer was minimized until the root mean square of the gradients of the potential energy was below 0.001 kcal mol &#1002;1 &#197; &#1002;1 . All conformations were clustered with torsion angles of heavy atoms using a threshold of &#1006;30&#176;. The Merck Molecular Force Field 94s was used to evaluate the potential energy surface of the molecule <ref type="bibr">(28, 29)</ref>. The dielectric constant was 80, but no cut-off distance for non-bonded interactions was used. Because of the low probability of the existence of conformers with higher energies, the conformers within 15 kcal mol &#1002;1 of the minimum energy of the molecule were adopted for superposition.</p>
            <p>Molecular Modeling of the Arf1-AMF-26-Sec7 Domain Complex-To obtain the initial structure of the Arf1-AMF-26-Sec7 domain complex, the sampled conformers of AMF-26 were superposed onto BFA in the X-ray structure of the Arf-BFA-Sec7 domain complex (PDB code 1r8q) (8) using the parallel version of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-simple-4">SUPERPOSE</rs> program <ref type="bibr">(30)</ref>. This superposes two molecules based on the physicochemical properties of the atomic groups, which is useful for estimating the binding conformation of a molecule by distinguishing it from the many conformations that are generated by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-simple-5">CAMDAS</rs>. The program considers five types of physicochemical property: hydrophobic (HP), aromatic (AR), hydrogen-bond donors (HD), hydrogenbond acceptors (HA), and hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors (DA). Each type is represented as a sphere with a predefined radius (1.0 or 0.5 &#197;) and is assigned to a functional group in a molecule <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4, A and B)</ref>. After molecular superposition, the matching spheres were scored using the scoring matrix (supplemental <ref type="table">Table S1)</ref>. One AMF-26 conformation was chosen as the binding conformation based on the scores and the overlapped molecular volumes <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4C)</ref>. The superposition calculations were performed using 28 nodes of a Dell PowerEdge 1950III (Intel Quad Core Xeon X5460; 3.16 GHz; 56 central processing units in total). The overlapped molecular volumes were calculated by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-11">SYBYL</rs> <rs corresp="#dae3fcfebd-software-11" resp="#annotator2" type="version">7.3</rs> (<rs corresp="#dae3fcfebd-software-11" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Tripos Inc</rs>., St. Louis, MO) on an Hewlett Packard work station xw8200 (Intel Xeon; 3.60 GHz; 2 central processing units).</p>
            <p>To relieve the steric hindrances, the coordinates of AMF-26 and of the residues within 4 &#197; from AMF-26 were optimized to reduce the root mean square of the gradients of potential energy below 0.05 kcal mol &#1002;1 &#197; &#1002;1 using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-simple-9">SYBYL</rs>. The simplex minimization method before the conjugate-gradient minimization procedure was used. The Tripos force field was employed for the molecular energy calculation.

The cut-off distance for the non-bonded interactions was 8 &#197;. The distance-dependent dielectric constant of 4r was used. The initial positions of the missing atoms in the crystal structure were generated by the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-simple-12">SYBYL</rs>.</p>
            <p>Molecular Dynamics Simulation for Model Refinement-To refine the model of the Arf1-AMF-26-Sec7 domain complex,<rs cert="0.5" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-17">AMBER</rs> <rs corresp="#dae3fcfebd-software-17" resp="#annotator2" type="version">9</rs> (36) was used for further minimization and MD simulations on 7 nodes of an Appro 1122Hi (AMD Opteron 248; 2.20 GHz; 14 central processing units in total). The ff99 <ref type="bibr">(37)</ref> and gaff <ref type="bibr">(38)</ref> force fields were used for the proteins and AMF-26, respectively. The partial charges for AMF-26 were derived from the restraint electrostatic potential method (39) using an ab initio calculation at the HF/6 -31G* level using Gaussian 03 <ref type="bibr">(40)</ref>. The complex was solvated in a box of 34616 TIP3P (41) water molecules. Six K &#1001; ions were added to neutralize the system. The system was minimized until the root mean square of the gradients of potential energy was below 0.005 kcal mol &#1002;1 &#197; &#1002;1 . The 3.5-ns MD simulation was carried out at constant pressure (1 atm) and temperature (310 K), under periodic boundary conditions, and with particle-mesh Ewald treatment (42) of electrostatics. SHAKE <ref type="bibr">(43)</ref> was applied to all bonds involving hydrogen, and a time step of 1 fs was used. An 8-&#197; cutoff was used for the nonbonded interactions.</p>
            <p>Immunofluorescence Microscopy-After being cultured in a 24-well glass bottom plate for 48 h, cells were treated with chemicals for various periods of time (as indicated in the relevant figure). Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with cold 3.8% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) for 20 min, and then washed and permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated in blocking buffer containing 1% BSA and 2% normal goat serum (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 30 min before overnight incubation at 4&#176;C with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. After being washed, cells were incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies. Cells were then washed, stained with DAPI (Molecular Probes), and mounted with fluorescent Novel Golgi Inhibitor Shows Potent Antitumor Activity mounting medium (Dako). The immunostained cells were imaged using a fluorescent microscope IX81 (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with a &#1003;100 oil, NA 1.40 objective or with a &#1003;40, NA 0.95 objective, and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-18">MetaMorph</rs> Software (<rs corresp="#dae3fcfebd-software-18" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Molecular Devices</rs>, Sunnyvale, CA).</p>
            <p>Comparison between the BFA and AMF-26 Complexes-To support this conclusion, we performed computer modeling/MD simulations. The octahydronaphthalene ring of AMF-26 (HP1, HP2, and DA1) was superimposed onto the lactone ring of BFA (HP1, HP2, and HA1) by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-simple-17">SUPERPOSE</rs> <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4C)</ref>.

COPI is the most important coat protein in facilitating retrograde intracellular transport from Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) <ref type="bibr">(52)</ref>. In control cells, most of the &#9252;COPI was localized on the cis-Golgi membrane, whereas the addition of AMF-26 caused a rapid release of &#9252;COPI into the cytoplasm <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5A)</ref>.

            <p>The study was performed according to a randomized crossover design. After a run-in period of 4 weeks, during which patients were stabilized on their own diet, they followed, in alternate order, two isoenergetic diets, each for 4 weeks. One diet was relatively rich in carbohydrate, rich in dietary fiber both of soluble and insoluble type, and with a low glycemic index; the other was rich in MUFA, relatively low in carbohydrate, low in dietary fiber, and with a relatively high glycemic index <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). The glycemic load of the high-carbohydrate/high-fiber diet was lower than that of the high-MUFA diet (155 vs. 205).

The frames were collected every 4 s with an exposure time of 0.5-1.0 s. To minimize phototoxic damage, a 100 W halogen lamp was used as a light source for fluorescent imaging of live cells.</p>
            <p>Image analysis was performed as described earlier <ref type="bibr">(Minin et al., 2006)</ref> using an open source image analysis software, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator11" type="software" xml:id="ed2bd766e9-software-2">ImageJ</rs> (<rs corresp="#ed2bd766e9-software-2" resp="#annotator11" type="url">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij</rs>). Because of the diverse morphology of mitochondria, we plotted the coordinates of one end for longer organelles and the center of mass for shorter ones. Mitochondrial motility was expressed in terms of the displacement distances and velocities. To define fast organelle movements, we applied a threshold of 200 nm/s. The values of the relative motility of mitochondria were expressed as mean percentages of fast movements in all recorded displacements &#177; SEM. In each experiment, 20-40 individual mitochondrial movements were analyzed in each of 10-15 cells. The significance of differences was estimated statistically by the paired-sample Student's t test. Variability of the values calculated for different cells in the samples was analyzed by the same method and was insignificant.</p>

            <p>Normally distributed quantitative variables are expressed as means and standard deviations. Nonparametric variables are expressed as median, minimum, and maximum values. Differences in the distribution of selected characteristics between patient groups were examined using the chi-square test and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. The analysis was performed using Student's t-test for normally distributed continuous variables and the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests for nonparametric variables. Variables associated with wall location and events in univariate analysis (P , 0.10) were included in the multivariate analyses. Continuous variables were used as dichotomous variables to facilitate clinical interpretation and standardize the multivariate analysis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the area under the curve (AUC) or the c statistic; the cut-off point for BNP and other continuous variables with the best predictive value was used for wall location and cardiac events. A multiple logistic regression model was used for the selection of variables predictive of involvement of the anterior wall and for the occurrence of in-hospital events during index admission. Cox multivariate regression was used for the selection of independent prognostic factors of mortality and any follow-up events. Two-sided P values , 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="d05f513f8b-software-0">Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)</rs> software version <rs corresp="#d05f513f8b-software-0" resp="#annotator8" type="version">11.0</rs> for Windows. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> presents clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients.

            <p>The follow-up for each patient included chest radiography, laboratory tests, and CT. For evaluation of therapeutic efficacy, the absence of enhancement inside the tumor was taken to indicate technical success. A follow-up CT was conducted at intervals of 1, 3, and 6 months and then every 6 months over the years. One-month follow-up CT was performed to determine whether there was any remnant or residual enhancement of the ablated lesion. Complete treatment resulted when nonenhancement was achieved. The technical success rate was defined as complete ablation of the tumor following the initial procedure or additional sessions with a 1-month follow-up. Recurrence was defined as growth of the tumor or any new enhancing portions at 3 months after confirmed nonenhancement of the initial RFA lesion. Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson's chi-square test, and repeated-measures analysis of variance between the two groups were used for analysis of the characteristics of each group. A p-value &#65308;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

            <p>At least eight capillary BG tests, using the BG meter built into the reader, were required to be performed on each day of the sensor wear, both at home and in the clinic. One strip lot was used to minimize lot-to-lot variation. The preferred testing was upon waking, before each meal, an hour after each meal, and at bedtime. Immediately after each BG test, participants obtained a confirmation of a successful sensor scan. Sensor readings were masked to participants, who were asked to maintain their established diabetes management plan. There was no manipulation of the glucose levels of the subjects except for their normal meal and insulin doses. Capillary BG tests coincided with venous YSI samples drawn during in-clinic visits. A linear mixed model was used to assess sensitivity and mean absolute relative difference (MARD) between insertion sites, with subject as a random effect and insertion site (left arm, right arm) and lot as fixed effects. The lag between the System sensor and YSI reference was evaluated using a model that characterizes delay with a time constant. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> Analyses were carried out using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="de6efdab04-software-0">SAS</rs> version <rs corresp="#de6efdab04-software-0" resp="#annotator5" type="version">9.2</rs> software (<rs corresp="#de6efdab04-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SAS Institute</rs>, Cary, NC).</p>

Given the cohort study design a generalized linear regression with a logit link and binomial distribution was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) of adverse events between patients undergoing CTC and OC by indication (i.e. symptomatic versus asymptomatic) controlling for differences in patient characteristics including gender, age, race, comorbidities associated with studied adverse events, and adverse events in the preceding 90 days. Due to low event rates for the targeted adverse events there is limited concern of overestimation of the risk ratio, which is approximated by the OR in cohort studies. Statistical significance was declared for results with a two-sided p-value of b 0.05.

            <p>Even though these 5 0 -SS sequences display some affinity for the SRSF1 RBD, our results do not necessarily imply that SRSF1 binds to these sequences within their natural cellular context.

            <p>All analyses were conducted using the intention-to-treat principle. Analyses were conducted in<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="d54c0e7a43-software-0">Stata SE</rs> V.<rs corresp="#d54c0e7a43-software-0" resp="#annotator8" type="version">14</rs> (College Station, Texas, USA). We compared baseline covariates to examine the balance between intervention and control arms using count and percentages for categorical variables and median and IQR for continuous variables. We compared the same set of baseline covariates to determine whether loss to follow-up differed according to observed variables, including the study group. Proportions of participants who opted in for testing, were tested positive/negative, and took an ACT were compared by the study group. All primary end points are individual-level binary outcomes, modelled using a linear probability model (LPM),allowing us to interpret model parameters as probability differences. The LPM was specified as a generalised linear model for a binomial outcome with an identity link function. We summarised testing choice by the four randomised study groups by regressing the binary outcome on two factors (RDT subsidy and ACT subsidy) and their interaction to match the randomised 2&#215;2 factorial study design. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> In addition to unadjusted group effects, we specified models with a full set of prespecified predictors: gender and age of the client, occupation and education level of the client or guardian (if client &lt;18 years), household size, wealth, and sublocation. Wealth was assessed as a composite score based on principal component analysis of ownership of basic household assets, using a polychoric correlation matrix to account for the categorical nature of the included assets. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> The poorest 40% of participants were used as the comparator group. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> For the secondary end point of ACT consumption (an individual-level binary outcome) we used the same LPM modelling approach as for the testing-related outcomes. Models were stratified by test results for the subsample of clients who opted for a test. Since the interaction term was not significant in any of these models or in the primary testing outcome models, we excluded it in order to gain power and to improve model interpretation. Similarly, because we had not powered our study for these secondary end points, we reduced the set of prespecified predictors included in the primary outcome to the most parsimonious model with the best fit. To do so, we performed likelihood ratio tests and compared Akaike information criterion for subsets of the prespecified predictors. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> The reduced set included wealth index only. Therefore, we only present the adjustment for the parsimonious model for the secondary end points and provide results from this parsimonious set for the primary outcome for comparison. Since testing outcomes relied on self-reports of testing behaviour, we conducted sensitivity analyses to determine whether model results persisted when the outcome was malaria testing at the CHW only (rather than the broader definition of any malaria test, including those conducted in a health facility) and when there was documented proof of the malaria test.</p>

For 8.52 % of the reads the barcode could not be identified unambiguously. These reads were excluded from further analysis. Another quality filtering step was imposed by our read-joining algorithm which requires that both reads of each read pair exhibit significant overlaps. 94.8% &#177; 1.81% of all read pairs could by joined successfully to one consensus sequence. Finally, the joined reads were classified and filtered again for occurrence of possible k1/k1 -boxes, which was the case for 90.6% &#177; 2.4%. In the end, compared to the original raw read numbers, on average 83.5% &#177; 2.2% of reads were used for the data analysis, which was equivalent to around 8.5 million read pairs.</p>

            <p>The linkage used probabilistic matching 37 using the record linkage software <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="b2c0640c43-software-simple-0">ChoiceMaker</rs>, <ref type="bibr">38</ref> together with clerical review of possible matches. Probabilistic matching assigns a weight to pairs of records based on how likely they are to be a true match based on a comparison of name, date of birth and address. Records with high weights are considered a true match while those with low weights are false matches; uncertain matches undergo clerical review. The cut-off for determining whether a match is true or false is chosen as to minimise the number of false positives, false negatives and the number of clerical reviews. <ref type="bibr">39</ref> The linkage algorithms take into account name reversals, name shortenings and a limited number of keystroke errors in date of birth. The CHeReL routinely performs these linkages, and standard operating procedures exist to fine tune the linkage sensitivity and specificity depending on the cohort data being linked. CHeReL follows established quality assurance processes for their master linkage key, linkage procedures and linkage staff. In general, these processes achieve false positive rates of 0-5/1000 and false negative rates of &lt;1/1000. However, the quality of the probabilistic matching process is highly dependent on the quality of the data provided, and in the case of DVA clients, important linkage variables such as name, date of birth and death and address histories are well documented. For example, an audit of the first CCR, APDC and EDDC linkages found a false positive rate of 0.4% and a false negative rate of &lt;0.5%. Moreover, individual research projects conducted under the auspices of this programme start with a comprehensive review of the cohort to minimise the inclusion of false positive cases. This is carried out by identifying and excluding cases where there are discrepancies between dates of birth and death across different databases or in circumstances where a client has observations of health resource use after their date of death.</p>

            <p>The primary endpoint was comparison of steady-state pharmacokinetics of simeprevir between subjects with severe renal impairment and matched subjects with normal renal function. The secondary endpoint was short-term safety and tolerability. No formal sample size determination was performed; a sample size of eight subjects per group was considered sufficient for pharmacokinetic assessment. Subjects who received at least one dose of the study medication were included in the analysis (intentionto-treat population). Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="ccccf2e977-software-0">WinNonlin Professional</rs> TM version <rs corresp="#ccccf2e977-software-0" resp="#annotator7" type="version">4.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#ccccf2e977-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Pharsight Corporation</rs>, Mountain View, CA, USA). Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation [SD]) were calculated for total and unbound plasma concentrations at each time point. For the full pharmacokinetic profile, the minimum plasma concentration (C min ), maximum plasma concentration (C max ), and area under the plasma concentration-time curve at 24 h (AUC 24 ) on the logarithmic scale were the primary pharmacokinetic parameters of interest. A linear mixed-effects model (controlling for renal function) was used to estimate the least-squares (LS) means for each of the parameters. A 90 % confidence interval (CI) was created around the difference between the LS means in the renal impairment and control groups. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for the comparison of the time to maximal plasma concentration (T max ) between groups. No formal hypothesis testing was performed.</p>

            <p>In vivo micro-CT Specimen scans were performed with a SkyScan 1172 high-resolution micro-CT (SkyScan N.V., Kontich, Belgium). Prior to scanning the specimens, a calibration scan was performed using synthetic bone, water, and air samples. The exposure parameters were 70 kV and 140 mA. The number of projections was 481 and there were 938 cross-sections. The total scan time was 20 min. The scanned images were reconstructed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b69c6c99dd-software-simple-0">SkyScan CT-Analyser</rs> software and a modified cone-beam algorithm <ref type="bibr">14</ref> with 0.027 mm30.027 mm30.027 mm isotropic voxel spacing. The reconstructed three-dimensional (3D) image was then traced to the circumference of the original defect margins. This allowed the creation of a 3D reconstruction of the defect, which here after was referred to as the region of interest.

            <p>The surgical protocol was the same for both groups, besides the type of the alignment guide for the distal femoral resection (extramedullary/intramedullary). In particular, all patients received epidural and spinal anesthesia and the preoperative and postoperative procedures and surgical techniques were identical. Patient-controlled analgesia was implemented postoperatively using a 100 mL mixture of 90 mL of 0.125% bupivacaine and 0.5 mg/10 mL fentanyl via an epidural catheter. All operations were performed by the same surgeon (first author) using a medial parapatellar approach introduced by Insall. The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) was removed and the same PCL-sacrificing prosthesis (Scorpio NRG, Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) was implanted in all knees. The patella was replaced, and the prosthetic components were cemented in all cases. Lateral release was not performed in all patients. Two markers indicating the center of the femoral head and the anterior margin of the greater trochanter were firmly attached to the patient's skin in the EM group prior to surgery so the surgeon could palpate the markers and identify the mechanical axis of the lower limb during surgery. A femoral cutting block was aligned along the coronal and axial axes using new surgical equipment <ref type="bibr">16)</ref> and the two markers. The distal femur was cut without placing a rod into the medullary canal <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. The angle between the anatomical axis and the mechanical axis of the femur in the IM group was measured using a PACS system on a preoperative anterioposterior long leg standing radiograph. An intramedullary alignment rod was inserted based on the preoperative measurements, and the distal femur was cut. The entrance hole for the alignment rod in the femoral medullary canal was sealed with bone fragments before inserting the implant. An extramedullary alignment guide was used in both groups for proximal tibial cutting. A drainage tube was placed in the intra-articular space. After wound closure, a compression dressing using gauze and a bandage was applied, and the tourniquet was deflated. Drainage was discontinued from immediately after surgery until 2 hours after tourniquet deflation. All drains were removed 24 hours after surgery. Blood transfusion was performed when hemoglobin was &lt;8 g/dL or when dyspnea, palpitation, dizziness, or abnormal vital signs were noted even if the hemoglobin was 8-10 g/dL. Rivaroxaban, an oral anticoagulant, was administered from immediately after the drain removal until the postoperative week 2 to prevent thromboembolic disorders. The anticoagulant was discontinued if hemarthrosis due to intra-articular bleeding was present or effusion from the surgical wound continued. Tests for thromboembolic disorders were not performed unless clinical symptoms appeared. Statistical analyses were conducted using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="f3f10b74a2-software-0">SPSS</rs> ver. <rs corresp="#f3f10b74a2-software-0" resp="#annotator20" type="version">12.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#f3f10b74a2-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SPSS Inc</rs>., Chicago, IL, USA).

The continuous variables, drained blood volume and preoperative hemoglobin level, were analyzed using Student's t-test. The hemoglobin level at 5 days after surgery and the hemoglobin drop (hemoglobin level at 5 days after surgeryhemoglobin level before surgery) were compared between groups using analysis of covariance. The prevalence of allogeneic transfusion, a categorical variable, was compared between the groups using Fisher's exact test. Additionally, the presence of other related symptoms were also investigated, including the duration of effusion, subcutaneous hematomas, hemarthrosis, hemorrhagic complications such as infections, painful leg swelling, acute chest pain, dyspnea, lower limb thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism.</p>

            <p>Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNAs were then reverse-transcribed using a Superscript II kit (Invitrogen) with the oligo(dT)15 primer according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The PCR was performed with a GoTaq&#174; Green Master Mix PCR kit (Promega) in 20 &#956;L of total reaction mixture containing 1 &#956;L of the RT-reaction mixture and 0.5 &#956;L of each primer (forward and reverse, 15 &#956;M). The PCR primers sets and the thermocycling parameters used are listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The PCR samples were analyzed electrophoretically on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.2 mg/mL ethidium bromide at 90 V for 1 h. The bands were visualized under UV light. GAPDH transcripts served as internal controls. mRNA band density was quantified using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a70a742b04-software-0">SigmaGel</rs> software (<rs corresp="#a70a742b04-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Jandel Scientific</rs>, San Rafael, CA, USA).</p>
            <p>Western blotting was used to analyze IL-4 and IL-13 protein expression. The treated cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 0.1 M EDTA, 0.1 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). The protein content of the whole cell lysate was measured with a Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Whole cell lysates were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). After blocking, the membranes were incubated first with mouse anti-ratIL-4 or mouse anti-rat IL-13 antibody (1:500) and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the ECL Western Blot Detection System (GE Healthcare) and the protein band densities were quantified using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a70a742b04-software-simple-2">SigmaGel</rs> software.</p>
            <p>Data are expressed as means &#177; standard deviation, and are the average values of three to five values per experiment. Analyses were performed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a70a742b04-software-2">SPSS</rs> software version <rs corresp="#a70a742b04-software-2" resp="#annotator2" type="version">10.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#a70a742b04-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SPSS</rs>, Chicago, IL, USA). The experiments were repeated at least twice to confirm the results. Analysis of variance was conducted, and Duncan's multiple-range tests were used to determine significant differences between groups. The level of statistical significance was set to P &lt; 0.05.</p>
            <p>We also investigated the effect of SCWE or DSCWE treatment on IgE-antigen complex-induced IL-4, IL-13, and TNF-&#945; protein production by Western blot analysis (IL-4 and IL-13) and ELISA (TNF-&#945;). The Western blot results were analyzed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a70a742b04-software-simple-6">SigmaGel</rs> software (Figs. 4B, 4C, 5B and 5C). The data showed that stimulating with the IgE-antigen complex increased IL-4, IL-13, and TNF-&#945; protein levels in RBL-2H3 cells, and that treatment with 250, 500, and 1,000 &#956;g/mL SCWE reduced IL-4 and IL-13 protein levels <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4A-C)</ref>. DSCWE at 500 and 1,000 &#956;g/mL also reduced IL-4 and IL-13 protein levels <ref type="figure">Fig. 5A-C)</ref>. The inhibitory effect of SCWE was slightly more potent than that of DSCWE (Figs. 4A-5C). Moreover, SCWE or DSCWE treatment (100, 250, 500, and 1,000 &#956;g/mL) led to a reduction in TNF-&#945; protein levels, compared with that of untreated IgEantigen complex-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6A and 6B)</ref>.</p>

            <p>The most crucial steps to successfully sort ISCs from young and old guts are the appropriate initial settings of the FACS and gating parameters using the described controls and following a specific sorting hierarchy. We performed the FAC sorting on an ARIA II Flow Cytometer (<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a4f25048b5-software-simple-0">FACSDiva</rs> software). It is important that the instrument is turned on at least one hour prior to sorting to warm up the lasers. Of note, when FAC sorting of ISCs is performed for the first time, the parameters for sorting and for compensation need to be set using the aforementioned controls: (1) dissociated cells from wild type (e.g.Of note, the advantage of using Sytox instead of propidium iodide to label dead cells is that there is only a low spillover into the FITC (GFP) channel, which makes it easy to compensate for the spillover.</p>

From the histogram of the PhyloCSF score distribution in each set, we found an optimal PhyloCSF score of 50 which could discriminate annotated sORFs from untranslated sORFs <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. S3)</ref>.

            <p>The hippocampal neurons derived from E-18 pregnant SpragueDawley female rats were prepared as described. <ref type="bibr">42</ref> Briefly, the embryonic hippocampi were dissected, dissociated with papain and triturated with a polished, half-bore Pasteur pipette. Dissociated neurons (2.5 &#194; 10 5 ) in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.6% glucose, 1 mM pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics were plated on poly-D-lysine-coated glass coverslips in a 60 mm Petri dish. Four hours after plating, the medium was replaced with Neurobasal media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% B-27, 0.5 mM L-glutamine, to which 4 mM of 1-b-D-cytosine-arabinofuranoside (Ara-C, Sigma) was added as needed. Neurons were transfected using a modified calciumphosphate method. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Briefly, 6 mg of cDNA and 9.3 ml of 2 M CaCl 2 were mixed in distilled water to a total volume of 75 ml, and the same volume of 2X BBS was added. Neurobasal medium was completely replaced by transfection medium (minimum Eagle's medium, 1 mM pyruvate, 0.6% glucose, 10 mM glutamine and 10 mM N-2-hydroxyl piperazine-N 0 -2-ethane sulfonic acid, pH 7.65), and the cDNA mixture was added to the neurons, and incubated in a 5% CO 2 incubator for 90 min. Neurons were washed twice with washing medium (minimum Eagle's medium, 1 mM pyruvate, 0.6% glucose, 10 mM glutamine and 10 mM N-2-hydroxyl piperazine-N 0 -2-ethane sulfonic acid (N-2-hydroxyl piperazine-N 0 -2-ethane sulfonic acid), pH 7.35) and then returned to the original culture medium. The vGlut-pHluorin (vGpH) and pU6mRFP constructs were cotransfected in a ratio of 5:1. The construct vGpH harbors vesicular glutamate transporter 1 fused with pHluorin, a modified GFP with high pH sensitivity. <ref type="bibr">43</ref> When targeted to the synaptic vesicle lumen, vGpH is quenched and upon exocytosis, the relatively basic pH of the extracellular space allows it to fluoresce. Its fluorescence is again quenched after endocytosis and re-acidification of the synaptic vesicles. Thus, this process accurately reflects the kinetics of exoendocytic trafficking of synaptic vesicles. <ref type="bibr">43,44</ref> Synaptic vesicle pool size measurement and image analysis Coverslips were mounted in a perfusion/stimulation chamber equipped with platinum-iridium field stimulus electrodes (EC-S-10, LCI, Seoul, Korea) on the stage of an Olympus IX-71 inverted microscope with &#194; 40, 1.0 NA oil lens (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Neurons were continuously perfused at room temperature with Tyrode solution (136 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1.3mM MgCl 2 , 10mM N-2-hydroxyl piperazine-N 0 -2-ethane sulfonic acid, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.3). To reduce spontaneous activity and prevent recurrent excitation during stimulation, 10 mM 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione and 50 mM of DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid were added to the Tyrode solution. Time-lapse images were acquired every 5 s for 4 min using a back-illuminated Andor iXon 897 EMCCD camera (Andor Technologies, Belfast, Northern Ireland) driven by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="feda4c0427-software-0">MetaMorph Imaging</rs> software (<rs corresp="#feda4c0427-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Molecular Devices</rs>, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). From the fourth frame, neurons were stimulated (1 ms, 20-50 V, bipolar) using an A310 Accupulser current stimulator (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) to mimic action potential generation. Quantitative measurement of fluorescence intensity at individual boutons was obtained by averaging a selected area of pixel intensities using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="feda4c0427-software-simple-2">MetaMorph</rs> software. Individual regions were selected by hand. Then, rectangular regions of interest were drawn around the synaptic boutons, and average intensities were calculated. Large puncta, typically representative of smaller synapse clusters, were rejected during the selection procedure. The center of intensity of each synapse was calculated to correct for any image shift over the course of the experiment. Fluorescence was expressed in intensity units that correspond to fluorescence values averaged over all pixels within the region of interest. Changes in net fluorescence were obtained by subtracting the average intensity of the first four frames (F 0 ) from the intensity of each frame (F t ) for individual boutons. They were then normalized to the maximum fluorescence intensity (F max &#192;F 0 ) and averaged. For the exocytosis assays, neurons were preincubated with bafilomycin A1 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) for 60 s to block re-acidification and stimulated for 30 s at 20 Hz/600 action potentials (APs), a combination, which is known to totally deplete the recycling pool of vesicles. <ref type="bibr">44</ref> Bafilomycin A1 was dissolved in Me 2 SO at 0.2 mM and diluted to a final concentration of 0.5 mM prior to the experiments. Bafilomycin A1 was applied throughout the fluorescence measurements.</p>

            <p>In the present study, we investigated the taxonomic distribution of DEG7-like proteases and analysed how the unusual domain arrangement affects the oligomerization of DEG7 from A. thaliana. We demonstrated that DEG7 orthologues are restricted to fungi and plants, including various algae and land plants. Using Y2H assays and SEC (size-exclusion chromatography) with recombinant DEG7 purified from E. coli, we show that trimerization of DEG7 monomers is mediated by the second (degenerated) protease domain. <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref> <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref> <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref> <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref>DegP and DEG1 from A. thaliana, representing the best examined Deg/HtrA proteases from animals, bacteria and plants respectively, were chosen as outgroups, since they do not belong to the DEG7 group <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>.

            <p>We searched freely available genome databases for genes encoding DEG7-like proteases and retrieved hits for fungi and plant (including green, heterokont and haptophyte algae) genomes.

Two main clades of DEG7 proteases can be distinguished: clade A contains DEG7 proteases from fungi, whereas DEG7 proteins from green, heterokont and haptophyte algae, mosses and higher plants form clade B. Whereas most species investigated possess only one DEG7-like gene, the genomes of the yeasts Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Schizosaccharomyces japonicus, the ascomycete Giberella zeae, the oomycete Phytophtora soja, the haptophyte alga Emiliania huxleyi and the moss Physcomitrella patens contain two, whereas the higher plant Populus trichocarpa possesses three DEG7 paralogues <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>).

            <p>The data were collected during 2002-2004. The objective of the questionnaire was to gather information about the workers' knowledge of the occupational risks connected with their occupation, possible work-related occupational hazards, and attitudes towards using personal protective equipment and safety routines. Questions about the workers' opinions and their perceptions about the exposure to occupational risks (noise, chemicals, vibration, bad microclimate, insuffi cient lighting, and ergonomics), experienced health symptoms and their awareness of the Occupational Health and Safety Act were also asked. The workers were randomly selected from textile, printing, mechanical, plastic, food processing industries and offi ces. A questionnaire was distributed to 412 workers in investigated industries. The average age was 43.6 years. Confi dentiality of information was always maintained and only coded information was used in the analysis. Data collected on the questionnaire study was coded and then entered into the statistical software programme (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="dc71d2adaf-software-simple-0">Excel</rs>) for analyses. The investigation gave results as follows: 1. 65% of workers considered excessive exposure to noise, 60% bad microclimate (too cold workrooms), 54% bad lighting at workplaces; not-effective ventilation was the main occupational risk factor (75% of workplaces). 2. Only some of the workers (10%) answered that they know which information about the dangerousness of chemicals may be obtained from the chemical labels. Nobody of respondents pointed at the chemical safety data sheets as one of the important source of information. 3. Most of the workers (80%) reported that personal protective equipment (PPE) was accessible; however, the questionnaire did not show the attitudes towards using PPE. Some of the respondents (36%) pointed that the PPE disturbs the work; others mentioned (46%) that the quality of PPE is not very good. 4. In the present study, 63% of the workers reported that they were aware of the person who was the working environment specialist in their company. At the same time, only 20% of workers knew who was elected to be their working environment representative. 5. Different opinions were given on safety instructions and guidelines. In the present study, 25% of the workers reported that they had not received safety instructions and guidelines. The assessment of the safety instructions was made on a 6-point scale (from 0 to 5, where 0 was bad and 5 -very good). According to workers' opinion, the quality of accessed safety instruction was satisfactory (2.8 points). 6. The questionnaire revealed that only 25% were generally aware of the safety legislation.</p>

Gradient switching artifact was removed using average artifact subtraction, which uses the regularity of the gradient switching induced waveform to generate a moving average artifact that can be successfully removed from the baseline EEG <ref type="bibr">(Allen et al., 2000)</ref>. Cardioballistic artifact is commonly seen in routine scalp EEG recordings. It is greatly amplified when EEG is recorded in the MR environment because movement of electrically conductive material in a static field results in electromagnetic induction. In contrast, cardioballistic artifact is not seen in routine clinical intracranial EEG records, nor was it seen in our intracranial EEG recordings in the MR environment. Therefore, removal of this artifact was not necessary. The reason why this artifact is not seen in clinical intracranial EEG recordings or in our iEEG-fMRI recordings is that intracranial electrodes(depth or subdural electrodes) are less prone to movement with cardiac pulsations because they are fixed to the skull or dura. Additionally, the distance between the active and reference electrodes is smaller for iEEG than scalp EEG, which further reduces the amplitude of cardioballistic artifact.</p>

            <p>As the number of ncRNAs and in particular regulatory RNAs increase it has become of crucial importance to establish software tools that can help identify their functionality. For this purpose we introduce <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-0">taveRNA</rs>, a web-based computational tool set that can help identify structure and functionality of ncRNA molecules. <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-1">taveRNA</rs> involves tools whose algorithmic foundations were developed by Simon Fraser University's Lab for Computational Biology over the past few years. The tools aim to solve the following key problems:</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-2">taveRNA</rs> involves web interfaces to the algorithmic tools we have developed for each one of the above problems: (1) <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-3">alteRNA</rs>, an alternative thermodynamic model-based RNA secondary structure prediction program, (2) <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-4">inteRNA</rs>, a program for predicting the joint secondary structure of two interacting RNAs and (3) <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-5">pRuNA</rs>, a tool for quickly identifying all potential regulatory ncRNAs for a query mRNA.</p>
            <p>RNA secondary structure prediction is one of the earliest problems considered in computational biology. Despite a 30-year-effort towards its solution, the best algorithms and software for RNA structure prediction are still far from perfect. The most common approach to the RNA secondary structure prediction problem is the standard thermodynamic approach. This general methodology suggests to compute the secondary structure of an RNA molecule by minimizing the total free energy of its substructures such as stems, loops and bulges. <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-6">alteRNA</rs> is an alternative thermodynamic approach to the RNA secondary structure prediction problem, which aims to minimize a linear combination of total free energy and total energy density using the dynamic programming formulation proposed in <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref>, in contrast to the available alternatives such as <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-7">Mfold</rs> (4), <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-8">RNAscf</rs> (5) and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-9">alifold</rs> <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref>, which all employ the standard thermodynamic approach.</p>
            <p>As mentioned earlier, there are a number of algorithms for predicting the secondary structure of a single RNA molecule. However, until recently no such algorithm existed for reliably predicting the joint secondary structure of two interacting RNA molecules, or measuring the stability of such a joint structure. At <rs corresp="#d0427a8f9b-software-14" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SFU Lab for Computational Biology</rs>, we developed <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-14">inteRNA</rs> the first program that aims to compute the joint structure prediction of two given RNA sequences through minimizing their total free energy, which is a function of the topology of the joint structure. The algorithmic foundations of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-12">inteRNA</rs> were introduced in <ref type="formula">(7)</ref>.<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-13">inteRNA</rs> aims to minimize the joint free energy under a number of energy models with growing complexity. Our default energy model is based mostly on stacked pair energies given by <ref type="bibr">Mathews et al. (8)</ref>-the free energy model employed by <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-14">Mfold</rs>. Because there is very little thermodynamic information on kissing loop sequences in the literature, <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-15">inteRNA</rs> employs the approach used by <ref type="bibr">Rivas and Eddy (9)</ref> to differentiate the thermodynamic parameters of 'external' bonds from the 'internal' bonds, i.e. we simply multiply the external parameters with a weight slightly smaller than 1. Note that the default algorithmic engine used by <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-16">inteRNA</rs> requires substantial resources in terms of running time and memory which could be prohibitive for predicting joint structure of sufficiently long RNAs. Thus we made available an alternative heuristic engine that aims to capture the joint secondary structure of interacting RNAs. This heuristic approach is based on the observation that the substructures that are available independently in each RNA are mostly preserved in their joint secondary structure.</p>
            <p>Regulatory ncRNAs play important roles in controlling gene expression via establishing stable joint structures with target mRNAs and prohibiting ribosomal access. As many novel regulatory RNA classes are being discovered, the determination of the exact functionality of all regulatory ncRNAs is one of the most significant scientific challenges to be tackled in the coming years. Our software tool <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-17">pRuNA</rs> is developed for helping to address this challenge: it aims to identify all potential regulatory ncRNAs that can establish stable joint structures with a query mRNA <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref>. An important component of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-18">pRuNA</rs> is a sequence filter which eliminates a significant fraction of the available ncRNA collection and retains only the most likely ncRNA candidates for forming a stable joint structure with the query mRNA. We note that the majority of regulatory ncRNAs are only partially complementary to their target mRNA sequences. Typically these RNAs contain at least two short (5-7 nt) motifs on their loop structures that are complementary to the specific single-stranded locations in the target RNAs <ref type="bibr">(11)</ref>. Thus <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-19">pRuNA</rs> first identifies all pairs of 5-mer motifs from the ncRNA loop sequences that are complementary to a pair of 5-mer motifs in the loop sequences of the query mRNA. The ncRNAs that include such 5-mer motif pairs are then tested against the query mRNA via the use of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-20">inteRNA</rs> and those which can establish stable joint structures are returned by the program.</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-21">alteRNA</rs> requires a sequence in FASTA format, where the sequence is represented as a string of characters from the alphabet AE &#188; {A,C,G,U,T} (the characters are case insensitive). The length of the input RNA sequence is limited by 500 nt. There are two user-specified parameters, s and b, which will be explained in detail later.</p>
            <p>1. The predicted RNA structure in dot-parenthesis format. The sequence is given from 5 0 to 3 0 end, and the structure is given with matching parenthesis denoting a base pair and a dot denoting an unbounded base. 2. The predicted RNA structure in Connect(.ct) file format, which is the standard <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-22">Mfold</rs> output format. The sequence length is given in the first line. For each nucleotide i, there is a line which consists of: the line number (i), the letter denotion of the nucleotide, the predecessor base index (i &#192; 1), the successor base index (i &#254; 1), the paired base index (0 if unpaired) and the original base index (i). 3. The graphics files for the predicted secondary structure in Postscript(.ps) and GIF format. These graphs are created using <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-23">NAVIEW</rs> <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref> and <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-24">Mfold</rs>/ plt2.</p>
            <p>The secondary structure predicted by <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-25">alteRNA</rs> for 5sRNA is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>a.</p>
            <p>It has been shown in (3) that delocalizing the thermodynamic cost of forming an RNA substructure can be achieved by consideration of the energy density of the substructure, which, in return, can improve the secondary structure prediction of several ncRNA families. This alternative thermodynamic approach which we call Densityfold (3) aims to minimize the linear combination of the total free energy and total energy density of all substructures in the RNA molecule. Given an RNA secondary structure, the energy density of a basepair is defined as the free energy of the substructure that starts with the basepair, normalized by the length of the underlying sequence. The energy density of an unpaired base is then defined to be the energy density of the closest basepair that encloses it. Densityfold thus aims to minimize ED(n) &#254; s&#193;E(n), where ED(n) is the total energy density of paired and unpaired bases, E(n) is the total free energy and n is the length of the RNA sequence. Here s determines the weight of the contribution of the total free energy in the optimization function. As s approaches to 1, the predicted secondary structure gets closer to that implied by the standard thermodynamic approach (employed by <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-26">Mfold</rs>). We have observed that s &#188; 5 generally gives the most accurate prediction, in terms of structure edit distance <ref type="bibr">(13)</ref>, however in some RNA sequences, different s values can outperform s &#188; 5.</p>
            <p>Here a, b, c are constants in thermodynamic model, l s is the number of unpaired bases, l d is the number of base pairs and ddG stack is the free energy of each branch in the loop. The default setting for b, the coefficient for the number unpaired bases, is 0 in <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-27">Mfold</rs>; this implies that there will be no penalty for the unpaired bases. However, when used with Densityfold, this setting seems to produce large stretches of unpaired bases in multibranch loops. In order to counter this effect we suggest the user to set b to a small positive value less than 1. <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-28">alteRNA</rs>, our web-based tool for RNA secondary structure prediction via the Densityfold approach allows the user to specify any positive value for s and b. The default values of s and b are 5 and 0, respectively and the folding temperature is fixed at 378C.</p>
            <p>Input and output<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-29">inteRNA</rs> requires as an input two RNA sequences in FASTA format. The sequences are represented as strings of characters from the alphabet AE &#188; {A,C,G,U,T} (the strings are case insensitive). The length of each input RNA sequence is limited by 150 nt for Stacked Pair Model and by 500 nt for Loop Models. There are three user-specified parameters; gap penalty, maximum subsequence length and energy model; each of these parameters are explained in detail later.</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-30">inteRNA</rs> reports the results in three different output forms:</p>
            <p>1. A text file that contains the base-pair information of the joint secondary structure. Here, each line denotes either a base pair with nucleotide indices or a gap.A sample interaction between CopA and CopT, predicted by <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-31">inteRNA</rs> is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>b.</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-32">inteRNA</rs> uses a dynamic programming algorithm, which aims to predict the joint secondary structure of two interacting RNA molecules through minimizing their total free energy. In other words, it predicts the secondary structure of both RNA strands and the interaction simultaneously. Since the general joint structure prediction problem is NP-Complete, it is necessary to set some limitations on the structures predicted: <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-33">inteRNA</rs> does not allow any (internal or external) pseudoknots; it does not allow any zig-zag structures either <ref type="bibr">(7)</ref>.</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-34">inteRNA</rs> can employ the following two models for approximating the total free energy of the joint structure.</p>
            <p>Loop model: It has been observed that RNA molecules mostly preserve their independent secondary structure when they interact with other RNA. Interactions thus typically occur between kissing hairpin loops. The loop model first predicts the secondary structure of each RNA sequence independently using three different approaches: (i) through the standard thermodynamic model (<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-35">Mfold</rs> Loop Model), (ii) through Stacked Pair Model using a single RNA sequence (Default Loop Model) and (iii) through <rs cert="0.5" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-36">alteRNA</rs> (<rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-37">alteRNA</rs> Loop Model). It then identifies all independent subsequences of each RNA structure: these are substructures (each implied by a basepair) whose sequence length is less than a specified value. It then computes the joint secondary structure that can be established between each pair of independent subsequences (one subsequence from each RNA) and the free energy of this joint structure. Finally, it finds the set of independent subsequence pairs which can co-exist and minimize the total free energy of the overall secondary structure.</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-38">pRuNA</rs> asks for a query mRNA sequence as well as its corresponding secondary structure in parenthesis format. It returns a list of possible regulating ncRNAs available through the Rfam database <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref>.</p>
            <p>At the heart of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-39">pRuNA</rs> we have a lookup table of size 1024 &#194; 1024, which represents every possible pair of 5-mer motifs from the 4-letter RNA alphabet. Each entry in the lookup table maintains a pointer to every occurrence of the respective 5-mer motif pair in the loop sequences of the ncRNA structures in the Rfam database. For querying the index, <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-40">pRuNA</rs> first identifies the loop sequences from the mRNA, based on the given secondary structure information. It then extracts each pair of non-overlapping 5-mer motifs from the mRNA loop sequences and checks the lookup table for its reverse complement. The union of the set of ncRNAs that include each motif pair are retained by <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-41">pRuNA</rs>, whereas the remainder of the ncRNAs in the database are eliminated. We have observed that many of the motif pairs in the lookup table occur very frequently in ncRNA sequences and thus have limited information content. We omitted the 5-mer pairs which occur in more than the number <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref> of ncRNAs that include a 'typical' motif pair. This increased our pruning efficiency substantially yet had no effect on the quality of the results: we have tested <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-42">pRuNA</rs> mRNAs that are known to be regulated by an ncRNA available through the NPInter database <ref type="bibr">(15)</ref>. For all 24 of these mRNAs,<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d0427a8f9b-software-simple-43">pRuNA</rs> was able to return the known regulatory ncRNA among the set of potential regulators, while achieving a pruning efficiency of 86% on the average. If the search is restricted to E. coli ncRNAs, the pruning efficiency for the 22 mRNAs regulated by these ncRNAs go up to 91% on the average.

            <p>Western blotting. Protein was extracted using conventional protocols (9 M urea, 4% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate, 1% dithiothreitol, 0.5% carrier ampholytes and cocktail of protease inhibitors). Protein concentrations were determined using Pierce&#8482; BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) with bovine serum album as a standard. Subsequently, proteins were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels using standard sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis techniques and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked by 5% milk (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) for 1 h and probed with specific antibodies for 4&#730;C overnight. Mouse anti-COX-2 polyclonal antibodies (dilution, 1 &#181;g/ml; catalog no., 3362R-100; BioVision, Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA) were used, and mouse anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase monoclonal antibodies (dilution, 0.3 ng/&#181;l; catalog no., 60004-1-Ig; ProteinTech Group, Rosemont, IL, USA) were used as an internal reference. After three washing steps of 15 min each with Tris-buffered saline and Tween (TBST), the membranes were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (dilution, 1:5,000; catalog no., sc-2005; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., USA) at 37&#730;C for 1 h. After three washing steps of 15 min each with TBST, the protein was tested by chemiluminescence detection (catalog no., 29100; Engreen Biosystem Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). The protein expression was analyzed by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="fd6caf98c5-software-0">Image-Pro Plus</rs> <rs corresp="#fd6caf98c5-software-0" resp="#annotator5" type="version">6.0</rs> software (<rs corresp="#fd6caf98c5-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Media Cybernetics, Inc</rs>., Rockville, MD, USA).</p>
            <p>Cell migration assay. Cell motility was evaluated by two experiments. In the wound healing experiment, channels were created by making a scratch in a 6-well plate. Subsequently, 8x10 5 cells per channel were seeded into the 6-well plates and cultured for 24 h. At 0, 12 and 24 h, the wounds were observed and pictures were taken using a phase-contrast microscope.

In the diagnosis phase we will apply induction to establish the overall impression of the data material according to Malterud's <ref type="bibr">40</ref> systematic text condensation approach. This will involve the Norwegian speaking members of the research team. All team members will individually read the data material and come together in an analysis seminar to discuss the main themes <ref type="bibr">40</ref> emerging from the data and which are most important to incorporate in the training programme content and methods. This total impression along with the systematic literature reviews will form the basis for the action planning phase where the training programmes will be designed. The analysis of the data material from the implementation and evaluation phases will also be analysed according to the systematic text condensation approach. This analysis is deductive and theory <ref type="bibr">40</ref> driven as it will apply predefined categories based on Alvarez et al's 37 theoretical framework IMTEE. Research quality in terms of transferability to other contexts is key in qualitative research. <ref type="bibr">38</ref> Generalisability in the sense of exact replication of results across studies is not the goal of action research inquiries. According to Susman and Evered, <ref type="bibr">32</ref> the basis of generalisation in action research is narrow, situational and bound by context. <ref type="bibr">32</ref> This is also true for our study; however action research encourages transferability of project outcomes to similar settings when appropriate. Depending on contextual similarity, it is possible to judge the relevance of findings from our study and whether they can be applied to another study setting. There is a potential conflict between our purposive sampling and transferability of results to other settings. This will be addressed by providing details of the context in which our research occurs in our publications. Also, we will collect data about our sample regarding for example, their experience with technology, age, gender and education, which we consider of relevance for other studies and populations. This information will also be provided in our publications and enable a better ability to evaluate if our results are transferable to other contextual settings. <ref type="bibr">38</ref></p>

            <p>The vast majority of the cases included were bilateral reconstructions (81.9%); thus, there was concern that these breasts were not independent. Therefore, when possible, the analyses were adjusted for clustering to correct for any potential dependence between breast pairs. All continuous data were reviewed for potential outliers, which were defined as values &gt;3 SDs from the mean (11 breasts from 9 patients were excluded). Any cases with outliers were removed from analysis. The resulting patient characteristics, demographics, and complication frequencies between the 2 matrix types were compared using Fisher exact test (categorical variables), t tests, and Mann-Whitney U test (continuous variables, normally or not-normally distributed, respectively). Additionally, a binomial logistic regression model using a general estimating equation (GEE) approach was used to determine significant predictors of whether a complication would occur or not. In addition to the matrix type, other a priori predictors were based on published data and included age, <ref type="bibr">25,26</ref> body mass index (BMI), <ref type="bibr">27,28</ref> duration of drain in place, <ref type="bibr">29</ref> preoperative radiation treatment, <ref type="bibr">20,27</ref> hypertensive status, <ref type="bibr">25</ref> and active smoking status. <ref type="bibr">20,27</ref> In all cases, significance was defined as P &lt; 0.05.

The differences between the GTAP model and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f2ceada032-software-simple-1">GAMS</rs> version of the model are as follows. First, the GTAP model is based on a constant difference elasticity demand system, but the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f2ceada032-software-simple-2">GAMS</rs> model uses Cobb-Douglas preferences.

An income terms of a trade measure, the purchasing power of exports in terms of imports (the ratio of the value of exports to the price of imports), can be a better measure of income or welfare effect of price changes in international trade, especially for developing countries, relative to the net barter terms of trade. See <ref type="bibr">Chacholiades (1990, pp. 136-7)</ref>. 14. The explanation of the CGE model used in this paper is derived from <ref type="bibr">Park (2006)</ref>. simplicity, the GTAP6inGAMS model exogenously fixes the global capital flows. The model described in the present paper uses a classification consisting of 7 sectors and 25 economies, as in <ref type="bibr">Park (2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> The model solution has been calibrated, with 2001 as the base year, using global trade, assistance and production data from the GTAP 6 Database. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> The model has been implemented using the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f2ceada032-software-simple-3">GAMS MPSGE</rs>. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> The GTAP6inGAMS model is adopted because the CGE model is in line with the commonly used GTAP model and the solver, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f2ceada032-software-simple-4">GAMS MPSGE</rs>, is simple and easy to handle.</p>
            <p>To quantitatively measure the impacts of the proposed East Asian RTAs on welfare, output production and trade flows for each of the participating countries, members as a whole, nonmembers and the world economy, we empirically designed and tested four scenarios. For each of the scenarios, both import tariffs and export taxes between members were eliminated, but the trade 15. The seven sectors are: agricultural products, food products, extractive industry, light manufacturing, heavy manufacturing, technology-intensive manufacturing, and services. The 27 economies are: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, the rest of Southeast Asia, China, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, India, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Russia, the USA, the European Free Trade Association, the Western European countries, and the rest of the world. 16. The GTAP 6 Database is a global database representing the world economy for a given reference year <ref type="bibr">(2001)</ref>. For more detailed information, see <ref type="bibr">Dimaranan (2006</ref>For the base solution of the model economy, we ran the CGE model without changing its initial condition and derived general equilibrium values for each of the economies in the model. Next, we reestimated the model under different scenarios and recalculated the equilibrium values for each case. Then, we compared the different equilibrium values with the initial base solution in terms of percentage deviation from the base to evaluate the experimental impacts of each scenario on each country.</p>
            <p>Table 2 provides a comparative summary of regional economic effects of the proposed East Asian RTAs by type of RTA. The aggregate effect of the currently effective AFTA had no significant negative effects on the discriminatory liberalization of the Northeast Asian neighbors, but produced significant enough positive gains to ASEAN members. However, if ASEAN members decide to pursue the ASEAN Hub scenario, which includes three sets of ASEAN+1 FTA, it could raise ASEAN's gains from free trade. ASEAN's welfare and GDP gains could be raised to more than three times that of the AFTA. The negative effects on excluded neighbors could be problematic, although the neighboring countries 18. The trade barriers include both tariff and non-tariff barriers. For import tariffs, trade-weighted ad valorem tariffs include tariff rate quotas and the ad valorem equivalents of specific tariffs. The export taxes cover ordinary export subsidies, export tax equivalents of Agreement on Textiles and Clothing quotas, price undertakings and voluntary export restraints. The protection rates in service sectors are assumed to be zero in the GTAP Database. For more detailed information, visit https:// www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/v6/v6_doco.asp. 19. As the referee indicated, the base year for existing RTA, such as the ASEAN-China FTA, should be 2004 or 2005 (right before the year into force in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). However, similar to other hypothetical scenarios in the present paper, the complete elimination of trade barriers between ASEAN and China are assumed and simulated. Of course, we acknowledge this data problem as a limitation.could increase their exports because of the income effect from the additional GDP gains of ASEAN, with the increase in bilateral trade volume between ASEAN and each of the three Northeast Asian countries. In terms of the negative effects that could be expected from AFTA or the ASEAN Hub scenario, the Northeast Asian neighbors might decide to form their own regional protection strategy against ASEAN by developing a ChinaJapan-Korea FTA. The trade warfare between the two regions could be harmful to the less-developed ASEAN economy and would enormously benefit the Northeast Asian countries, especially the smallest country, like Korea. However, this duplicating RTA competition might not be beneficial to the world economy. It will cause much lower welfare gains to the world economy than those with the existing AFTA and ASEAN Hub scenario.</p>

            <p>The estimation method is a Multivariate Probit maximum likelihood in which the decisions to engage in formal and informal linkages with a set of external organizations are estimated simultaneously. 5 Formal or informal linkages data are binary but they have as many 'dimensions' as the number of external partner/ sources. The choices are not mutually exclusive. This method allows the simultaneous estimation of more than one binary probit equation with correlated disturbances. By allowing disturbances across equations to be freely correlated, the method allows to test for the correlation between dependent variables conditional on a certain number of common explanatory variables <ref type="bibr">(Galia and Legros 2004, p. 1193)</ref>, thus providing insights into the extent of complementary of substitution between them. A positive (negative) correlation of the error terms between two equations is taken as an indication of complementarity (substitution) between the two dependent variables.The data used in this paper come from the Community Innovation Survey 3 (CIS 3) that investigates the process of innovation development by firms in the period 1998-2000, in four European countries: The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the UK. The CIS survey asks firms about the type of innovation introduced in the 3 years preceding the survey, the sources of information they drew upon, their formal collaborative arrangements in order to innovate, as well as their expenditures and investments in several types of innovation activities. The process of innovation in services and in manufacturing has been 4 Fundamental-process activities include chemicals, plastic and rubber industries. Complexproducts include transport equipment. Product-engineering include machinery and equipment industries. Science-based activities include represented pharmaceutical and electrical and optical industries. Continuous-process includes all the other manufacturing activities. This is also the reference category. 5 More specifically, the estimation method employed here is based on the 'recursive conditioning simulator' implemented for <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="c333f36eeb-software-simple-0">STATA</rs> by <ref type="bibr">Cappellari and Jenkins (2003)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> As a robustness check we have also performed for each country 12 separate Probit regressions one for each type of linkage. Results in terms of sign and significance of the estimators of multivariate and binary Probit are very similar. These results are available upon request from the corresponding author.Firm's largest market is international found to be quite different <ref type="bibr">(Miozzo and Soete 2001; Cainelli et al. 2006)</ref>. Therefore, the analysis undertaken in this paper focuses on manufacturing firms with more than nine employees. As the CIS survey does not collect data on the sources of information and collaborative arrangements for noninnovators, we cannot proceed, as we wished, with the analysis for the noninnovative firms. Thus all the firms in our sample are innovative in the sense that they have introduced at least one innovation in the period covered by the survey. Our sample includes a total of 3963 firms (1633 firms for The Netherlands, 1005 firms for the UK, 559 for Sweden, and 766 for Norway).</p>

The Shapiro-Wilks and Levene tests were applied to the data and mean ages, which were both found to be normally distributed and showed homogeneity of variance between groups. Therefore, parametric tests were performed for further analysis. Within-group differences in the stages of deglutition were analyzed with the pairedsamples t-test. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the differences between groups and the significance of the interaction between stages and groups. p &#8804; 0.05 was considered significant.Descriptive statistics of the measurements are presented in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. In this table, mean values and standard deviations of the measurements according to the stages are shown for both OBG and CG.</p>

            <p>1-3 uL of samples loaded in home-made gold-coated borosilicate capillaries were directly infused into an Exactive Plus Orbitrap instrument with extended mass range (EMR) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) using an m/z range of 500-10,000 Th. The voltage offsets on transport multi-poles and ion lenses were manually tuned to achieve optimal transmission of protein ions at elevated m/z. Nitrogen was infused in the higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) cell at a gas pressure of 6-8 &#163; 10 &#161;10 bar. MS parameters were adjusted as follows: spray voltage 1.2-1.3 V; source fragmentation 30 V; source temperature 250 C; collision energy 30 V; resolution (at m/z 200) 17,500. The instrument was mass-calibrated using CsI clusters, as described previously. <ref type="bibr">33</ref> The raw mass spectra were deconvoluted using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="d25fd4333c-software-0">Protein Deconvolution</rs> v<rs corresp="#d25fd4333c-software-0" resp="#annotator2" type="version">2.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#d25fd4333c-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Thermo Fisher Scientific</rs>, Germany) and<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="d25fd4333c-software-1">BioAnalyst</rs> v<rs corresp="#d25fd4333c-software-1" resp="#annotator2" type="version">1.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#d25fd4333c-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">AB/Sciex</rs>, Canada).

            <p>Differences in age between healthy controls and patients were examined using twotailed Student's t test, and the 2 test was used to examine differences in gender distribution. For the case-control association study, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) testing of the SNPs was done using SNPAlyze V7.0 Pro (Dynacom, Chiba, Japan). The HWE tests were carried out for all loci in patients and controls. Differences in genotypic and allelic frequencies were evaluated based on the case-control design using 2 analysis. Linkage disequilibrium (LD), denoted as D ', was calculated from the haplotype frequency using the expectation-maximization algorithm. The LD block was also identified using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="a93bdc2ade-software-simple-0">SNPAlyse</rs> software when D ' was greater than 0.75. Case-control haplotype analysis was also performed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="a93bdc2ade-software-simple-1">SNPAlyse</rs> software. Permutation analysis was used to determine the empirical significance and to calculate the p values based on 10,000 replications. The global p values represent the overall significance using the 2 test when the observed versus expected frequencies of all haplotypes are considered together. Individual haplotypes were tested for association by grouping all other haplotypes together and applying the 2 test with 1 d.f. All p values reported are two-tailed. Statistical significance was defined at p ! 0.05.</p>
            <p>To analyze interactions between SNPs in PGBD1 and APOE genotypes, logistic regression analysis was performed using HealthSketch version 2.5 (Dynacom). The probability (P c ) of an individual being a case rather than a control is assumed to be affected by a set of SNPs, according to the logistic model. For example, logit(P) = b 0 + b 1 x 1 + b 2 x 2 for a single SNP. Here, we use a coding scheme x 1 = -1, 0, 1 and x 2 = -0.5, 0.5, -0.5 for genotypes homozygous for major alleles, heterozygous, and homozygous for minor alleles (for APOE , 4 was assumed to be the minor allele, and 2 and 3 were assumed to be major alleles simultaneously), respectively, to represent an additive effect with x 1 and a dominant/recessive effect with x 2 . The weights were estimated with the maximum likelihood method and tested by comparison with the null hypothesis logit(P c ) = b 0 (constant). We performed a stepwise forward selection procedure with two purposes: the first was to test the relationships among multiple SNPs in PGBD1 and the APOE genotype, and the second was to confirm the interaction among the SNPs if a significant association with p ! 0.05 was shown with individual logistic models. Multiple regression analyses were performed to estimate the relationship among the age of onset, APOE status, and the 4 SNPs using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a93bdc2ade-software-2">SPSS</rs> software ver. <rs corresp="#a93bdc2ade-software-2" resp="#annotator10" type="version">17.0</rs> for Windows (<rs corresp="#a93bdc2ade-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">IBM</rs>, Chicago, Ill., USA).</p>

            <p>We used data from the National Prescribing Service (NPS) MedicineWise (formerly NPS Medicines Line), operated by clinical pharmacists of Mater Health Services, Brisbane, between September 2002 and June 2010. This call centre was available to consumers Australia-wide for medicine-related questions. Since data from our observational study were originally routinely collected as part of a health service without specific a priori research goals, research was conducted and reported in accordance with the REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely-collected health Data (RECORD) guideline, <ref type="bibr">17</ref> an extension of the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Details of each call were captured on a standardised form and entered into a <rs corresp="#adf2a3dbf5-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Microsoft</rs> <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="adf2a3dbf5-software-0">Access</rs> database. These included demographics, enquiry type, relationship of caller to patient and motivation for calling. For each call, up to three generic medicines relating to the question were recorded and categorised by the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system of medicines. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Of the five ATC levels, we examined medicine classes at the ATC3 level, which labels medicines according to their pharmacological subgroup (eg, antihistamines-systemic), as well as at the ATC5 level, which identifies the chemical substance (eg, chlorpheniramine). Caller location was identified by postal code and grouped by state/territory and Accessibility/ Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA), a measure of the remoteness of areas from service centres. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> The relative population ratio was determined by dividing percentage of paracetamol calls from each ARIA category by percentage of population living in each ARIA category. Narrative for calls between January 2009 and June 2010 were also recorded electronically. Calls involving paracetamol in the question were extracted for analysis. Remaining calls were classified as 'rest of calls'. We excluded calls that only involved a voicemail request for Consumer Medicines Information (CMI) leaflets.</p>
            <p>We conducted a retrospective quantitative analysis on all paracetamol-related calls. Comparisons between paracetamol and 'rest of calls' were performed using a &#967; 2 test for categorical data. Each call was originally coded for 1 of 25 enquiry types. These were collapsed into seven question categories: 'efficacy' (indications for use, medicine comparisons, effectiveness for specific conditions or symptoms); 'interaction'; 'other safety' (side effects or cautions for use), 'administration' (dose, administration, formulation or storage issues); safety in 'pregnancy and/or lactation'; 'logistics' (availability or cost) and 'miscellaneous'. Enquiry types were compared by patient age groups and other life stages, for example, during pregnancy or breast feeding. Concurrent medicines included in paracetamol calls were also compared by age groups and a special population, pregnant women. A two-sided p-value &lt;0.05 was considered significant.

            <p>Our interest in this issue comes from the emergence of a hybrid form of governance between intermediation and community building. On the one hand, these platforms define themselves as 'intermediaries', creating an apparent proximity with other online intermediaries such as eBay.com, Craigslist or Facebook, because of a strong technological integration with the Web 2.0 (including social networks and user reviews) <ref type="bibr">(Belk 2014)</ref>. The main difference between intermediaries and merchants is the distribution of control between the platform and the participants <ref type="bibr">(Hagiu 2007)</ref>. While the merchants keep full control over the sale (e.g. pricing, quantities), intermediaries only control the affiliation to their platform, taking the form of a two-sided platform connecting independent sellers and buyers. On the other hand, by putting forward the idea of sharing, these platforms position themselves in a moral system interested in social welfare <ref type="bibr">(Botsman and Rogers 2011)</ref>. Assuming that learning and enforcing morality is the result of both individual attributes and social relations <ref type="bibr">(Hodgson 2014)</ref>, decentralized platforms do not provide the structure for this kind of social enterprise. For instance, we can observe this ambiguity in the governance of Airbnb, in which the platform emphasizes its role of intermediary by describing itself as "a trusted community marketplace" 1 rather than a company or a merchant. Yet, on September 8th 2016, Brian Chesky, CEO and co-founder of Airbnb addressed an email to the entire community of users entitled "Discrimination and Belonging". <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The core of the email consists in the acknowledgment of discrimination on the platform, and the description of new platform policies implementing stronger control over the users' behaviors.</p>
            <p>By focusing on the individual participants rather than the platform, we need to adopt a performance measure that will reflect this perspective (instead of plaform market shares or winner-take-all competition). We do so by adopting the concept of "allocative efficiency" <ref type="bibr">(Gode and Sunder 1993, 1997)</ref>. In its most generic form, "allocative efficiency is the ratio of the actual to the potential gains from trade" <ref type="bibr">(Gode and Sunder 1997: 603)</ref>. The upper bound of the "potential gains" is reached when the participants can make all the transactions they desire, either as suppliers when they share their possessions, or as customers by accessing the shared goods. Concretely, on the demand side, Airbnb is functioning efficiently if the guests find a room when they desire to travel or BlaBlacar is efficient when there is a seat available for one's desired journey. On the supply side, both the revenue and the efficient utilization of our shareable possessions are impacted if an Airbnb host or a BlaBlaCar traveler cannot find a buyer. From the public good perspective, such a failure can be seen as proof that profit-based platforms cannot provide the basic level of service required by Universal Service obligations <ref type="bibr">(Slee 2016)</ref> or provided by incumbent firms <ref type="bibr">(Cusumano 2015)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Our model captures the operation of a peer-to-peer marketplace guided by decentralized decision-making and user reviews. Our objective is to compare the performance of different motivations when the peers try to complete transactions. We present our model as an online platform for accommodations (such as Airbnb): the customers are 'guests' who want to find a 'host' for a night at a given location. Below, we describe the model in three blocks / sub-sections:</p>
            <p>In more detail, we learned from the literature on user reviews that reviews contribute to reputation building and are being used as a proxy rather than a fair source of information. For instance, Fradkin (2014) analyzed search data from Airbnb and shows that potential customers filter the listings based on objective variables (mostly the location and maximum price) before browsing the remaining listings and evaluating more subjective characteristics (including the number and text of reviews). Such a distinction can be found in the model of an online market with a self-selection bias of user reviews built by <ref type="bibr">Li and Hitt (2008)</ref>. In their model, they distinguish two classes of attributes: the 'search attributes', which can be inspected before the transaction, and the 'experience attributes', which are specific to each customer based on its experience of the product.</p>
            <p>&amp; Price Strategy: <ref type="bibr">Zervas et al. (2017)</ref> point up how Airbnb has affected a specific segment of the hospitality industry, the lower-end hotels. Hotels offering business services do not suffer from the emergence of this platform. <ref type="bibr">Guttentag (2015)</ref> observes that Airbnb is attractive to the low end of the market and covers a demand that is unattractive for the incumbents of the hospitality industry. Airbnb provides accommodations cheaper than hotels. Our understanding is that saving money is a strong motivation on these platforms:</p>
            <p>From the participant perspective, our results echo the work of <ref type="bibr">Lauermann et al. (2017)</ref> showing that decentralized mechanisms can achieve allocation efficiency even when the participants ignore the exact market condition (including their own characteristics), provided that the search frictions are small. To diminish the search friction, the platform should use all the governance mechanisms (monetary, nonmonetary and informational) at its disposal <ref type="bibr">(Boudreau and Hagiu 2009; Phelps et al. 2008)</ref>. For instance, <ref type="bibr">Gode and Sunder (1997)</ref> face a similar problem when their double auction system cannot prevent the allocative inefficiency resulting from the displacement of intramarginal traders by extramarginal traders (who do not value the goods as much as the intramarginal traders). As a solution, they sketch an alternative market governance that almost mimics the mechanism of centralized assortative matching (e.g., bids and asks closer to actual constraints, delayed decisions queuing in a clearing house). In the same line, <ref type="bibr">Anderson and Renault (1999)</ref> use search costs to explain the emergence of "tourist traps", i.e., options with similar characteristics and largely overpriced, because "buyers do not shop around". Different mechanisms can be tested to achieve such results. In addition to the non-monetary instruments proposed above and following the lessons from the two-sided market literature, the platform can regulate the behaviors monetarily by subsidizing the underactive participants using fees collected from their overpriced counterpart. The platform can also modify how the information is displayed, for instance, to alter the tolerance and the price range of the participants. In fact, Airbnb uses such a mechanism in the search ranking of accommodations. 6</p>

            <p>The changes in HbA 1c from baseline to week 24 were assessed using ANCOVA, with treatment, study, and washout as fixed classification effects and baseline HbA 1c as a covariate. The same model with the addition of the covariate baseline FPG was used to assess changes in FPG from baseline to week 24. The reductions in HbA 1c within the linagliptin group were stratified into quartiles based on the change from baseline to week 24: ,0.1, 0.120.59, 0.6020.99, and $1.0% (,1.1, 1.126.5, 6.6210.8, and $10.9 mmol/mol). Effects on SBP after treatment within the linagliptin group were stratified into three categories based on the change from baseline to the last value on treatment: SBP decrease of .1.0 mmHg, stable SBP with only minimal changes between 21.0 and 11.0 mmHg, and SBP increase of .1.0 mmHg. The difference between percentage changes in geometric mean UACR across HbA 1c quartiles and SBP categories was tested using an ANOVA F-test to determine whether they were statistically significantly different. Safety assessments were performed on the pooled treated set.

            <p>Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure were measured with a noninvasive tail-cuff system (Softron BP-98A; Softron, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>. Hemodynamic measurement. Rats under deep anesthesia underwent hemodynamic measurement. A fluid-filled catheter was advanced from the right carotid artery into the LV, and the left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was measured. Histology and morphometric analysis. Paraformaldehyde (4%)-fixed hearts were bisected transversely at the midventricular level, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 4-mm sections. A single myocyte was measured with images captured from hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. The myocyte crosssectional area was assessed under 3400 magnification within the LV, and a mean was obtained by quantitative morphometry with automated image analysis (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator28" type="software" xml:id="ac88aac71e-software-2">Image-Pro Plus</rs>, Version <rs corresp="#ac88aac71e-software-2" resp="#annotator28" type="version">5.0</rs>; <rs corresp="#ac88aac71e-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Media Cybernatics</rs>, Houston, TX).</p>
            <p>Dark green-stained collagen fibers were quantified as a measure of fibrosis in Masson trichrome-stained sections. The collagen volume fraction (CVF) and perivascular collagen area/luminal area (PVCA/LA) were analyzed by quantitative morphometry with automated image analysis (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator28" type="software" xml:id="ac88aac71e-software-3">Image-Pro Plus</rs>, Version <rs corresp="#ac88aac71e-software-3" resp="#annotator28" type="version">5.0</rs>). CVF was calculated as reported previously <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref>. Perivascular collagen was excluded from the CVF measurement. To normalize the PVCA around vessels with different sizes, the perivascular collagen content was represented as the PVCA-to-LA ratio.</p>
            <p>Myocardial frozen sections (5 mm) were stained with Oil Red O (Sigma) for 10 min, washed, and then counterstained with hematoxylin for 30 s. A Nikon microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY) was used to capture the Oil Red O-stained tissue sections. Hydroxyproline analysis. The collagen content of myocardial tissue was determined by hydroxyproline assay <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref>. Tissue hydrolysate was detected by use of an ELISA kit (F15649; Westang Bio-Tech, Shanghai, China). Data were expressed as micrograms collagen per milligram dry weight, with the assumption that collagen contains an average of 13.5% hydroxyproline <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref>. Immunohistochemical staining. Paraffin sections underwent immunohistochemistry by a microwave-based antigen retrieval method. The sections were incubated with primary rabbit polyclonal anti-collagen I, anti-collagen III, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, and anti-interleukin (IL)-6 antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) overnight and then with a matching biotinylated secondary antibody for 30 min at 37&#176;C. Negative controls were omission of the primary antibody. The stained sections were developed with diaminobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin. The results were viewed under a confocal FV 1000 SPD laser scanning microscope (Olympus, Japan). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Total RNA was prepared with the TRIzol reagent (Gibco/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RT-PCR was performed using the following primers: b-actin, forward 59-AGA CCT TCA ACA CCC CAG-39 and reverse 59-CAC GAT TTC CCT CTC AGC-39; brain natriuretic protein, forward 59-GGG CTG TGA CGG GCT GAG GTT-39 and reverse 59-AGT TTG TGC TGG AAG ATA AGA3-9; TRB3, forward 59-TGA TGC TGT CTG GAT GAC AA-39 and reverse 59-GTG AAT GGG GAC TTT GGT CT-39; TNF-a, forward 59-CAC GCT CTT CTG TCT ACT GA-39 and reverse 59-GGA CTC CGT GAT GTC TAA GT-39; and IL-6, forward 59-ACC ACT TCA CAA GTC GGA GG-39 and reverse 592ACA GTG CAT CAT CGC TGT TC-39. Reactions were carried out on a real-time PCR thermocycler (IQ5 Real-Time PCR cycler; Bio-Rad), using SYBR green as fluorescence dye. Relative expression analysis involved the 2 2 &#9651;&#9651;CT method. Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was as described previously <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>. We used antibodies against TRB3 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), collagen I, collagen III, TNF-a, IL-6 (Abcam), phospho (p)-extracellular signal-regulated, followed by anti-IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. TRB3, collagen I, collagen III, TNF-a, and IL-6 protein levels were normalized to that of b-actin as an internal control and phosphospecific proteins to that of total protein. Gene silencing of TRB3. Sixty rats were randomized to receive TRB3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) or vehicle treatment. Gene silencing occurred immediately after the appearance of LV diastolic dysfunction. After 12 weeks of diabetes, both E/A and E9/A9 were ,1.0 as assessed by echocardiography in diabetic rats. Animals were then injected via the jugular vein with 2.5 3 10 10 plaque-forming units of an adenovirus harboring TRB3 gene (TRB3-siRNA) or a control empty virus (vehicle). Adenovirus transfer was repeated in 2 weeks. According to our present and previous studies (23), TRB3 level was increased in HF diet-fed and high fructose-fed rats. Previous studies have shown that insulin resistance was a hallmark of obesity <ref type="bibr">(24)</ref> and metabolic syndrome <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref>. In light of the interaction between TRB3 and insulin resistance, we also investigated the effect of TRB3-siRNA on HF diet-induced cardiac injury. Four weeks after the first adenovirus injection, rats were killed. The heart was excised and weighed. Statistical analysis. Values are presented as mean 6 SEM. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator28" type="software" xml:id="ac88aac71e-software-4">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#ac88aac71e-software-4" resp="#annotator28" type="version">16.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#ac88aac71e-software-4" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SPSS</rs>, Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analysis.

            <p>The lack of methods for tracking cells in 3D has been reported as a limiting factor, for instance in the context of immunoimaging <ref type="bibr">(Cahalan and Parker, 2008)</ref>. Despite the well-established protocol to capture microglia, innate immune cells in the central nervous system, in 3D using two-photon microscopy following the seminal works by <ref type="bibr">Nimmerjahn et al. (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Davalos et al. (2005)</ref>, motility analysis has been performed by (and limited to) manual estimations derived from 2D projections <ref type="bibr">(Davalos et al., 2008)</ref> in the numerous studies following these protocols. In fact, tracking microglia cells is complicated by several aspects. Microglia tightly contact specific brain structures in their resting state <ref type="bibr">(Wake et al., 2009)</ref>, often making it difficult to clearly separate them from their surroundingWhile the red cell remains in resting state, the green cell is activated through an induced injury and migrates along a trajectory (orange line, trajectory obtained by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-0">ct3d</rs>; blue line, trajectory obtained from manual annotation) toward a site of injury (purple dot); see Supplementary Video 1 for a rendered animation of the same data.</p>
            <p>We implemented our algorithm in the publicly available <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-1">ct3d</rs> software package, which is accompanied by the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-2">at3d</rs> graphical user interface. In terms of applying our algorithm, this article focuses on evaluating the performance of our cosegmentation-based approach for 3D cell tracking, leaving colocalization studies as a future direction. Cell tracking performance is evaluated both on two-photon live cell imaging data displaying zebrafish microglia in vivo, and on synthetically generated data that allow to determine the algorithm's accuracy based on the ground truth the synthetic data were generated from.</p>
            <p>Filtering results: as for most segmentation and tracking approaches, the results obtained from the steps described above has a tendency toward overdetection, i.e. detecting segments that result from image noise rather than cells. To filter out those segments, we utilize life span filtering, i.e. we filter out all cells whose identity can be traced across less than a certain minimum number of frames. This cell filter, along with several other ways to eliminate cells with unsuitable size or volume features, follows corresponding features of the <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator23" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-3">Celltrack</rs> software <ref type="bibr">(Sacan et al., 2008)</ref> for 2D cell tracking; for<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-4">ct3d</rs>, they are implemented in the graphical user interface of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-5">at3d</rs> tool shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.</p>
            <p>&#8226; Alternative matching schemes: one class of cell tracking approaches is based on computing bipartite matchings between segmentations of individual time frames. As bipartite matchings may not capture events such as cell division or cell fusion, recent works such as <ref type="bibr">Padfield et al. (2009)</ref> introduced alternative matching schemes that are more flexible. Truly generalizing bipartite matchings, tree assignments can be seen as such alternative matching scheme. They are particularly interesting for cell tracking, as they may capture events such as cell division, cell fusion or cells entering the scene. See Supplementary Video 4 for synthetic data displaying a simplistic simulation of a cell division tracked by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-6">ct3d</rs>.</p>
            <p>We implemented component trees, tree-assignments and the complete cell tracking algorithm, in C++ using <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator23" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-3">lp_solve</rs> <rs corresp="#b27b28bf20-software-3" resp="#curator" type="version">1</rs> for solving both the tree assignment and the weighted bipartite matching (integer) linear programs, all of which is compiled in the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-9">ct3d</rs> command line tool. Cell tracking results can be further explored using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-10">at3d</rs>, which allows the user to select and extract specific cells identified by the cell tracking procedure, and derive their motility parameters such as velocity and deformation. The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-11">at3d</rs> tool is implemented using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-12">qt</rs> framework for graphical user interfaces. Input and output of image series is designed to be compatible with other visualization software, most notably <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-13">v3d</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Peng et al., 2010)</ref> for producing rendered visualizations of the output.</p>
            <p>We evaluated our algorithm on two types of data. First, we applied it to an in vivo time-lapse sequence of 3D two-photon images of zebrafish midbrain, displaying the motility of microglia; second, we applied <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-14">ct3d</rs> to synthetically generated data for quantifying the accuracy of our cell tracking results.</p>
            <p>Evalutation on in vivo data was accomplished by comparison with manually annotated trajectories of specific microglia in three datasets. Note that manual annotation is limited to trajectories, whereas boundaries of the cell volumes are almost impossible to obtain in 3D, beside systematic problems with manual annotations <ref type="bibr">(Huth et al., 2010)</ref>. Hence, we additionally created synthetic ground truth data to further evaluate the performance of our method. We followed the procedure used in <ref type="bibr">Dufour et al. (2005)</ref>, generating (noise perturbed) elliptical objects of average intensity I o above Poisson distributed background noise of intensity I b . In addition to the procedure from <ref type="bibr">Dufour et al. (2005)</ref>, we created perturbed images with different types of background inhomogeneities, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>: in a second set of data, we introduced a multiplicative vignetting effect to the data, following the vignetting model by <ref type="bibr">Kang and Weiss (2000)</ref> under different focal lengths f and off-axis illumination parameters &#945;. In a third set of data, we introduced an additive linear gradient along the x-axis of different slopes &#946;. Each time series consists of 20 time frames, each of size 200&#215;200&#215;40 pixels. On these data, we ran <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-15">ct3d</rs> with size cutoffs &#952; min = 500 and &#952; max = 5000, and a single-node cutoff of 200 pixels. In the resulting sequences, all cells whose identity could be traced through the complete sequence were kept, while all other cells were discarded using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-16">at3d</rs> tool.</p>
            <p>Our results on the synthetically generated image sequences are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> and indicate that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-17">ct3d</rs> is highly robust against different types and intensities of background inhomogeneities. The results suggest that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-18">ct3d</rs> has a tendency to identify components slightly (about 10%) larger than the actual objects, as can also be seen in the sample output in Supplementary Video 3. This is a natural consequence of pruning the component trees, where the vertex that would perfectly represent an object is unlikely to be part of the pruned tree. This effect can be reduced by smaller choice for the single-node cutoff parameter &#963; at the cost of higher computation time.</p>
            <p>Running times varied between roughly 4 and 6 min, with an average of 303.42 s, for completely tracking one dataset. The <ref type="bibr">(Kang and Weiss, 2000)</ref>. The dashed box indicates the position of the 1D section displayed in the lower part. Right: same setting with the background perturbed by an additive linear gradient. In both instances, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-19">ct3d</rs> yields reliable tracking results (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). majority of running time was spent on constructing the component trees and computing the overlap weights (14.23 s on average per time frame), whereas each tree assignment required less than one second on average; the pruned component trees typically comprised a few dozens of vertices.</p>
            <p>As a reference algorithm to compare against the performance of<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-20">ct3d</rs>, we computed a segmentation of each time frame using the active contour approach by <ref type="bibr">Chan and Vese (2001)</ref>, 2 which is a wellestablished and state-of-the-art representative of the large family of level set methods. As shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, this method works highly accurate in the absence of background inhomogeneity while getting less reliable with increasing levels of background inhomogeneity, as can be expected due to the involvement of a global background model. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows a result obtained from our tracking algorithm on a time series of microglia images measured as described above. We reduced resolution by half, so that the resulting width and height varied between 146 and 250 pixels, while the depth ranged between 14 and 66 layers for each time frame; each time series comprised 30-80 time frames. Gray scale resolution was reduced from 16 bit to 8 bit. We applied <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-21">ct3d</rs> using parameters &#952; min = 200, &#952; max = 10 000 and a single-node cutoff of 200 pixels; the resulting pruned component trees contained 69 vertices on average, ranging between 40 and 168 vertices. Running times varied between roughly 2 and 10 min, with 471 s on average.</p>
            <p>Under the given experimental protocol, the phenomenon of overdetection, i.e. the recognition of segments that are not microglia, is inevitable. This is due to the limited specificity of the apoE-GFP gene, which is also expressed in cells other than microglia in the surrounding tissue, often at comparably high levels as in microglia. Yet, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-22">ct3d</rs> identifies microglia as segments that can be visually distinguished from non-microglia segments by a human observer due to their characteristic shape or motion patterns. The <rs cert="0.9" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-23">Ct3d</rs> graphical user interface of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-24">at3d</rs> tool (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>) allows to manually eliminate false positive cells from tracking results by different filtering and visual selection functions similar to those provided by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-25">Celltrack</rs> for 2D time-lapse sequences. The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-26">at3d</rs> tool also allows to manually correct for the occasionally observed events of oversegmentation, i.e. one microglia being recognized as two segments. We used <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-27">at3d</rs> to eliminate non-microglia from all six datasets and correct oversegmentation in individual frames. We were able to reconstruct trajectories of all relevant microglia that can be visually identified in the original datasets; only one dataset was affected by a sudden 'frameshift', i.e. the sample changing its distance to the camera in the z direction, leading to interrupted trajectories at the corresponding time frame. In few other cases, the trajectory of a microglia was interrupted in individual frames, which we could correct using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-28">at3d</rs>. Examples of the final results are given in Supplementary Videos 1 and 2.</p>
            <p>In order to quantitatively evaluate the quality of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-29">ct3d</rs> results on in vivo microglia data, we compared <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator23" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-30">ct3d</rs> trajectories with manual annotations. To this end, we selected four microglia from four different datasets and annotated their trajectories manually using the 3D polyline markup feature of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-31">v3d</rs> software. The root mean square distance between the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-32">ct3d</rs> and the manual trajectories turned out to be 2.9 voxels, 5.5 voxels, 2.6 voxels and 5.4 voxels, respectively, in the four different datasets. These deviations can be considered relatively small in relation to the cell diameters, which were measured as 22.8, 22, 19.6 and 44.3 voxels, respectively.</p>
            <p>We have presented a novel approach to tracking cells in 3D time-lapse microscopy image sequences, based on the concepts of component trees and cosegmentation. We demonstrate that this approach is robust against the numerous challenges imposed by images measured in an in vivo environment, and allows to identify microglia and their motion patterns in zebrafish neural tissue when combined with the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-33">at3d</rs> annotation tool. In a quantitative evaluation, we show that our approach is robust against different types of background inhomogeneities. This suggests that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-34">ct3d</rs> and<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-35">at3d</rs> are potentially useful for in vivo imaging studies investigating other aspects than just microglia motility. In its current formulation, our cosegmentation approach relies on the assumption that the area occupied by an object overlaps between two consecutive time points. While this may not be satisfied in all cell tracking problems [e.g. when tracking centrosomes <ref type="bibr">(Jaensch et al., 2010)</ref>], it is a reasonable assumption for many immunoimaging-related studies.</p>
            <p>To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that can identify and track microglia in live cell imaging time series. In most cases, obtaining reliable trajectories still requires manual post-processing of the output. The most notorious difficulties certainly are the complex morphology-their deformation patterns, irregular shapes and interaction with the surrounding-as well as the unspecificity of the fluorescent markers available. In this light, our approach constitutes significant progress in the sense that it has sufficient sensitivity to separate microglia form their surrounding. Yet, a fully automated approach remains a major and certainly non-trivial challenge. A first step in this direction might be the combination with level-set based approaches as utilized for 2D cellBottom: quantitative comparison of trajectories obtained by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-36">ct3d</rs> and the active contour approach from <ref type="bibr">Chan and Vese (2001)</ref>. In general, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-37">ct3d</rs> could identify the annotated cells in all time frames (columns # Frames). The root mean square distance to the annotated trajectory measures a fraction of the diameter of the annotated cell (columns cell and RMS), while the Chan-Vese algorithm missed varying numbers of cells or failed completely (last column). For the Chan-Vese results, a parameter set was optimized for dataset (a). This parameter set (&#181; = 1, &#957; = .5, &#955; 1 = .2, &#955; 2 = 5) was also applied to datasets (b) to (d). While for dataset (a), the result is comparable to <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator23" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-38">ct3d</rs>, the annotated cell was identified in only 29 out of 49 time frames in (b). In datasets (c) and (d), the annotated cell could not be identified at all using these parameters. See Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure</ref> tracking by <ref type="bibr">Nath et al. (2006)</ref> that might yield more accurate cell boundaries in some cases. Yet, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-39">ct3d</rs> promises to be a key tool for further studying open questions regarding microglia, such as to determine if and how glia and microglia share the task of finding and removing apoptotic neurons from the vertebrate brain <ref type="bibr">(Peri and N&#252;sslein-Volhard, 2008)</ref>.</p>

Prior to artifact removal, EEG epochs were extracted from the continuous EEG from 1000 ms before, to 2000 ms after onset of the CWs. Single word epochs with artifacts that occurred between 200 ms before to 800 ms after stimulus onset were removed from analysis. A Z -score based algorithm was used to detect eye blinks and eye movements, and other artifacts were detected with a threshold algorithm. After removal, about 70% of single word epochs remained. There were an average (marginal means) of 436 single word epochs in the sentence condition, 462 in the scrambled sentence condition, 480 in the OC condition, and 417 in the CC condition.

            <p>Finally, nobody appears to have made software code available. The conclusion must be that J-tests have rarely been used in empirical research up to now and that the main bottleneck for practitioners is the lack of freely downloadable software. Hence, besides further developing J-tests, and stating that J-tests are a useful tool to select the right spatial weights matrix and/or spatial econometric model specification, we suggest that the researchers who have been active in this field may have even more impact if they make their software available. This would follow LeSage <ref type="formula">(2015)</ref>, who has made available code written in <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="e99746b1fa-software-simple-0">Matlab</rs> relating to his Bayesian comparison approach.</p>

            <p>Regarding the first type of methods employed to detect subcomplexes in AP data, there are many available clustering algorithms that could be applied to the networks resulting from the scoring step. Most have been proposed following the assumption that complexes can be reconstructed from highly densely connected regions in the network <ref type="bibr">13</ref>: RNSC and MCL are some important examples <ref type="bibr">14</ref>. A review of twelve of these algorithms <ref type="bibr">15</ref> claim that the best prediction method is ''Infomap'', followed by ''Fast modularity'', and ''Potts model approach''. However, it has also been argued that densely connected regions do not reflect functional units; hence, alternative ways to look at the complex prediction problem have been proposed <ref type="bibr">13,16,17</ref>. In addition, complex prediction algorithms have also evolved from algorithms that generate non-intersecting or non-overlapping clusters to algorithms that take into account the fact that protein complexes share subunits with other complexes, i.e., overlapping community detection algorithms. Some of these methods are <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-0">MCODE</rs> <ref type="bibr">18</ref>, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-1">CFinder</rs> <ref type="bibr">19</ref>, Link-communities <ref type="bibr">10,20</ref>, OCG 11 , <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-2">Cluster-ONE</rs> <ref type="bibr">21</ref> and RSRGM <ref type="bibr">17</ref>. Regarding the second type of methods that allow subcomplex detection, an early strategy to take into account the overlapping nature of complexes and apply it to complex identification from AP experiments was introduced by Gavin et al. <ref type="bibr">6</ref>, who, after applying the SA score to AP data, performed repeated hierarchical clustering using different parameters to generate overlapping complexes that they described as composed of common ''cores'' and ''attachments''. Two recent papers, <ref type="bibr">22</ref> and 23 , present a review of current clustering methods applied to protein complex identification. A group of methods, including CORE <ref type="bibr">24</ref>, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-3">COACH</rs> <ref type="bibr">25</ref> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-4">CACHET</rs> <ref type="bibr">26</ref>, deserve a special mention for explicitly incorporating the above-mentioned ''coreattachment'' model (other methods include: Markov random fields <ref type="bibr">27</ref> and CODEC <ref type="bibr">28</ref>). In this paper, we will explore the detection of biologically relevant subcomplexes from AP data through some of the above-mentioned techniques, and suggest a new strategy which might be able to improve them. We will evaluate the use of some recent methods that are able to detect ''nested communities'' or ''hierarchies'', in order to prove whether or not these nested communities can detect biologically meaningful subcomplexes, while we introduce a new method to identify subcomplexes from AP data. We start from the premise that most of the previous procedures remove the multi-edge nature of pull-down data in an interaction network (i.e., bait-prey co-occurrences), which is the network signature of a subcomplex. For example, some scoring methods reduce all co-appearances of a bait and a prey protein to one single weighted interaction, whereas some clustering methods explicitly remove any subcomplex candidates. An example of this is the Leu4-Leu9 interaction from Gavin's dataset <ref type="bibr">6</ref> : This interaction does not end up in any complexes when using the PE score, whilst the SA scores produce three complexes and the Dice score produces 2 complexes containing Leu4, Leu9 and a few more subunits. A Leu4-Leu9 complex does not appear in the results with any scoring method and, in fact, Leu4 and Leu9 are the subunits of the alpha-isopropylmalate synthase. This demonstrates how a highly scored copurification, which happens to be a complex, may get filtered out by the clustering method. Here we introduce TRIBAL (TRIad-Based ALgorithm), a novel method to identify subcomplexes from AP data that preserves and exploits this co-occurrence information.</p>
            <p>Complex and subcomplex predictions. Protein complex predictions using each combination of scoring and overlapping clustering methods were performed. First, we scored Gavin's raw data using four of the most popular scoring systems: The SA score <ref type="bibr">6</ref>, the Hart score 7 , the PE score 5 and the ''Dice'' score 4 (seeThe four PINs were clustered using two different overlap-detecting clustering methods: ''Link-communities'' <ref type="bibr">10,20</ref> and ''OCG'' <ref type="bibr">11</ref>. A description of the results can be observed in the Supplementary file (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 1)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Subcomplex predictions using the above-mentioned overlapping clustering strategies were generated by extracting all predicted complexes which were contained (meet-min 5 1.0) by at least one other predicted complex. The result was a prediction of 102 subcomplexesSubcomplexes predictions using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-5">CACHET</rs> method were generated by removing all complexes without attachments and then selecting the cores of the remaining complexes, as explained in Methods. The result was 309 subcomplex predictions.</p>
            <p>Other studies use different methods to determine what a match is. For example, Wu et al. <ref type="bibr">26</ref> use a ''geometric index'' (also called NAscore) smaller than 0.2. The results under this alternative method can be found in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. In this case, results partially contradict the previous analysis, and now Link communities has the best performance, with the best F-measure belonging to a combination of Dicescore and Link communities clustering. We hypothesize that the reason of this difference might be the fact that the hypergeometric score is more sensitive to the size of the complexes and OCG is predicting complexes of a size larger than expected, as it can be observed in the Supplementary file (section 4). However, our main interest is not to evaluate the ability to identify complexes but the ability to identify subcomplexes. We begin by verifying that all datasets under study contain subcomplexes: The MIPS dataset (our reference set) includes 16 subcomplexes. Raw data includes 348 groups of proteins contained in others. None of the sets produced by hierarchical clustering display subcomplexes, as these are non-overlapping methods. The predicted sets (Dice-lcomm, PElcomm, SA-lcomm, Dice-OCG, Hart-OCG, PE-OCG, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-6">CACHET</rs> and TRIBAL) display between 7 and 309 subcomplexes.</p>
            <p>In order to evaluate the subcomplex detection abilities of these methods, we performed two different analyses. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> summarizes the precision and recall analysis for predicted subcomplexes when compared to the full MIPS dataset, using a hyper-geometric score as a criterion for a match. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> does the same when using the geometric score. The results show that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-7">CACHET</rs> has the best F-measure in both cases. Despite the fact that TRIBAL has the best precision in both cases, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-8">CACHET</rs> has a far better recall which ultimately leads to a better F-measure.</p>
            <p>For this reason, we use the meet-min index to verify that predicted subcomplexes are not only similar but contained by MIPS complexes. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> depicts the number and percentage of validated predicted subcomplexes for TRIBAL, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-9">CACHET</rs> and six other methods which combine different scoring and clustering systems, using the meetmin index as comparison criterion. The results show that TRIBAL outperforms all other methods for meet-min equal to 1.0. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-10">CACHET</rs> shows a good performance to low meet-min values, but it decreases strongly when meet-min increases.</p>
            <p>We tested and compared the performance of different combinations of scoring methods (Dice, PE, Hart, SA) and overlapping clustering algorithms (Link-communities, OCG), with one method based on the core-attachment model (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-11">CACHET</rs>) and our own method (TRIBAL). All these three types of methods are based on different assumptions; for example, that subcomplexes can be extracted from high-degree (highly connected) regions of the network or, in our case, that co-purification information with different baits is not only useful as a data quality measure but can also include co-complex information in different biological contexts. These assumptions can be partially validated through the performances of the methods. The results show that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-12">CACHET</rs> gives the best results in terms of similarity (geometric or hypergeometric indexes) to the MIPS reference set (this is mainly due to its better recall), while TRIBAL offers the best precision in terms of similarity and the best performance in terms of containment metrics (meet-min index). From the group of overlapping clustering methods, Link-communities shows better results than OCG.</p>
            <p>We have made a thorough analysis of the traditional complex prediction pipeline for AP-MS experiments. Besides problems due to coverage, false positives and inconsistencies regarding mutual pull-down (see Supplementary File), most traditional methods are not able to detect subcomplexes due to decisions made in the scoring and clustering steps. Based on this knowledge, we have identified the best strategies to detect subcomplexes, including the development of TRIBAL, a simple strategy that improves the precision of subcomplex prediction compared to previous methods. These strategies are the initial attempts to specifically address the subcomplex detection problem in co-purification data. This paper suggests that overlapping clustering methods fail to detect subcomplexes from AP data while the core-attachment model used by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-13">CACHET</rs> and similar software seems to be the best option to this date. However, it also suggests that alternatives such as the co-purification matrix introduced by TRIBAL deserve more attention, as they show potential thanks to a high precision, especially when we evaluate the meet-min index, i.e., subcomplexes absolutely contained by larger complexes. Finally, research in subcomplex identification demands the generation of curated gold standards for subcomplexes, which will be an important step to achieve a better validation of predictions.</p>

            <p>Clustering methods. Link-communities is a method that uses communities of edges and not of nodes. OCG hierarchically merges edges into modules, checking the value of a special modularity function Q. Both OCG and Link-communities were performed using the ''<rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-22">linkcomm</rs>'' <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-23">R</rs> package <ref type="bibr">20</ref>.</p>

The 369 complexes generated by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-25">CACHET</rs> from Gavin's dataset, were retrieved from their web page <ref type="bibr">26</ref>. In order to generate subcomplexes, we selected all complexes containing both core and attachments (i.e., we removed all only-core complexes). Subcomplexes were defined as the cores of those core-attachment sets.</p>
            <p>The comparison is done through three strategies: Firstly, through a hypergeometric test, as defined in eq. <ref type="bibr">(5)</ref>. In this test, the population is the total number of proteins, the population success is the size of the MIPS complex, the sample is the predicted complex (predicted either by any combination of the scores and clustering algorithms here employed, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="d1a4446be6-software-simple-26">CACHET</rs> or TRIBAL) and the success sample is the size of the intersection between MIPS and the predicted complex. The overlap is considered significant when p-value , 0.05. Secondly, the geometric index, defined as follows:</p>

            <p>supplemental methods in the online appendix available at http://dx.doi.org/ 10.2337/db07-1751). Whole-blood and plasma measurements. Total white blood cell number and differential counts were assessed by standard techniques (ACP Diagnostic Lab, University of California, San Diego). We measured plasma insulin by radioimmunoassay (Linco Research) and determined free fatty acids by colorimetric assay (Wako). Plasma cytokines were measured by the core laboratories of the Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Consortium (University of California, Los Angeles; LINCOplex assay for Mouse Cytokines, http://www.derc.med.ucla.edu/core.htm). Plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured by enzymatic methods using an automated bichromatic analyzer (Abbot Diagnostics). All of these measurements were performed on 11 wild-type and 9 &#9251;4(Y991A) mice for high-fat diet and 6 wild-type and 5 &#9251;4(Y991A) mice for chow diet <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. Histochemistry. Adipose tissue was fixed overnight in 10% formaldehyde, dehydrated in ethanol bath, and paraffin-embedded. Sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) for observation of adipose tissue structure. Pancreas isolation and determination of islet area. Pancreata were isolated and fixed in 4% formalin overnight. Paraffin sections were generated and stained with H-E. Pictures were taken of H-E-stained pancreas sections, and the area of Langerhans islets and the total area of the pancreas were measured using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="def90e121a-software-0">ImageJ</rs> software (<rs corresp="#def90e121a-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">NIH</rs> freeware). Islet area was depicted as percentage of total pancreas area. Sections of four to seven mice per group and at least six different pancreas areas per mouse were analyzed for statistical significance using unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. P values &#1021;0.05 were considered significant. Bone marrow transplantation. We injected bone marrow obtained from wild-type and &#9251;4(Y991A) mice (4 &#1003; 10 6 cells) through the tail vein into male C57BL/6 (4 months) and &#9251;4(Y991A) (4 -6 months) mice that had been irradiated (10 Gy) 4 h before. Mice were allowed 4 weeks for reconstitution of donor marrow, which we verified by PCR <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>. Isolation of stromal vascular cells. Epidydimal fat pads were minced in PBS and digested with collagenase (Roche) and DNase I (Sigma) for 1 h at 37&#176;C. Suspensions were then filtered through a 100-m nylon cell strainer and then spun at 1,000g for 10 min. The preadipocyte/adipocyte-enriched fraction was removed. Isolated stromal vascular cells were resuspended in red blood cell lysis buffer (10 mmol/l KHCO 3 , 150 mmol/l NH 4 Cl, and 0.1 mmol/l EDTA, pH 8) for 5 min at room temperature. Cell suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 500g, and stromal vascular cells were resuspended in PBS at 10 6 cells/100 l. Flow cytometry. Cells were harvested from WAT, peripheral blood, and bone marrow and incubated in Fc blocker (rat anti-mouse CD16/32) for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-Ly-6G (1/200) and phycoerythrin (PE)-7/4 (1/50) (BD Biosciences/ PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Negative control staining was performed with FITC-rat IgG2a/k and PE-rat IgG2a. Cell staining was analyzed with FACScan flow cytometer using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="def90e121a-software-1">CellQuest</rs> software (<rs corresp="#def90e121a-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">BD Biosciences Systems</rs>). Cell migration assay. Cell migration was assayed in a modified Boyden chamber system using a 24-well transwell plate (8-m pore size; Corning) coated with 5 g/ml VCAM-1 (R&amp;D Systems). Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (R&amp;D Systems) was added in the lower chamber at 1 nmol/l. Cells harvested from wild-type or &#9251;4(Y991A) bone marrow were grown for 5-7 days in the presence of granulocyte macrophage-colonystimulating factor (5 l of 0.1 mg/ml stock solution). Bone marrow-derived macrophages (2 &#1003; 10 4 ) were kept in suspension in 1% serum containing medium for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then added to the top chamber and incubated overnight at 37&#176;C. Filters were fixed and stained with crystal violet, and migrated cells in the lower chamber were enumerated. RNA isolation and RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from WAT using RNeasy Lipid Tissue kit (Qiagen). RT-PCRs were carried out as described in the online appendix <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref>. Statistical analysis. Means and SEs were calculated for all dependent measures. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using the one-or two-tailed Student's t test. Significance was set at P &#1349; 0.05. For <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>B, change scores for the chow diet and high-fat diet data were determined using the total area under the curve (AUC) <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref>.</p>

            <p>To do that, H index of a given interleukin was divided by the number of years since publication for the oldest paper included in the H index. A index is the mean number of citations of the papers included in H index <ref type="bibr">(Jin et al., 2007)</ref>. This indicator was generated simultaneously to H index using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a8b8fbdda4-software-simple-0">WOS</rs> software package.</p>
            <p>All statistical analyses were done using computer software <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="a8b8fbdda4-software-1">Prism</rs> 6 for Windows (version <rs corresp="#a8b8fbdda4-software-1" resp="#annotator0" type="version">6.02</rs>; <rs corresp="#a8b8fbdda4-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">GraphPad Software</rs>, San Diego, CA, USA). One-Way ANOVA was used to detect differences amongst the groups. To account for the non-normal distribution of the data, all data were sorted by rank status prior to ANOVA statistical analysis. Tukey's test was used to compare the means of the ranks among the groups. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Because of this high variation, no statistically significant differences were identified between the 39 interleukins. However, it can still be observed that a higher number of articles were found for interleukins 1-18 than for other interleukins. After an analysis of the found articles, we identified several articles which were not linked to the interleukin assessed in the search. These articles can be considered as false positive results and were consequently excluded for further analyses. A list of selected articles was then constituted for each interleukins and each species (supplementary <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). In some cases, the difference in the number of articles was quite important. For instance, in bovine IL1, from 271 articles, 223 were kept. These differences illustrate the necessity to check articles one by one.</p>

            <p>The dose proportionality for loxapine was examined across the dose groups using the power model (linear regression of log AUC inf vs log dose). A slope of 1.00 would indicate "perfect" dose proportionality (double the dose &#188; double the exposure).

            <p>Forty 3-month-old intact Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Research Unit, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. They were acclimatized at the local vivarium for one week (room temperature, 12-hour light/dark cycle). The rats were housed singly in plastic cages with free access to tap water and standard rat chow (Gold Coin, Port Klang, Malaysia). They were stratified into five groups using random numbers generated by statistical software. Orchidectomy was performed in the orchidectomized, AnTT, and testosterone groups. A shamoperated group underwent similar surgical treatment but their testes were not removed. The baseline group was sacrificed without undergoing any surgical treatment or intervention. The AnTT group received AnTT daily (60 mg/kg body weight, oral gavage) for 8 weeks, while the other groups received an equal volume of the olive oil vehicle. The testosterone group received weekly testosterone enanthate injections (7 mg/kg body weight, intramuscularly) for 8 weeks while the other groups received an equal volume of the peanut oil vehicle. Treatment was initiated a week after orchidectomy. The weight of each rat was monitored weekly using a digital scale (Tanita Model 1,144, Tokyo, Japan) and recorded to the nearest 1 g. At the end of the treatment period, the rats were euthanized using diethyl ether (HmbG Chemicals &#174; , Hamburg, Germany), after which their femoral and tibial bones were harvested. After the soft tissue was removed, the bones were either stored in 10% formalin solution for histomorphometric and &#956;CT evaluation, or at -70&#176;C for study of gene expression. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the animal ethics committee at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (Code FP/FAR/2012/IMA/18-July/445-July-2012-April-2014).Contouring was performed using a semiautomated method to select the trabecular region. Three-dimensional reconstruction and evaluation were performed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f8c57aa0b9-software-1">Scanco</rs> software (<rs corresp="#f8c57aa0b9-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Scanco Medical</rs>) to measure the following bone parameters: trabecular bone volume, trabecular number, trabecular separation, trabecular thickness, structural model index, and connectivity density.</p>
            <p>The region assessed was the secondary spongiosa in the metaphyseal region, which is 3-7 mm from the lowest point of the growth plate and 1 mm from the lateral cortex. Structural parameters were investigated by an automated method using an image analyzer (<rs corresp="#f8c57aa0b9-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">MediaCybernetics</rs> <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f8c57aa0b9-software-2">Image Pro-Plus</rs>, Rockville, MD, USA). Dynamic parameters were investigated using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse 80i, Tokyo, Japan) and measured manually using a Weibel grid. The structural parameters measured included trabecular bone volume, thickness, number, and separation. Dynamic parameters measured included single-labeled surface, double-labeled surface, mineralizing rate, mineral apposition rate, and bone formation rate.</p>
            <p>Distribution of the data was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test and all data were found to be normally distributed. Oneway analysis of variance, with either Tukey's or Dunnett's T3 as the post hoc test, was used to detect significant differences in the variables of interest between the study groups. All data are presented as the mean and standard error of the mean. P-values &#57388;0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

The effect of group on accuracy (P &#188; 0.111; F &#188; 2.241) and reaction time (P &#188; 0.191; F &#188; 1.679) of response was not statistically significant (analyses covarying for age and sex). Only two participants (one participant with autism and one control) performed at or below the level of chance on the sex discrimination task. In case this was indicative of reduced attention to the facial stimuli, all analyses were repeated excluding these two participants to confirm that all statistically significant results reported were robust to the exclusion of the data from these two participants.</p>
            <p>To investigate possible biomarkers of familial risk as compared with autism versus control differences, we examined between-group differences in the fMRI response in autism, sibling and control participants within the specific brain regions identified as being significantly activated in the control group. We therefore defined our regions of interest as the clusters of FWE corrected Po0.05 significant activation within the control group activation maps <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>, and used <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c1522259a0-software-simple-3">MarsBar</rs> <ref type="bibr">34</ref> to extract mean activations for the primary contrast (happy minus neutral and fearful minus neutral) for each subject for each region of interest. For illustration, we plotted these FWE corrected activation maps onto the canonical Montreal Neuroimaging Institute (MNI) 152 template brain image <ref type="bibr">33</ref> using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c1522259a0-software-9">SPM</rs> <rs corresp="#c1522259a0-software-9" resp="#annotator5" type="version">8</rs>, and onto a three-dimensional-rendered template brain image using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="c1522259a0-software-10">MRI- cron</rs> software (<rs corresp="#c1522259a0-software-10" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www.sph.sc.edu/comd/rorden/mricron</rs>/). <ref type="bibr">35</ref> We conducted analyses of variance within <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c1522259a0-software-11">PASW Statistics</rs> <rs corresp="#c1522259a0-software-11" resp="#annotator5" type="version">18</rs> to measure the overall effect of group on the primary contrast activation data (happy minus neutral and fearful minus neutral) for each region of interest. Age and sex were modeled as covariates in all analyses. Similarly, we used analyses of variance to investigate autism versus control, control versus sibling and autism versus sibling differences, again taking age and sex as covariates. We investigated linear trend effects across the three groups using polynomial regression, and where a statistically significant linear effect was found, we examined the quadratic effect to confirm that this was nonsignificant. We plotted the mean activation contrast estimate (expressed in arbitrary units &#177; standard error of the mean) for the three study groups.</p>
            <p>Neural response to faces versus fixation crosses. These findings demonstrate a clear linear progression across autism, sibling and control groups for atypical fMRI activation to happy versus neutral faces. To address the question as to whether the neural basis for this marker is an atypical neural response to happy faces, neutral faces or to both, we used the same brain regions defined by the significant activations within controls to happy versus neutral faces (comprising the 11 clusters listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>) <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> Differences between 'unaffected' siblings and controls with no family history of autism in the neural response to happy versus neutral faces.

            <p>Texture analysis. Textures of the samples were measured via neutron diffraction on the High Pressure Preferred Orientation (HIPPO) <ref type="bibr">27</ref> time-of-flight diffractometer at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Samples with a surface size of 1.5 cm 2 were mounted in a way that the Cu-Nb interfaces were perpendicular to the incoming neutron beam and the rolling direction of the sample was parallel with the notch. Five banks of detector panels set at 2h 5 150u, 120u, 90u, 60u, and 40u, respectively, were used to collect diffraction data, while each bank created a full rotation (with regards to the neutron beam direction) of detection coverage. Each sample was rotated to specific angles of v 5 0u, 67.5u, and 90u to increase the coverage of the pole <ref type="bibr">27</ref>. A 10u resolution of the Rietveld refinement was chosen in order to simultaneously fit all the diffraction patterns to an orientation distribution function (ODF).

            <p>Because the spore solution of each strain presented different colors, at time zero, the initial O.D. values were distinctive to each culture in relation to the control culture. This coloration difference (defined here as "specific color influence factor" for each strain) was calculated as follows:Next, the influence factor specific to each strain was subtracted from all O.D values from 0 to 72 h of each culture, in order to express the real growth of the strains. The analysis of variance (Kruskal-Wallis test, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="a5fe46e9f2-software-2">BioEstat</rs> <rs corresp="#a5fe46e9f2-software-2" resp="#annotator5" type="version">4.0</rs> software) was applied using the data obtained, and confirmed by Dunn post hoc test, which was used to verify the significance of the strain's growth compared to the control and among the strains (5). The experimental results were separated into four classes based on the time taken for growth: I) 0 to 18 h, II) 18 to 36 h, III) 36 to 54 h, and IV) 54 to 72 h. The results were analyzed by triangulation of the statistical data with the differences of O.D. per period.</p>

            <p>Seventy-one samples from 26 DCUs and 36 samples from 15 outlets of the water distribution pipework within the departments (three independent water lines) of the Bernhard Gottlieb University Clinic of Dentistry were included in this evaluation. The DCUs were exclusively supplied with drinking water from the Vienna water supply system. All DCUs are equipped with an integrated disinfection device. The following DCU types are being used in the various departments: Sirona C3 (Sirona Dental Systems, Bensheim, Germany), Kavo 1062C and 1065T, 1066R (KaVo Dental GmbH, Biberach/Ri&#223;, Germany). The setup of the integrated disinfection system shall be described for the type Sirona C3 as representative example. The system consists of a tank being filled with a disinfectant containing hydrogen peroxide and silver ions -Dentosept P (1.41% H 2 O 2 and 25 ppm silver ions) / Dentosept PL (1.41% H 2 O 2 and 17 ppm silver ions) (Metasys Medizintechnik GmbH, Innsbruck; Austria) and Oxygenal 6 (6% H 2 O 2 ) (KaVo Dental GmbH, Biberach/Ri&#223;, Germany) -under control of a level switch. Via a flow limiter with solenoid valve the disinfectant is introduced into the water-filled mixing tank and its fluid is flushed through the lines of the dental unit. Samples of 500 ml (corresponding to the bottle marking) were collected in sterile plastic bottles with screw cap containing sodium thiosulfate (Sterilin &#174; , Caerphilly, United Kingdom). The samples collected from the DCU were taken prior to taking the DCU in operation, after 2 minutes of waterflow lead time. Sampling was always done in the same sequence, starting from the connection end of the handpiece, the ultrasonic scaler and the orifice of the air/water spray. Samples were collected from 10 DCUs at 4 different time points, from 15 DCUs at 2 different time points and from 1 dental chair at one time point. Water samples from the water distribution pipework within the departments were also collected prior to taking the DCU in operation. Samples were taken from 4 pipes at 4 time points, from 9 pipes at 2 time points, and from 2 pipes at one time point.The water samples were tested for aerobic heterotrophic colony-forming units using the pour plate method with amounts of 1 ml and 1 ml of samples at 1:100 dilution. Two different agar media were applied: initially, a yeast extract agar (VWR, Darmstadt, Germany) at 36&#176;C for 48 h &#177; 4 h and 22&#176;C for 72 h &#177; 4 h according to EN ISO 6222 <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>, secondly, the R2A agar (Merck, Darmstadt. Germany) at 35&#176;C for 72 h &#177; 4 h and 120 h &#177; 4 h as well as at 22&#176;C for 120 h &#177; 4 h and 168 h &#177; 4 h according to US-EPA <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. For the detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa a membrane filter method was used. Portions of 100 ml were filtered through filters with a pore size of 0.45 &#181;m and transferred onto Pseudomonas selective agar with supplement (Oxoid, Hampshire, United Kingdom) for an incubation time of 48 h &#177; 4 h at 36&#176;C according to EN ISO 16266 <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. Testing for Legionella spp. was also done by using a membrane filter method. Portions of 10 and 100 ml were filtered though black filters with a pore size of 0.45 &#181;m, which were transferred onto a GVPC-medium (Biomerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Additionally, two portions of 0.5 ml were plated on selective and non-selective Legionella agar. All plates were incubated at 36&#176;C for at least 168 h &#177; 4 h according to EN ISO 11731-2 <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. Differentiation of Legionella pneumophila serogroup (Sg) 1, Sg 2-15 and non-pneumophila Legionella was done using test sera (Oxoid, Hampshire, United Kingdom). Isolates of Sg 1 were further subdivided into nine subtypes by application of monoclonal antibodies (MAb) using the "Dresden Panel" <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. Molecular typing of L. pneumophila was performed using the consensus sequence-based scheme (SBT) described by Gaia et al. <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref> and the EWGLI (European Working Group for Legionella Infections) SBT database (version 3.0) <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. Isolates of non-pneumophila Legionella spp. were identified using a sequence-based classification scheme targeting the mip gene <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. The data were evaluated in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="c5b8ebac1b-software-0">SPSS</rs> -Version <rs corresp="#c5b8ebac1b-software-0" resp="#annotator7" type="version">16.0</rs> -(<rs corresp="#c5b8ebac1b-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SPSS Inc</rs>., Chicago, USA). Apart from frequency calculations (minimum, maximum, median and interquartile range), correlation according to Pearson were tested. For all statistical analyses, p-values &lt;0.05 were considered as significant.</p>

            <p>Web-based forms for EDC such as those developed by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-0">REDCap</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Harris et al., 2009)</ref> are extremely useful for either clinician-or self-assessment, allowing the subjects to answer the questions on their own time in the comfort of their own home over the internet, and the answers can be collated without the introduction of an extra transcription step. However, self-assessment may not be an option in some situations. In the case of psychiatric assessments, Frontiers in Neuroinformatics www.frontiersin.org the clinician researcher often must be the person either summarizing or making their best judgment about the subject's response in order to complete an assessment, as in conducting the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis <ref type="bibr">(Spitzer et al., 1992)</ref> or reporting the level of consciousness in a neurological assessment of a nearcomatose patient, for example. Interviewers cannot maintain eye contact or a comfortable interaction when there is a computer monitor between them, which is problematic in various studies; having the clinician turn away to type into a web browser may be disruptive to assessing body language cues or the flow of the interview. Electronic data capture methods for research that occurs in a medical institution to integrate health records with research records <ref type="bibr">(El Fadly et al., 2011)</ref> can depend on internet access during data collection and integration. EDC methods are also needed for studies that need to be performed at locations without internet access, remote rural areas, prisons, or mental health facilities that do not provide computing resources and may even block internet access. These problems make traditional web and desktop software impractical for many studies, which in turn keeps these more distributed clinical studies tethered to paper forms. <rs corresp="#f75beef9fa-software-6" resp="#curator" type="publisher">REDCap</rs> is one of the few to address this, with a "<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-6">REDCap Mobile</rs>" version which allows researchers in these situations to have encrypted laptops with a push-pull relationship to the centralized <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-3">REDCap</rs> database to allow data collection while off-line <ref type="bibr">(Borlawsky et al., 2011)</ref>.</p>
            <p>A list of current EDC packages are listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, with their published characteristics. Current web-based EDC solutions suffer from two primary disadvantages, as can be seen: The first is the need to have internet access in order to function, which makes them unusable in remote situations such as those noted above, with the exception of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-4">REDCap</rs>. The second is that many of them are integrated into select data management systems. To use a specific EDC system one must also use a specific database and presumably port any pre-existing data into it. This is less attractive when the research group has a mature data management system in place for their neuroimaging data, and is looking to add EDC for clinical assessments.</p>
            <p>The solution is a system that combines the automated data capture of web-based self-assessment with the dynamics of a clinician's expertise and needs, and the abilities to work off-line until interface with an arbitrary database is needed. The <rs corresp="#f75beef9fa-software-7" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Mind Research Network (MRN)</rs> has developed a software tool for the real-time acquisition and validation of clinical assessments in remote environments: The <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-7">clinical assessment and remote administration tablet (CARAT)</rs>. We have developed this tool on a <rs corresp="#f75beef9fa-software-70" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Microsoft</rs> <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-70">Windows</rs> PC tablet system, and it has been used successfully to collect and administer clinical assessments in several large-scale studies. It has proven to be incredibly valuable in confirming that data collection across multiple research groups is performed similarly, quickly, and with accountability for incomplete datasets. Here we present its specifications and current availability, focusing on its use in conjunction with the Functional Biomedical Informatics Research Network (FBIRN) multi-site neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia, and the FBIRN Human Imaging Databases <ref type="bibr">(Keator et al., 2008)</ref>; and in conjunction with the MRN data management system <ref type="bibr">(Bockholt et al., 2010; Scott et al., 2011)</ref>, a centralized institutional level system managing multiple federated studies simultaneously. It has also been applied within an <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-71">OpenClinica</rs> <rs corresp="#f75beef9fa-software-71" resp="#curator" type="version">1</rs> data management system <ref type="bibr">(Bockholt et al., in preparation)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Linking to other databases. To ensure database platform and schema independence, this step is performed by a SOAP web service that is individually customized by a software engineer associated with the required database platform. This web service need be written only once per database schema and then applied to all studies that are stored using the same database schema. Modification for communication with FBIRN Human Imaging Database (FBIRN HID) 2 led to the addition of the ability to export assessments in different XML formats. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-11">CARAT</rs> can export the subject's data using the XML-based Clinical Experiment Data Exchange (XCEDE) schema, which the FBIRN HID uses to import data 3 .</p>
            <p>Real-time data validation. The validation steps can be set per question per assessment, and can be changed for different visits within a study if needed. They include checking required fields for completion, data type (e.g., numeric, character string, or date), bounds-checking (e.g., systolic blood pressure is a number between 0 and 300), and question dependencies (e.g., Question 2 "How many cigarets do you smoke a day?" does not need to be answered if the answer to Question 1 "Do you smoke?" is NO). <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-12">CARAT</rs> provides some complex controls like tree selects, and repeating groups of fields, as one might use for a medication or drug history. During an interview, the rater is notified immediately when a required field is skipped or data entered does not meet quality criteria, but the software does not require the rater to fix the data immediately. This allows the rater to complete the interview smoothly and fix data issues at a later time if necessary. CRFs that do not pass data quality validation may be stored on the rater's tablet and edited at any time, but they may not be submitted to the database until all issues are resolved. Examples are shown in <ref type="figure">Figures 4 and 6</ref>.</p>
            <p>In <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-13">CARAT</rs>, XML layout specifications for CRFs are created using a graphic tool that uses the SOAP web service to pull the question metadata from the study protocols already in the database. The layout tool is designed for raters or other study staff to use to create detailed layouts, including GUI elements and data validation, with a minimum of technical expertise. Questions may be dragged and dropped into a GUI form and then modified as necessary. If metadata about a particular CRF question does not exist in a database, the metadata can be provided directly in the layout(4) Conditional skipping of questions: Here, since the participant answered "Yes" about English being their primary language, the follow-up question is not required. (5) Required fields are marked with a red icon.</p>
            <p>The layout is then exported as an XML CRF specification to be included in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-14">CARAT</rs>.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-15">CARAT</rs> software has spent the last almost 3 years in longterm piloting with multiple studies. During this time, it has been through three rounds of enhancement in response to user feedback. User needs led to extensive expansion of the options for assessment appearance, keyboard shortcuts for studies that made more use of the keyboard, expansion of user preferences so that default behavior better matches specific study needs, allowing sorting and re-ordering of assessments on the fly, creating missing data explanation fields, turning pen use on and off as needed, and various other usability changes.</p>
            <p>Navigation of lengthy CRFs on paper is often not linear; clinicians may skip back and forth as the flow of the interview require. To recreate this in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-16">CARAT</rs>, users may navigate through the CRF pages using the arrow buttons in the lower right-hand corner, or they may go to a specific page using the navigation tree.</p>
            <p>When Complete or Review buttons at the top of the form are clicked, the prototype validates all questions in the CRF and displays a list of errors for the user to address, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Clicking or tapping the error listing takes the user to the question that needs to be addressed. CRFs may be edited and saved with known errors, but they may not be submitted to the database until all errors are addressed. The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-17">CARAT</rs> interface includes the ability to create an exception, explaining how the data were not able to be collected, if this is the case. This method ensures that an error does not obstruct an interview, but that all issues are addressed before the data appears in the database.</p>
            <p>This prototype has been in long-term pilot with multiple groups, of which we will describe two examples: Psychopathy Research under Dr. Kent Kiehl located at the MRN and FBIRN <ref type="bibr">(Keator et al., 2008; Potkin et al., 2009)</ref>, a collaboration featuring more than 10 distributed sites. These groups use different database schemas and have different data collection needs. These projects have been instrumental in gathering user feedback as well as demonstrating the usefulness of the software in real assessment gathering conditions. We have recently added a self-assessment mode to allow the same <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-18">CARAT</rs> system to be used in computer labs for self-assessments.</p>
            <p>With the exception of the upload of completed CRFs to a database, all major functions on <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-19">CARAT</rs> are available without internet or network access. Asynchronous updates, however, can lead to duplicate or existing data in the centralized data management system, which must not be overwritten. <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-20">REDCap</rs> has developed an elegant system to manage these issues <ref type="bibr">(Borlawsky et al., 2011)</ref>;<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-21">CARAT</rs> handles those problems to some extent, though not as completely. At this point, the MICIS and BIRN web services will check against the subject ID, assessment, study, and visit to see if duplicate data already exists in the database. We are working to make the generic web service more flexible and secure for these issues while maintaining its agnostic approach to database schema Clinical assessment and remote administration tablet was designed and implemented on a <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-22">Windows</rs> system. Convertible tablets, for which <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-23">Windows</rs> was the dominant operating system, are being overwhelmed by the new popularity of slate tablets. Slates tend to run <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-24">Android</rs> or <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-25">iOS</rs>, as well as <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-26">Windows</rs>; <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-27">CARAT</rs> is being re-factored to be platform-independent, to take advantage of these new options.</p>
            <p>A challenge specific to multi-site studies is the need to have all users have the same implementation of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-28">CARAT</rs>, the same forms and layouts. For studies which decide on their protocol and never vary from it, it is not a challenge to set up one instantiation of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-29">CARAT</rs> and disseminate it to all the participating sites. Many clinical and research studies, however, find that they need new or revised CRFs over the course of a study; confirming all sites are using the same version has been a challenge for <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-30">CARAT</rs> in multi-site studies. Future versions of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-31">CARAT</rs> will implement automatic update detection, so that all sites are running with the latest version for a given study whenever they have internet access.</p>
            <p>Electronic data capture of the assessments and interviews associated with clinical neuroimaging studies have been used in many studies, and the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-32">CARAT</rs> system which we present has been tested in a wide range of study situations. The needs which EDC systems commonly address include using a web interface to transmit data directly into a database, usually over the internet so that only a browser is needed for the user. The ability to handle complex forms, multiple types of questions, conditional branching, and constraint checking is also needed for an adequate system <ref type="bibr">(Harris et al., 2009)</ref>. Unique needs for many research programs include the ability to use a tablet system rather than a desktop or laptop, and to work where the internet is not available, without giving up the ability to capture the data and transmit it directly to a study database. The demands of neuroimaging studies includes the ability to identify the subject's imaging data with their clinical and other data, preferably within a centralized multi-modal data repository.</p>
            <p>The first advantage of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-33">CARAT</rs> is that it was designed to work on a tablet, mimicking natural interviewing style. The use of the stylus on the tablet screen has been popular with researchers who prefer the pen and paper approach. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-34">CARAT</rs> also includes the ability to handle constraint checking and complex conditional branching, similar to what <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-35">REDCap</rs> provides. Data validation supports regular expressions, so error detection can become extremely detailed. Responses can be validated not just by data type (date, number, character string, etc.) but by complex ranges of these in almost any combination. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-36">CARAT</rs> at the moment does not implement the ability to reference multiple questions in a single validation rule, however; it can require the response field be filled in according to highly complex string-formation rules combining letters and numbers, but we can't say that the response must be less the answer to the previous question plus 100, for example. That has not been a common request from users, though it could be implemented if needed.</p>
            <p>An appropriate EDC solution must also provide a high degree of CRF customization to accommodate the almost constant stream of new assessments, and modifications to existing assessments, which comes with many research programs. The CRFs and other assessment forms must be extremely customizable, allowing for entry of common, rare, and unique study-specific assessments. It should be modifiable by the research team that is collecting and/or managing the data, rather than depending on the original software developers -ease of use in the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-37">CARAT</rs> layout system is currently a focus of ongoing development. Ideally, for non-copyright material, a repository of assessments should be available, built from studies already using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-38">CARAT</rs>, so that the forms for a new study can be set up quickly and re-use existing forms automatically whenever possible, similar to the system implemented in <ref type="bibr">(El Fadly et al., 2011)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Data-gathering software appropriate to the specific needs of clinical research interviews is unlikely to be widely adopted if it cannot conform to the data storage solutions already employed at mature research sites. It may or may not be possible to integrate data from independent software packages that employ their own distinct database schemas. The software must be able to plug into the existing frameworks already in use by mature research programs. It must have a mechanism to communicate with existing databases and schemas, be they off-the-shelf like <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-39">OpenClinica</rs> or custom solutions such as <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-40">REDCap</rs>. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-41">CARAT</rs> has the flexibility Frontiers in Neuroinformatics www.frontiersin.org to interact with arbitrary databases, rather than a single proprietary database specialized for clinical assessments, thus allowing the ability of combining clinical and imaging data within a single repository. <ref type="bibr">Franklin et al. (2011)</ref> reviewed several common EDC systems within their needs for small-scale clinical trials; their list of valued features overlapped with the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-42">CARAT</rs> specifications to some extent. Their list included availability of training materials, the presence of site and user roles and permissions, ease of designing CRFs including error detection, the ability to create a visit schedule for data-entry, and the ease in importing or exporting data in a standards-compliant way. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-43">CARAT</rs> provides training materials for the user interface, and the developers' manual for the web interface is in development. The fact that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-44">CARAT</rs> is built to work with both MICIS and HID and to be expandable to other database system means many of the security issues and permissions are considered the purview of the database, however, rather than the data collection system. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-45">CARAT</rs> can validate that the rater's username and password is a valid rater for the study, and that the subject ID being used is for a subject who is enrolled in the study. Other levels of permission that are not related to collecting assessment data are not within the scope of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-46">CARAT</rs> at this time.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-47">CARAT</rs> software is available from www.nitric.org, under multiple licenses. For the research community with free re-use, it is available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). If the software is to be used with a commercial interest, other licenses can be negotiated.</p>

            <p>All patients underwent CT scans prior to the administration of imatinib and 4 10 weeks after the initiation of the imatinib therapy. Ten patients underwent two or more follow-up CT scans 4 22 months after the initiation of the treatment with imatinib. The CT scan data were available on a picture archiving and communications system (PACS; Marotech, Seoul, Korea) for all patients. The CT scans were performed using a Somatom Plus-4 (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany), a HiSpeed Advantage scanner (General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI), or a MX8000 four-detector row CT scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Cleveland, OH). Each patient receivedC 120 mL of a nonionic contrast material (Iopromide, Ultravist 370; Schering Korea, Seoul, Korea) through an 18-gauge angiographic catheter inserted into a forearm vein. The contrast material was injected at a rate of 2.5 mL/sec using an automatic injector. In the case of the single-detector scanner, a helical CT scan was performed with the following parameters: 5 7 mm collimation, 1:1 table pitch, and 5 7 mm reconstruction intervals. In the case of the MX8000 scanner, the parameters were 2.5 mm detector collimation, 20 mm/sec table speed, 5 mm slice thickness, and a 5 mm reconstruction interval. The delay between the contrast material administration and scanning was 55 70 seconds. Two radiologists reviewed all of the CT scans retrospectively, and the final interpretations were reached by consensus. All images were reviewed on a 2,000 2,000 PACS monitor. The presence of the metastatic lesion and its size before and after the imatinib treatment were compared. The metastatic lesions were assessed according to their location, size (greatest diameter), attenuation, and enhancing pattern. If multiple metastatic lesions were detected, the largest lesion was recorded. For the objective analysis, the CT attenuation value was measured in a circular region of interest with a diameter of 10 mm. The CT attenuation value was measured three times by a single radiologist and the mean value was recorded. In the case of a heterogeneous mass, the CT attenuation value was measured in the solid portion of the tumor. The CT attenuation value before and after the imatinib treatment was compared using the paired t-test. Statistical analyses were performed using a computer software package (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ed22fe84dc-software-0">SPSS</rs>, version <rs corresp="#ed22fe84dc-software-0" resp="#annotator2" type="version">10.0</rs>; <rs corresp="#ed22fe84dc-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SPSS</rs>, Chicago, Ill). A p value of less than .05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.</p>

            <p>Objectives: Extraarticular Reconstructions (ERs), isolated or in association with Intraarticular ACL Reconstructions (IRs) were popular in the eighties. However they were almost completely given up as a result of a consensus conference organized by <ref type="bibr">AOSSM in 1989 in Snowmass (Co)</ref> where the experts concluded that ERs, even if biomechanically justified, were unable to provide any improvement in clinical results with greater morbidity, higher risk of complications and increased rate of degenerative osteoarthritis (DOA). However, as since then the surgical techniques and postoperative rehabilitation have radically changed, it could be helpful to reconsider ERs and their long term effect on knee stability and on DOA. Methods: One hundred consecutive patients who underwent an anatomic single bundle ACL reconstruction with hamstrings were re-evaluated at a minimum follow up of eleven years. In 23 cases (group B), due to the presence of a Pivot Shift test graded as +++ or in cases of athletes involved in high risk sports, a lateral tenodesis (Coker/Arnold) was associated. The other 77 patients, where an isolated IR was performed with the same technique (group A), served as control. All patients followed the same, standard postoperative rehabilitation program. At follow up Lysholm, IKDC and Tegner activity scores were used. A side to side maximum manual (S/S MM) KT1000 measurement was done. Comparative weight bearing antero-posterior and lateral radiograms were performed and analyzed according to Fairbank, Kellgren and IKDC classification. Tibio-femoral and patella-femoral joints were analyzed separately. Statistical analysis was performed using Student t-test, Pearson chi-square test with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="f3f19a3fe7-software-0">SPPS</rs> <rs corresp="#f3f19a3fe7-software-0" resp="#annotator4" type="version">9.0</rs> software. Results: Group A and B were homogeneous for sex and age. At final follow up seven patients were lost. Subjectively Lysholm score, IKDC and Tegner Activity score improved significantly in both groups with no significant difference. Objectively the number of patient categorized as A and B according to the IKDC was significantly higher in group B than in group A ( P=0.05). Considering as a failure a S/S M/M difference &gt; 5mm or a Pivot Shift test graded as ++ or +++ or a recurrence of any giving way episode, we found 7 cases in group A and no cases in group B (P=0.006). Radiogical evaluation showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups in all scales in both femoro-tibial and patello-femoral joints.</p>

Quantitative reverse transcription PCRs (qRT-PCRs) were performed using 20 ng of cDNA and 300 nM of each primer in a 20 ll reaction volume with SYBR GREEN PCR MasterMix (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Three biological and three technical replicates for each reaction were analysed on an ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) with a first step of 95&#176;C for 15 min followed by 40 cycles of 95&#176;C for 15 s and 60&#176;C for 1 min. Melting curves were generated using the following program: 95&#176;C for 15 s, 60&#176;C for 15 s, and 95&#176;C for 15 s. Transcript abundance was quantified using standard curves for both target and reference genes, which were generated from serial dilutions of PCR products from corresponding cDNAs. Transcript abundance was normalized to the reference genes [PsAct (EF585293) and AtAct (NM_121018)] that show high stability across the different treatments.</p>

            <p>Phylogenetic analysis of isolates. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from isolate growth cultures oxidizing AH 2 DS with a MoBio Power Soil DNA kit (MoBio Laboratories Inc., Solana Beach, CA) per the manufacturer's protocol. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified from gDNA extracts with universal primers 27F (5=-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG) and 1492R (5=-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT) (F stands for forward and R stands for reverse in the primer names). 16S rRNA gene amplification was performed with Takara Ex Taq HS according to the manufacturer's protocol. Isolation of genomic DNA, 16S rRNA gene-specific PCR, and sequencing of PCR products were conducted as described previously <ref type="bibr">(27, 31)</ref>. 16S rRNA gene sequences were aligned with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="fb11a3ca30-software-5">MUSCLE</rs> <rs corresp="#fb11a3ca30-software-5" resp="#annotator3" type="version">3.6</rs> (47), and Bayesian analysis of 16S rRNA gene phylogeny was completed with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="fb11a3ca30-software-4">MrBayes</rs> <rs corresp="#fb11a3ca30-software-4" resp="#annotator3" type="version">3.2</rs> <ref type="bibr">(48, 49)</ref>. The program was run with four chains until the standard deviation of the split frequencies was stabilized below 0.01, in this case for 450,000 generations, with a sample frequency of 1,000. The first 25% of the samples were discarded for accurate estimation of the posterior probability distribution of the summary tree.</p>
            <p>PhyloChip arrays from the initial inoculum, no-donor control column, oxidized humic substance column, and reduced humic substance column. For bacterial richness, a taxon was considered present in the sample when 90% or more of its assigned probe pairs for its corresponding probe set were positive (positive fraction of &#1350;0.90). To determine the differences in bacterial community composition, nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was performed on PhyloChip hybridization data using the statistical package <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="fb11a3ca30-software-6">Primer V</rs> (<rs corresp="#fb11a3ca30-software-6" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Plymouth Marine Laboratory</rs>, Plymouth, United Kingdom). To discriminate the bacterial populations enriched in the humic acid-treated columns, a subtractive analysis between the controls and humic acid-treated columns was performed.</p>
            <p>With the intention of illustrating the phylogenetic response to HA across the 5 most enriched phyla, a maximum likelihood tree was constructed using the 365 16S rRNA sequences from the five dominant phyla demonstrated to be enriched relative to the control in either or both columns treated with humic acid.

            <p>The optimal policy under commitment can be computed by formulating an infinite-horizon Lagrangian problem in which the central bank maximizes conditional expected social welfare subject to the full set of nonlinear constraints implied by the private sector's behavioral equations and the market-clearing conditions of the model economy.33 The first-order conditions of this problem are obtained by differentiating the Lagrangian with respect to each of the endogenous variables (including the policy instrument) and setting these derivatives to 0. Of course, performing these derivations by hand would be extremely tedious; thus, we utilize the symbolic <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="d0872990c0-software-simple-0">Matlab</rs> procedures developed by <ref type="bibr">Levin and Lopez-Salido (2004)</ref> <ref type="bibr">34</ref> We then proceed to analyze the behavior of the economy under optimal policy by combining the central bank's first-order conditions together with the private sector's behavioral equations and the marketclearing conditions. Thus, the size of the model is much larger under the optimal policy because these first-order conditions take the place of a single interest rate reaction function, while the set of Lagrange multipliers is added to the list of model variables. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that no new parameters have been added to the model because the central bank's first-order conditions involve the same structural parameters as in the behavioral equations and marketclearing conditions.</p>

            <p>After fasting for least 6 h, patients were administered 370 MBq of 18 F-FDG intravenously. All patients were instructed to rest comfortably for 60 min and to urinate before scanning. Wholebody PET-CT images were obtained with a Discovery ST scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). Seven to eight frames (3 min per frame) of emission PET data were acquired in 3D mode after a non-contrast CT scan from the base of the skull to the upper thigh (tube rotation time of 1 s per revolution, 120 kV, 60 mA, 7.5 mm per rotation and an acquisition time of 60.9 s for a scan length of 867 mm). Emission PET images were reconstructed using an iterative method (ordered-subsets expectation maximization with 2 iterations and 30 subsets; field of view, 600 mm; slice thickness, 3.27 mm) and attenuation corrected with noncontrast CT. Two nuclear medicine physicians reviewed 18 F-FDG PET-CT images on an <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="ecc2404bb9-software-0">AW workstation</rs> (v. <rs corresp="#ecc2404bb9-software-0" resp="#annotator5" type="version">4.4</rs>; <rs corresp="#ecc2404bb9-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">GE Healthcare</rs>, Milwaukee, WI) by consensus. Focal 18 F-FDG uptake with intensity higher than that of normal background soft tissue on PET image was considered to be positive for metastasis. CT images were used for anatomic localization, but not for decision making. For the semi-quantitative analysis of <ref type="bibr">18</ref> F-FDG uptake, standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated based on injected dose and body weight. Circular regions of interest were placed on the ALN and maximum SUVs (SUV max ) were recorded.

Person records in the census contain date of birth, gender, race, ethnicity, and relationship to the head of household (HH), the last of which permits inference about certain relationships within a household. Marital status is modeled for graduate students who are either the HH or listed as a spouse or unmarried partner of the HH. Individuals are characterized as having children when they are, or are married to, the HH and there are (step) children of the HH present. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> 1 This approach provides valuable information but has two main limitations. First, we can only infer marital status The PIK is used to link to W-2 earnings, which cover total annual wages, tips, and other compensation from the job with the highest earnings in each year from 2005 and 2012. Linking to the LEHD provides establishment identifiers, and linking on those establishment identifiers to the BR, LBD, and ILBD provides sector of employment.</p>

            <p>As in most exercises of this type, the equity-premium puzzle remains a serious problem. For income and dividend processes and participation rates based on historical data, the model predicts an unrealistically small equity premium. We have increased the assumed volatility of aggregate income to increase the predicted premium, but want to emphasize that this may not be a neutral adjustment with respect to the other quantities of interest.10 4.2.1 Income and Preferences Let y(t) -log[Ya(t)/Ya(t -1)] be the growth rate of aggregate nonmarketed income at time t. Then the aggregate state of the economy is given by z(t) = [y(t) d(t)]', which is assumed to be generated by a Markov chain. To calibrate a process for z(t) we assume that a period corresponds to 25 years. The first period roughly corresponds to the working years between age 40 and retirement, and the second period is the time in retirement. Over the period 1889 to 1985, the average annual (log) growth rate in real aggregate consumption was 1.7% with a standard deviation of 3.5%. So that the model will produce a nonnegligible equity premium, we assume that the standard deviation of the aggregate growth rate in the model is 1.5 times the historical standard deviation of aggregate 9. The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="da8a45d63e-software-simple-0">Matlab</rs> code is available upon request. 10. Recently <ref type="bibr">Campbell and Cochrane (1998)</ref> suggested that time-varying habit provides a higher estimate of the equity premium in a model based on aggregate consumption. However, <ref type="bibr">Cochrane (1997)</ref> claims that this preference specification cannot account for the recent run-up in stock prices.consumption. For the same reason, we assume that annual income growth is independently and identically distributed over time, although in fact it is slightly negatively autocorrelated. This implies a 25-year average (log) growth rate of 42.5% with a standard deviation of 17.5%. This distribution is discretized by assuming that y takes on the values 0.16 and 0.69 with equal conditional probability. The capital share in total income averages approximately 30%. Consistent with the aggregate statistics reported in <ref type="bibr">Heaton and Lucas (1998)</ref>, we assume that only half of this capital income is actually tradable. The nontradable portion, generated by private business holdings, is accounted for in nonmarketed income. Since dividends in the model are scaled relative to nonmarketed income, this means that we require d(t) to average 18%. In most of the calculations d(t) is fixed at 18%. In other experiments described below, we assume a more volatile dividend process to proxy for a lack of diversification.11</p>

            <p>In order to determine whether the OXPHOS defect in cells overexpressing PDE12 is a consequence of impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis, we labelled the de novo synthesized mitochondrially encoded subunits of the electron transport chain with radioactive methionine. After the inhibition of cytosolic translation, the incorporation of <ref type="bibr">35</ref> S-Met into mitochondrial proteins was analysed over a time course of 4 days in HEK293T cells overexpressing PDE12 or the E351A catalytic mutant <ref type="figure">(Figure 6A)</ref>. Translation of all mitochondrially encoded respiratory chain subunits was compromised upon the induction of PDE12 overexpression and the incorporationwere analysed by northern blots using probes specific for all mitochondrial transcripts. Nuclear-encoded 28 S rRNA was used as a loading control. (D) Quantification of steady-state levels of mitochondrial transcripts in cells overexpressing PDE12. The values of the relative RNA levels (mt-RNA/28 S rRNA) were obtained by quantifying PhosphorImager scans of northern blots using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="b832d821d4-software-simple-4">ImageQuant</rs> software and normalized for the values obtained from uninduced cells. *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.001; n = 3, Error bars = 1 SD. (E) mtDNA copy number in cells overexpressing PDE12. Comparative Q-PCR of the mitochondrial CytB gene and single copy nuclear gene (APP) was used with total DNA isolated from cells overexpressing PDE12 for the indicated time. *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.001; n = 3, Error bars = 1 SD. of <ref type="bibr">35</ref> S-Met was $15% of those in uninduced cells <ref type="figure">(Figure 6B)</ref>. Overexpression of the E351A mutant did not have any appreciable effect upon mitochondrial protein synthesis <ref type="figure">(Figure 6B)</ref>. Next, we carried out gradient sedimentation analyses of cell extracts from cells overexpressing PDE12 for 4 days and control cells in order to investigate the integrity of the mitochondrial ribosome <ref type="figure">(Figure 6C)</ref>. In this method, we detected the 28 S (small) and 39 S (large) subunits by western blotting of gradient fractions. We used DAP3/MRPS29 as a marker for the 28 S ribosomal subunit and MRPL3 as a marker for the 39 S subunit. The analyses of sedimentation of mitoribosomal subunits upon overexpression of PDE12 revealed: (i) deficiency of assembled 28 S mitoribosomal subunits as compared to the control and (ii) anomalous sedimentation of the 39 S subunits that was shifted towards slower migrating species <ref type="figure">(Figure 6C)</ref>. These changes in mitoribosomes were not due to any alteration in the length of the mitochondrial rRNAs, based on RNase protection assays of 12 S and 16 S rRNA (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S4A-B)</ref>. Nor was the steady-state level or length of 7 mt-tRNAs (Ser-UCN, Leu-UUR, Thr, Gln, Pro, Lys and Phe) affected by elevated PDE12 expression (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S4C-D)</ref>. However, in the case of tRNASer-AGY the steady-state level of the full-length molecule was $60% of the control value after 4 days of PDE12 overexpression and a species of lower molecular mass was detected. A similar truncated form of tRNASer-AGY, albeit of much lower abundance, was observed in control cells (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S4C)</ref>. Mutant tRNA levels considerably &gt;50% are needed to produce a mitochondrial translation defect <ref type="bibr">(24)</ref> and so the observed inhibition of mitochondrial translation is most likely attributable to the shortening of the mt-RNA poly(A) tails, owing to mitochondrial ribosome instability and/or impaired assembly.</p>

            <p>Many sRNAs act on gene expression by base pairing to target mRNAs and influencing either the stability of these targets or the rate of translation or both. To get a hint on possible targets of SorY we compared the transcriptomes of a control strain harbouring an empty vector (2.4.1pBBR) and of the overexpressing strain (2.4.1pBBRSorYi) after 10 min of 1 O 2 stress by microarray analysis <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1)</ref>. From 3976 genes with a reliable A-value 17 protein coding genes showed a log 2 fold change of &gt; 0.6 or &lt; &#161;0.6 between the 2 strains <ref type="table">Table 1)</ref>. Putative interaction of the mRNAs transcribed from these genes and SorY were predicted by the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f0bb4d7298-software-simple-0">IntaRNA</rs> tool. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the predicted parameters of genes with expression changes for which an energy value of less than &#161;10 kcal/mol was calculated for a putative interaction. The effect of SorY on mRNA levels was confirmed by real time RT-PCR for RSP_2400, RSP_0097, sufC, and adhI <ref type="figure">Fig. 2A)</ref>. The microarray data for flgF could not be confirmed and RSP_0432 was not tested, since no function for this gene is predicted. Real time RT-PCR also demonstrated that deletion of SorY had an opposite effect on the transcript levels of these mRNAs than overexpression of SorY <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2A)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Microarray analysis was performed as described before <ref type="bibr">(Mank et al., 2012)</ref>. Total RNA, obtained from aerobically grown cultures of strains 2.4.1pBBRSorYi and 2.4.1pBBR after 10 min of photooxidative stress, was chemically labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 (Kreatech; EA-022/EA-023), respectively. Multiarray analysis was performed with the Bio-conductor package <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f0bb4d7298-software-simple-1">Limma</rs> for <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f0bb4d7298-software-simple-2">R</rs>. On the basis of calculated MA plots, genes were considered reliable if the average signal intensity [A-value: 1/2 log2 (Cy3&#163;Cy5)] was 12. To filter out potentially insignificant changes among genes that passed the reliability criterion, a cutoff value was applied; i.e., those genes were retained whose average expression value of 2.4.1pBBRSorYi (a) compared with the average value of the control treatment 2.4.1pBBR (b) was either a log2 Fold Change of 0.6 or a &#161;0.6. Microarray data are deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/geo/; accession no. GSE63328).</p>

We log 2 -normalized each ChIP-seq sample to the mock IP control using the function get.smoothed.enrichment.mle() in the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-2">R package 'spp'</rs> (32) version <rs corresp="#f76f57dbbc-software-2" resp="#annotator2" type="version">1.11</rs> with a 200 basepair (bp) bandwidth and 100 bp stepsize. '<rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-3">spp</rs>' was downloaded from <rs corresp="#f76f57dbbc-software-3" resp="#curator" type="url">http://compbio.med. harvard.edu/Supplements/ChIP-seq/</rs>.</p>
            <p>We performed a smoothing step to control for the local dependency of the signal in linear genomic space, since we are interested in identifying 3D hotspots of physically proximal yet genomically distal ChIP-seq peaks in subsequent analyses. Specifically, we smoothed each normalized ChIP-seq signal along each chromosome arm using <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-simple-17">SuperSmoother</rs> <ref type="bibr">(33)</ref>, which is implemented as supsmu() in <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-4">R</rs> (version <rs corresp="#f76f57dbbc-software-4" resp="#annotator2" type="version">3.0.2</rs>) package '<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-simple-20">stats</rs>', with the span determined by cross-validation. We then took the residuals of each smoothed normalized signal -this constitutes the final 'ChIP-seq peak height' that we proceeded to superpose onto the 3D genome reconstruction.</p>
            <p>The 3D genome reconstruction consists of a series of beads spaced along each chromosome; each bead has a genomic position and (X,Y,Z) coordinates. For each ChIP-seq input, we binned its peak height data (i.e. the residuals of the smoothed log 2 -normalized signal) such that each bin was centered on a bead. We then assigned to each bead the most extreme ChIP-seq peak height (positive or negative) from the bin centered on that bead. The result is a 3D chromatin configuration reconstruction overlaid with functional genomic data: each bead now has a genomic position, physical coordinates (X,Y,Z) and a ChIP-seq peak height value. We visualized this superposed 3D reconstruction in <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-23">MacPy- MOL</rs> <rs corresp="#f76f57dbbc-software-23" resp="#annotator2" type="version">1.3</rs> (34) by first converting the data to the Protein Data Bank (PDB) file format <ref type="bibr">(35)</ref> with the ChIP-seq peak height value rescaled as the temperature factor (B-factor) in the PDB file.</p>
            <p>We applied <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-simple-23">PRIM</rs> using the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-simple-24">R package 'prim'</rs> (36) to discover 3D hotspots in ChIP-seq peak height superposed on the 3D reconstruction. We used the default parameter settings peel alpha = 0.5 and paste alpha = 0.01 (we explored alternative settings subsequently) and used min beads = 25, the smallest parameter setting out of those tested (10, 25, 50 and 100) for which inter-chromosomal hotspots could be detected. After applying PRIM, each bead in the superposed 3D reconstruction now has a genomic position, physical (X,Y,Z) coordinates, a ChIP-seq peak height value and a numerical PRIM box label (the largest numerical label is a placeholder for the beads that were not boxed). We estimated the significance of all of the PRIM boxes (except for the placeholder) by permutations as follows. We preserved the mapping of beads to PRIM boxes, and then permuted the ChIP-seq peak height along each chromosome. Then, we computed the mean ChIP-seq peak height for each PRIM box from the permuted data. We repeated this for a total of 10 5 permutations. The P-value of each box was estimated by comparing its mean ChIP-seq peak height from the observed data to its mean ChIP-seq peak height values from the permuted data. We ranked these potential 3D hotspots by P-value and Holm-adjusted the P-values to account for multiple testing. To gauge the effect size of the mean ChIP-seq peak height of each hotspot, we also computed Z-scores: the difference between the observed mean outcome and the mean of the mean outcomes across all permutations, divided by the standard deviation of the mean outcomes across all permutations.</p>
            <p>We applied k-NN regression to the ChIP-seq peak height superposed on the 3D reconstruction using the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-simple-25">R package 'FNN'</rs> <ref type="bibr">(37)</ref>, where k is the specified number of physically proximal beads to be analyzed together as a grouping. First, we selected 'seed' beads evenly spaced along each chromosome by a bead interval of 0.5*k. Next, for each seed bead, we found its k nearest beads in Euclidean distance via the function knn.index() to create a bead grouping. Finally, we found the mean ChIP-seq peak height of each bead grouping via the function knn.reg() and ranked the list of bead groupings by mean ChIP-seq peak height.</p>
            <p>We normalized the S. cerevisiae contact data from <ref type="formula">(7)</ref> using <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-simple-26">HiCNorm</rs> (25) (see 'Methods') and then generated a new 3D genome reconstruction from the normalized contact data via the constrained optimization approach from (7) as per <ref type="formula">(17)</ref> (the original study <ref type="formula">(7)</ref> preceded the formalization of pipelines for normalizing Hi-C contact data <ref type="bibr">(25,38- 40)</ref>).</p>

For total carbonyl quantification, equal quantities of proteins were loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE 12% (v/v). Chemicals for SDS-PAGE were purchased from BioRad. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. For the detection of carbonylated proteins, gels were electrotransferred onto Hybond-C nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare) and incubated with anti-DNP antibodies (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich). Carbonylated proteins were revealed by a fluorescent anti-rabbit IgG 800CW (1:15,000) polyclonal antibody (LI-COR). Densitometry analyses were performed using <rs corresp="#a83029d564-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">NIH</rs> <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="a83029d564-software-0">ImageJ</rs> software and the data are expressed as % volume in pixels.</p>

            <p>The following objective approach was used to delineate tracts of interest in this study. Diffusion tensor image analysis was performed using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="c6df79dbbc-software-simple-0">FFMRIB Diffusion Toolbox (FDT)</rs> included in <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="c6df79dbbc-software-4">Functional MRI of the Brain Software Library (FSL)</rs> (<rs corresp="#c6df79dbbc-software-4" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Analysis Group, FMRIB</rs>, Oxford, UK) <ref type="bibr">(Smith et al., 2004)</ref>. Image artifacts due to eddy currents and bulk head motion were minimized including b-matrix rotation during motion correction <ref type="bibr">(Smith et al., 2004)</ref>. Non-brain tissue was removed <ref type="bibr">(Smith et al., 2002)</ref>. Scalar maps for mean tract FA, MD, AD and RD were generated. Because the component diffusion metrics may provide more specific information about the underling tissue properties they were included in our analysis <ref type="bibr">(Budde et al., 2007; Song et al., 2003)</ref>. For poststroke participants, high-resolution anatomical images were masked to null voxels in the region of their lesion to minimize lesion related structural changes from affecting the registration. Affine (12 degrees-of-freedom) registration was used to obtain transformation matrices first between the diffusion and anatomical space and then between the anatomical and standard space (Montreal NeurologicInstitute 152) <ref type="bibr">(Jenkinson and Smith, 2001)</ref>. Binarized white matter masks <ref type="bibr">(Zhang et al., 2001)</ref> were realigned into diffusion space and used to constrain probabilistic tracking.</p>
            <p>Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity are known to reflect white matter integrity following stroke. Of the two metrics, in our data, MD had the lowest coefficient of variation across the 10 frontoparietal network tracts we quantified in both the poststroke and control groups, therefore it was used for the following three analyses: 1) to explain frontoparietal network variance principal components' analysis (PCA) was conducted on the correlations across the 10-frontoparietal tract mean MD values <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref>. 2) To evaluate the relationship between haptic performance of the affected hand and network integrity we examined the relationship between ipsilesional and interhemispheric tract MD and HASTe scores using Pearson correlation coefficient. Bonferroni correction for 6 comparisons resulted in an adjusted alpha of p b 0.008 <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref>. 3) To evaluate how well frontoparietal white matter integrity and other variables (age, brain volume and lesion volume) predicted HASTe scores of the affected and less affected hand we used forward stepwise multiple regression.

            <p>After ultrasound sonication for ~1 minute in the presence of MBs, 6,7 the rat was immediately placed under the objective of the two-photon microscope. The syringe was replaced by the one filled with TRITC-dextran-155 kDa solution (tracer) <ref type="figure">(Figure 3B)</ref>. The tracer solution was then introduced into the cerebral circulation via the carotid artery at a constant flow rate of ~3 mL/min <ref type="bibr">23,36</ref> for 1 minute in an interval of 5 minutes. Simultaneously, the images of the ROI containing the microvessels and the surrounding brain tissue were captured for 1 minute at 5-minute intervals up to 25 minutes. The images of 239 &#956;m &#215;239 &#956;mThe MBs at a concentration of ~1.7&#215;10 6 bubbles/mL were injected via rat carotid artery at a constant speed of ~3 mL/min, the normal blood flow velocity at the carotid artery; after 10-15 seconds, the MBs reach the microvascular bed ~100-200 &#956;m below the pia mater, <ref type="bibr">23</ref> and the FUS sonication was administrated for 1 minute. After sonication, the rat head was mounted into the multiphoton microscope, and the ROI with cerebral microvessels was found. This took about 5 minutes. Then, the images for determining the BBB solute permeability were collected for 1 minute at a rate of one image per second in a 5-minute interval, up to 25 minutes.We used the similar method as in our previous study for permeability of pial microvessels <ref type="bibr">24</ref> to determine permeability of cerebral microvessels ~100-200 &#956;m below the pia mater. Most of the microvessels chosen were post-capillary venules of 15-40 &#956;m diameter for the permeability measurement, and around 1/4 of the microvessels were capillaries. <ref type="bibr">24,35</ref> The reasons that we currently only measured the permeability of post-capillary venules and capillaries were: 1) to avoid the influence of smooth muscle cells at arteries, arterioles, and large venules, which would contract under stimuli and affect the permeability measurement; <ref type="bibr">35</ref> 2) our previous studies on the BBB permeability were also conducted on this type of post-capillary venules. <ref type="bibr">23,24</ref> The permeability was determined off-line from the pre-collected images by using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="b927e5064e-software-0">ImageJ</rs> (<rs corresp="#b927e5064e-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">National Institutes of Health</rs>, Bethesda, MD, USA). <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>A shows a typical image of an ROI (~239 &#956;m &#215;239 &#956;m) with a couple of microvessels and surrounding brain tissue.

The measuring window was ~50-100 &#956;m long and ~30-60 &#956;m wide and was set at least 10 &#956;m from the base of the bifurcation to avoid solute contamination from the side arms. The criteria for the size and placement of the measuring window were 1) the vessel segment is straight, 2) the dye does not spread out of the window during the time for permeability measurement (10-60 seconds), and 3) no dye contamination from the neighboring vessels into the window. When the criteria were satisfied, permeability was determined using the equation, <ref type="bibr">24,37</ref></p>

            <p>Demographic data (age and sex), the presence of LSTV in the radiographic images and its type was recorded in all the 3 groups. Among the patients in group B who also had an MRI, disc degeneration was assessed by Pfirrmann's grading system <ref type="figure">Fig. 4)</ref> <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. Similar grading of disc degeneration was done in group C at the non herniated levels, i.e., if M1 was the herniated level, Pfirrmann's grading was assigned to the discs at the M2 and M3levels. Based on this system, degeneration was graded as 'normal' (Pfirrmann's grade I), 'mild' (Pfirrmann's grade II) and 'advanced' (grades III-V). This was based on Lam et al. <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>'s findings of a positive provocative discography in 0%, 9%, and 71% of patients with Pfirrmann's grades I, II, III respectively and 100% in patients with Pfirrmann's grade IV and V. Lam et al. <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> stated that Pfirrmann's grading correlated strongly with the clinical symptoms. Radiological images of 1,000 consecutive patients meeting the inclusion criteria were selected for each group retrospectively from the hospital's OPD and operation records. The sample size of 3,000 was calculated from a similar study by Kong et al. <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>, in which they found no significant difference between the LSTV and non-LSTV groups in degenerative spondylolisthesis patients, with a p-value of 0.8 and a sample size of 78, using "the N master software. " In order to maintain consistency and avoid inter-observer variability, all the observations, classifications and grading were done by a single qualified spinal surgeon. The study was conducted in a major tertiary care centre with a daily OPD input of 6,000 patients including all specialities. The chi-square and proportion tests were used to compare 2 sets of variables and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was done using 'The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="bd68074248-software-simple-0">R</rs> statistical software' by a qualified statistician. Probability and relative risks were also calculated using the same software.</p>

            <p>18 F]-fluoro-3-hydroxymethylbutyl)-guanine. 9-(4-[ 18 F]-fluoro-3-hydroxymethylbutyl)-guanine ([ 18 F]FHBG) was synthesized by a modification of the method of Ponde et al. <ref type="bibr">(26)</ref> as previously described <ref type="bibr">(24)</ref>. Micropositron emission tomography. A PET reporter gene (PRG)/PET reporter probe (PRP) system was used, as previously described <ref type="bibr">(20,24,25)</ref>. HSV1-sr39tk was expressed in islets as described above. The probe, <ref type="bibr">[</ref> 18 F]F-HBG, was systemically administered and its retention in islets, after phosphorylation by rAD-TK, was quantified by micropositron emission tomography (microPET) imaging. Transplanted mice were scanned using a Focus120 (CTI Concorde) system that yielded 63 slices, 1.2 mm apart with an in-plane resolution of 2 mm full-width at half-maximum <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref>. Image reconstruction and data analysis were performed as previously described <ref type="bibr">(20,24,25)</ref>. Insulitis scoring and measurement of relative &#9252;-cell area. Paraffinembedded pancreatic sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H-E), and islets were examined in a blinded manner under the microscope to evaluate the degree of mononuclear cell infiltration. The degree of insulitis was scored in the following five categories: 0, intact islet; &#1021;25% of the islet infiltrated; 25-50% of the islet infiltrated; 50 -75% of the islet infiltrated; and&#1022;75% of the islet infiltrated. The degree of insulitis in 20 -25 islets per mouse was evaluated. &#9252;-Cell area was measured on the sections of each pancreas stained for insulin. Morphometric evaluation of the total &#9252;-cell area was performed by computer-assisted image analysis (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="b5427b7954-software-0">Northern Eclipse</rs> ver. <rs corresp="#b5427b7954-software-0" resp="#annotator5" type="version">6</rs>) using light and immunofluorescence microscopy. The area of insulin-positive cells and the total area of the tissue section were evaluated for each section, and the percentage &#9252;-cell area was calculated by the ratio of the area occupied by insulin-positive cells to the total pancreatic area.</p>
            <p>&#1001; T-cells was confirmed by flow cytometry. Migration assay. <ref type="bibr">CD4</ref> &#1001; T-cells were plated on membrane inserts (8-m pore size) in serum-free RPMI 1640, and cell migration was assayed using Transwell chambers (Corning), in the presence or absence of purified porcine kidney DPP-IV (32.1 units/mg; 100 mU/ml final concentration; provided by Dr. Hans-Ulrich Demuth, Probiodrug, Halle, Germany) (28) &#1006; DPP-IV inhibitor (100 mol/l). After 1 h, cells on the upper surface were removed mechanically, and cells that had migrated into the lower compartment were counted. The extent of migration was then expressed relative to the control sample. Rac1 guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding assay. Total cellular extracts were isolated from CD4 &#1001; T-cells and Rac1 GTP binding assays performed using the fluorophore-based RhoGEF exchange assay kit (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO), and data were normalized to protein concentration. cAMP measurements. <ref type="bibr">CD4</ref> &#1001; T-cells were incubated for 30 min with GIP, 100 nmol/l GLP-1 or 100 mU/ml purified porcine DPP-IV in the presence of 0.5 mmol/l IBMX. cAMP concentration in the cell extracts was determined using the Parameter cyclic AMP assay kit (R&amp;D Systems). Protein kinase A activity assay. Activity was measured using a protein kinase A (PKA) kinase activity assay kit (Stressgen, Mississauga, ON) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The enzyme activity was normalized to protein concentration, and data are shown as the relative activity to control. Western blot analysis. Total cellular extracts were separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad). Probing of the membranes was performed with antibodies to phosphop38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (threonine-180/tyrosine-182), p38 MAPK, phospho-p42/44 MAPK (threonine-202/tyrosine-204), p42/44 MAPK, phospho-stress-activated protein kinase/Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) (threonine-183/tyrosine-185), phospho-protein kinase B (PKB) (serine-473), phospho-PKB (threonine-308), PKB, and &#9252;-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG secondary antibodies. Statistical analysis.

            <p>We performed an intention to treat meta-analysis in line with recommendations from the Cochrane Collaboration and the PRISMA Statement <ref type="bibr">14 15</ref> and used standard software for statistical analysis (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a07c7cff43-software-0">STATA</rs> V.<rs corresp="#a07c7cff43-software-0" resp="#annotator2" type="version">9.0</rs>,<rs corresp="#a07c7cff43-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">STATA Corp</rs>, Texas, USA). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic, defined as the proportion of total variation observed between the trials attributable to differences between trials rather than sampling error (chance), with values &lt;25% considered as low and &gt;75% as high. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> The pooled effect for each grouping of trials was derived from the point estimate for each separate trial weighted by the inverse of the variance (1/SE 2 ). Continuous variable outcomes (PRU, per cent platelet inhibition) between the groups were compared with both a fixed effect model using the inverse variance method and a random effects model using the DerSimonian and Laird method. For cardiovascular outcomes, rates were expressed per patient-years to adjust for the varying duration of follow-up. Results were therefore reported as incident rate ratios (IRR) and 95% CIs with the use of both a fixed effect model using the method of Mantel and Haenszel and a random effects model using the method of DerSimonian and Laird, with the estimate of heterogeneity being taken from the Mantel-Haenszel model. Publication bias was estimated using the weighted regression tests of Begg and Egger. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> For platelet reactivity indices, analyses were stratified based on whether standard-dose (75 mg) or high-dose (150 mg) clopidogrel was used in the DAPT arm. In addition, further sensitivity analyses were performed based on the cohort enrolled: (1) acute coronary syndrome (ACS) versus not; and (2) enrolment of patients with HTPR at baseline versus not. For cardiovascular outcomes, analyses were stratified based on stent typedrug eluting stent (DES) versus Bare metal stent (BMS). A p value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant.</p>

Collected time-lapse data were registered using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="ba67264558-software-0">Imaris</rs> software (<rs corresp="#ba67264558-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Bitplane</rs>) to account for embryo drift and exported as TIF images and MOV videos. The registration correction (processed with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="ba67264558-software-simple-2">Imaris</rs> software) for embryo drift results in the changes in movie shapes seen here. Cell tracking in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="ba67264558-software-simple-3">Imaris</rs> was done in the FITC (green) channel. Parameters used included a spot diameter of 5.19 &#181;m and the "Connected Components" algorithm for tracking.</p>

            <p>1. Design oligos for the plasmid backbone (subcloning plasmid) and the selectable marker (insertion cassette). Design each oligo such that it contains 180 bp HA flanking the genomic target site and 20 bp of specific priming sequence of the insertion cassette or the subcloning plasmid <ref type="figure">(Figure 2)</ref>. NOTE: Homology arms should not contain any repetitive elements, presence of repetitive elements will result in incorrect targeting and subcloning. Repetitive elements can be detected by using web based tools such as the ''Repeat Masker''. 2. Include a unique restriction enzyme (RE) site on one of the vector oligos to linearize the gene targeting vector for ES cell targeting <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>). 3. Check oligo parameters using an <rs cert="0.5" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="e38be96101-software-simple-0">oligo analyzer</rs> program. Take care to avoid secondary structures in the priming regions. 4. Shorter HA (50 bp) of the insertion cassette is tolerated and yields lower number of recombinants but ensure that the subcloning plasmid HA is always longer (180 bp). 5. Determine the orientation of the genomic DNA insert of the particular BAC clone using web based tools like ''<rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="e38be96101-software-simple-1">cloneDB</rs>''. Establish the direction of replication from OriS by checking the map of the BAC plasmid backbone used in the BAC library construction. NOTE: OriS is usually opposite to the transcriptional direction of the Chloramphenicol (Chl) marker for all commonly used BAC plasmids. 6. Add two terminal phosphorothioate (PTO) bonds to the 5' end of the oligo that is opposite to the direction of replication on the BAC clone. Add a 5' phosphate modification to the reverse oligo <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref></p>

Responses for each question on the survey were first compared between the English and Spanish surveys. We analyzed differences between language groups as categorical variables using a Chi-squared test. When the assumptions of the Chi-squared test were not met, a Fisher's exact test was used. For this analysis, questions 1 and 20-24 were analyzed as continuous variables and compared between language groups using a two-sample t-test. Because 47 comparisons were made, we used a significance threshold of p&lt;0.0001 for all comparisons.</p>

               <title>THE TARIFF AND THE CONSTITUTION. I. CONSTITUTIONAL debate in this country has always proceeded with amazing swiftness from the opening of controversies to their settlement. The most important constitutional conflict in our history (as to the power of Congress over slavery in the territories) had received a most drastic decision within less than a lifetime of its first serious suggestion, within twenty years of the real opening of the struggle; and the dispute as to Congress' power to protect American industries by high tariffsundoubtedly second among disputed questions of national authority fairly began and practically terminated in scarcely more than a dozen years from about 1820. This sketch of the tariff controversy as it referred to the Constitution is therefore chiefly concerned with those few years -giving but brief notice to the period preceding I 820, when the argument on the constitutionality of the tariff had not sufficient interest to procure for it complete and definite statement, and dismissing with a sentence, also, the later period to the present, during most of which the constitutional objection to protective tariffs has reposed in utter neglect, save for its occasional half-serious reappearance in a party platform or over-strenuous congressional debate</title>

They should be issued by the banks under the direction and supervision of the government, or by a central bank of issue, and secured by substantial commercial paper and a reasonable cash reserve. They should be limited in quantity, so as to relieve bank officials, so far as possible, of the temptation to make hazardous loans; and they should be subject to a tax which should make them unprofitable except in times of financial stringency and of consequently high discount rates, thus assuring their early redemption and retirement. Notes issued in this way could prove no possible obstacle to sound banking. They would serve not only to meet the fluctuations in the demand for cash due to seasonal variations in different sections of the country, but also to lessen, if not to obviate, the dangers arising from a general financial crisis</title>

               <title>Within the last year or two, the " premium craze," like a moral epidemic, has spread all over the country. Scarcely a middle-class or wage-worker's family may be found, at least east of the Mississippi, where some kind of coupons are not saved and some kind of a free prize not expected. While this passion of collecting coupons or certificates, whose actual value translated into United States money equivalents is often infinitesimally small, has been a legitimate and grateful object of humor and satire, the fact has generally been overlooked that the very magnitude of the movement has made the premium a phenomenon economically important and interesting, and deserving of a careful analysis. Being a feature of retail trade exclusively, the premium or prize once more reminds us of the significant changes in the organization of the retail trade which are taking place at the present time, and which have been studied but little by the economic scholar. The purpose of the premium is advertisement and publicity. Its aim is not only to gain, but to retain, the purchaser. It is therefore the essential feature of the premium that it be given for a series of purchases, and not for one. Yet exceptions from this rule are occasionally met with. Thus within certain districts of the New York East Side a very peculiar metho,d of dealing in coiffee and tea grew up some three or four years ago. which did not persist very long, but for the time being must have been a veritable Klondyke to the enterprising dealers. With every purchase of one pound of coffee a " free " prize was givensome ware or household utensil, whose value was usually declared to be greater than the total price paid for the pound of tea and the prize. The prices paid for the tea and coffee were naturally considerably higher than the prices for similar commodities anywhere in the country. In other words, a peculiar phenomenon of a combined price for two articles absolutely unrelated to each other developed, 574</title>

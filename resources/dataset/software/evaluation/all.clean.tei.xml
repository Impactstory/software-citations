        <p>Two experienced radiologists (JCS and IK-S) evaluated the image quality, based on the exposure of non-thoracic structures. They determined the most superior and inferior parts of the body, as well as the lateral structures, which had been included within the boundaries of collimation on each chest X-ray. The readers performed their evaluations according to the European Guidelines on Quality Criteria for Diagnostic Radiographic Images in Paediatrics <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. A grading system was used to measure image quality in terms of correct collimation. Inappropriate exposure of abdominal viscera was assumed when the caudal imaging field extended below the level of L1/2 (1 point). Exposure of the cranial structures was considered inappropriate when the collimated field included more than the tip of the mandible (1 point). Inappropriate exposure of the arms was assumed when more than the diametaphyseal junction of the proximal humerus came within the field of view: part of the diaphyseal humerus (1 point); entire humerus (2 points); part of the forearm (1 point); entire forearm (2 points); hand (1 point). The maximum score was 12 points. The image quality in terms of correct collimation was graded arbitrarily as follows: 0 points = optimal image quality; 1-2 points = slightly reduced; 3-4 = moderately reduced; 5-6 = markedly reduced; and &gt;7 points = severely reduced <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). Rotation and tilting were also recorded. Radiographic errors were recorded on individual tick sheets and the information was captured in an <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC4750616-software-0">Excel</rs> spreadsheet (<rs corresp="#PMC4750616-software-0" type="creator">Microsoft</rs>, Redmond, WA).

Student's t test was used to calculate differences between DAPs. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to analyse the correlation between the radiographer's experience in performing X-rays and collimation quality.

        <p>Electronic Health Records (EHR) represent the central pillar of eHealth strategies worldwide, since they offer the capacity to support patient care, quality improvement, population health surveillance and research. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Until recently the topics of EHR and 'Consumer Health Informatics' tended to be considered separately; discussions of the former being mainly centred on healthcare institutions. Across North America and Europe there has been a gradual realization of the synergies between these two areas, manifested in the growing attention that is being paid to Personal Health Records (PHR) in both the scientific and policy literatures. The PHR is a complex construct and many have bemoaned the lack of consensus on its precise definition. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The central feature is a patient-accessible Electronic Health Record, although models vary in the source and controller of the information (healthcare provider or patient; single or multiple providers), the medium (e.g. web, kiosk, USB) and the additional functionalities associated with the software (e.g. education, prescription reordering, provider messaging, decision support). <ref type="bibr">4,5</ref> This report is concerned with one particular aspect of the PHR concept, namely online access by patients to provider-generated information that is specific to their health history and current conditions, and held in the computer systems of primary healthcare centres. We refer to this as Record Access, in line with the language adopted in recent guidelines from the Royal College of General Practitioners, <ref type="bibr">6</ref> although similar applications have also been characterised as 'tethered Personal Health Records'. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The idea of patients accessing their own health records is not a new one. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> However, the accessibility afforded by the Internet, and the capacity of emerging PHR to integrate personal health applications with provider-owned record systems, creates interesting new challenges and research questions.</p>
        <p>ii Reflecting this history, the origins of the PHR movement in the UK lie with a small number of enthusiastic GPs who pioneered record sharing with patients using computer printouts and portable downloads, latterly partnering with GP systems suppliers to provide waiting-room kiosks and online portals. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> This has yielded favourable user responses and positive impacts on knowledge, mutual trust and record accuracy, despite some concerns over security and confidentiality <ref type="bibr">11,12,13</ref> This ground-up approach sits in stark contrast to the top-down one used to introduce patient access to the NHS Summary Care Record via '<rs type="software">HealthSpace</rs>', which has so far met with limited success. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> Despite the enthusiastic response of early adopters, Record Access services remain uncommon in UK primary care and, given the caveats around privacy and liability indicated in the RCGP guidelines, more evidence is needed if they are to i This term has been used to describe emerging systems that offer Record Access as part of a broader suite of online consumer tools for administrative tasks such as appointment booking. ii The UK has a single National Health Service in which the GP acts as the first point of care, the conduit to specialist services and the coordinator of community-based follow-up. As a result they generally receive core documentation pertaining to their patients from other parts of the service, although more detailed records will remain with the specialist host. become mainstream. Questions also remain about the feasibility of integrating Record Access into professional workflow in light of the potential administrative requirements. This study aimed to examine how practices had integrated record access during the course of a one year pilot, and to identity human, organizational or technical barriers warranting attention prior to wider rollout. It also sought to explore whether some of the benefits demonstrated in US studies of PHR, such as improved provider-patient relationships, patient self-care and reduced consulting time, <ref type="bibr">15</ref> were also being felt in British health centres adopting record access.</p>

        <p>Our results with rbf / cells indicate that some level of E2F activator, not simply E2F derepression, is required to bypass cell cycle exit upon terminal differentiation. This requirement is specific to the forced proliferation of terminally differentiating cells, as cells lacking all E2F-DP activity can proliferate during normal development <ref type="bibr">(Frolov et al., 2001, 2003, 2005)</ref>. This suggests that certain critical E2F targets may require the activator function of E2F for expression in differentiating cells. Therefore, we chose to compare gene expression changes caused by high E2F activity to those caused by the loss of all E2F-DP function in terminally differentiating cells.. E2F transcriptional activation and Dp loss are highly similar, except for specific genes that require E2F activity for expression after exit. Using microarrays, we compared gene expression in E2F1-DP-expressing wings (ap-Gal4/UAS-E2F1, UAS-DP, tub-Gal80 TS ) with controls (ap-Gal4/UAS, tub-Gal80 TS ) and Dp mutant wings (w;Dp a1/a2 ) with controls (w) at three time points. (A) Heat map of transcript changes (color range indicates the log 2 ratio of expression compared with controls). All transcripts with a fold change of 1.5 or more (&gt;log 2 ± 0.6) at one or more time points are shown. Gray bars indicate transcripts that were removed from analysis because of high variability among independently replicated experiments (n = 4 for E2F; n = 3 for Dp / ). Transcripts were clustered using <rs type="software">Genesis</rs> software for hierarchical clustering. Representative genes from each major cluster are listed on the right. Typical group transcripts are up-regulated in E2F-expressing and Dp / wings at 24 and 36 h APF, whereas other transcripts are repressed or inversely regulated. Arrays for E2F and Dp / at 24 and 36 h were highly similar with a correlation coefficient of 0.74. (B) A group of 162 genes was up-regulated &gt;1.75-fold (&gt;log 2 0.82) by E2F activity at one or both time points APF but was not significantly increased in Dp</p>
        <p>We hypothesized that high APC/C activity after exit could limit E2F-induced bypass of cell cycle exit by degrading key E2F targets. This is consistent with our finding that E2F1-DPoverexpressing cells do not accumulate the known APC/C targets CycA, Geminin (Gem; <ref type="bibr">Zielke et al., 2008)</ref>, CycB, or Stg (based on a Stg-GFP fusion protein) after prolonged exit in wings or eyes (40-44 h APF; <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>, A, C, E, and G; and <ref type="figure">Fig. S3)</ref>, despite expressing high levels of cycA, gem, stg, and cycB transcripts by microarray (see supplemental dataset and <rs type="software">JCB DataViewer</rs>). In contrast, cells expressing E2F + Rca1 together accumulated CycA in wings <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6 B)</ref>, Stg-GFP in eyes <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6 D)</ref>, Gem in eyes <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6 H)</ref>, and very low levels of CycB in wings and eyes <ref type="figure">Fig. 6 F and Fig. S3)</ref>.</p>
        <p>Pupae, staged from white prepupae (0 h) at 25°C, were dissected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Pupal cuticle was removed from wings after fixation. Tissues 24-36 h APF were blocked in PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 + 1% BSA for 1 h. Tissues 36-44 h APF were blocked in PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100 + 1% BSA (PAT) overnight. For stages after 44 h APF, we incorporated a methanol dehydration series after fixation (25, 50, 75, and 100% methanol/1× PBS, 10 min each) that allowed improved antibody penetration, increased sensitivity, and BrdU detection for tissues 44-60 h APF. After step-wise rehydration, tissues were blocked in PAT overnight, and antibody staining or BrdU incorporation was performed as described previously <ref type="bibr">(Buttitta et al., 2007; Zielke et al., 2008)</ref> using Alexa Fluor 488-, Alexa Fluor 568-or Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated secondary antibodies and Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Wing hinge and notum as well as head capsule and antenna were excluded from our analyses. 1 µg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Invitrogen) was used to label nuclei. Confocal sections and differential interference contrast images were collected on a microscope (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) using a 25× objective. Single representative sections (2.2 µm) are shown, except for <ref type="figure">Fig. 3 (E and F)</ref>, which are projections of eight sections at a 1-µm interval. Images were cropped using <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC2886355-software-9">Photoshop</rs> (<rs corresp="#PMC2886355-software-9" type="creator">Adobe</rs>). Mitotic index was calculated as the mean number of PH3-positive cells/100 GFP-positive cells among multiple clones in several samples, counted blind, from at least two independent experiments.</p>
        <p>Online supplemental material <ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref> shows that bypass of cell cycle exit is limited, even in the absence of all E2F-DP function. <ref type="figure">Fig. S2</ref> shows GFP-labeled clones expressing the indicated cell cycle regulators generated using hs-FLP tub&gt;Gal4/ UAS, tub-Gal80 TS . <ref type="figure">Fig. S3</ref> shows GFP-marked clones expressing the indicated cell cycle regulators generated using hs-FLP tub&gt;Gal4/UAS, tub-Gal80 TS and examined for CycB or Gem.

Age-and sexadjusted and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the association between dairy product and milk intake and MetS components. An additional multivariate model including age, sex, physical activity, alcohol consumption, total energy intake, smoking status, education, and income as covariates was used. The proportional hazards assumption was graphically assessed using log-log plots and statistically assessed on the basis of Schoenfeld residuals <ref type="bibr">(15)</ref>. No major violations of the proportional hazard assumption were detected. A two-sided P value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

        <p>The growth of MDA-MB-231 derived tibial lesions was assessed by longitudinal bioluminescence imaging. The mice were imaged using IVIS spectrum following an intra-peritoneal injection of D-luciferin solution (PerkinElmer, USA) (150 mg/kg body weight) under gas anesthetic. Bioluminescence images were taken 20 min after D-luciferin injection and acquired until the peak signal was reached.

Continuous variables were expressed as meanAESD and analyzed by unpaired t tests, with Welch adjustment when necessary. Continuous variables that violated the normality assumption were expressed as median and 25th to 75th percentiles and analyzed by a Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were expressed as absolute (n) and relative (%) frequency and were analyzed by the Pearson 2-test or the Fisher exact test whenever appropriate. Significant level was considered with P&lt;0.05. Univariate analysis was carried out for patient data, and multivariate analysis by logistic regression was used to obtain data about the risk factors for AKI at the 3 time points: preoperative, ICU admittance, and 24 hours after ICU admittance. In the multivariate analysis, results were expressed by the odds ratio and the 95% confidence interval. The regression b of those variables obtained from logistic regression were used to develop the final 3 stage scores to predict CSA-AKI. The 1152 patients in the validation cohort were scored for validation, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) as well as Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test were applied to estimate the reliability of the scoring for predicting CSA-AKI.</p>

        <p>Smart contracts are self-executing contracts. 8 They can be used to stipulate that a Bitcoin payment will be executed only when a certain condition is met. The Ethereum network is currently the leader in the field of smart contracts. Similar to Bitcoin, it is based on blockchain technology and provides a native cryptoasset, called Ether. In contrast to Bitcoin, Ethereum provides a more flexible scripting language and is able to track contractual states. Potential applications include but are not limited to e-voting systems, identity management and decentralized organization, and various forms of fundraising (e.g., initial coin offerings).</p>

        <p>Multiphoton intravital imaging of the BM. We prepared the mouse calvarian BM as described previously <ref type="bibr">(Junt et al., 2007)</ref>. We used a BioTech TriMScope system (LaVision BioTec) and Ti: Sa laser (MaiTai) to capture images through a 20× water immersion objective lens (NA = 0.95; Olympus). Images were acquired with ImSpectorPro (LaVision BioTec). For three-dimensional (3D) acquisition, the stacks were acquired at a 920-nm wavelength at vertical spacing of 2-3 µm to cover an axial depth of 30-100 µm (for YFP or EGFP). Subsequently, the same stacks were acquired at a wavelength of 800 nm (for TRITC-dextran). The distances between MKs and vasculatures were measured in the reconstructed 3D structure using <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3501353-software-3">Volocity</rs> software (<rs corresp="#PMC3501353-software-3" type="creator">PerkinElmer</rs>). If MKs were outside the vessels, the closest distance from MKs to vessels was measured and represented as negative values. If MKs were in direct physical contact with the vessels, the distance was regarded as (R&amp;D Systems). To block S1pr1 in vivo, we treated C57BL6/J or CD1 mice with W146 (3 mg/kg body weight i.p.) or vehicle every 6 h and measured platelet counts in these mice 24 h later.</p>
        <p>Immunostaining. Anti-mouse S1pr1 (Zytomed), anti-human S1PR1 (ABR), anti-S1pr2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-S1pr4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), antitubulin (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-mouse CD41 (BD), and anti-CD42c (Emfret Analytics) antibodies were used for immunostaining. The samples were examined using Leica microscopy equipped with 40× objective lens (NA = 0.7) or 20× objective lens (NA = 0.5) and commercial charge-coupled device camera (AxioCam; Carl Zeiss). Images were acquired by <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3501353-software-0">AxioVision</rs> software (<rs corresp="#PMC3501353-software-0" type="creator">Carl Zeiss</rs>). For quantification of MK number and size in BM, we counted the total number of MKs in five randomly selected 20× microscopic fields, and the area of MK cell body was analyzed by <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3501353-software-1">ImageJ</rs> software (<rs corresp="#PMC3501353-software-1" type="creator">National Institutes of Health</rs>). S1P level measurement. Levels of S1P were determined by highperformance liquid chromatography with mass detection as described previously <ref type="bibr">(Berdyshev et al., 2005)</ref>.</p>
        <p>Quantitative RT-PCR. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the MaximaTM SYBR Green PCR Master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturers' instructions. The data were normalized to the mRNA level of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh or GAPDH). Primers are listed in <ref type="table">Table S1.</ref> MK culture. Mouse embryonic day (E) 12.5-14.5 FL cells were cultivated in TPO-containing medium for differentiation into MKs <ref type="bibr">(Lecine et al., 1998)</ref>. In brief, mouse FLs were isolated from E12.5-14.5 embryos and kept in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% charcoal-treated FBS (PAN) in the presence of hTPO (ImmunoTools) in a humidified 5% CO 2 /95% air incubator at 37°C. For isolation of immature MKs, E12.5-14.5 FL cells were cultured in medium for 12 h and then incubated with FITC-CD41 (BD) and PE-CD34 (BioLegend) antibodies. Immature MKs were identified as a CD41/CD34 double-positive population and enriched by using a FACSAria cell sorter (BD). Mature MKs were enriched by BSA gradient, as described previously <ref type="bibr">(Pang et al., 2006)</ref>. In brief, the BSA step gradient was prepared by placing PBS containing 1.5% BSA on top of PBS with 3% BSA (PAA). Cells were loaded on top of the gradient, and MKs were settled to the bottom within 30 min at 1× gravity at room temperature. Mature MKs formed a pellet at the bottom of the tube. We distinguished and scored PPs according to the criteria mentioned previously <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al., 2007)</ref>. To inhibit the activity of Rac GTPases, we cultured MKs in the presence of 50 µM NSC23766 (Tocris Bioscience) for 3 d and then scored MKs carrying PPs. To establish a stable gradient during the slow process of PPF, we applied chemotaxis -slides (ibidi), which consist of two large reservoirs with different chemoattractant concentrations and a thin (1 mm) slit between these two reservoirs. A linear and stable chemoattractant gradient is established in the slit by diffusion <ref type="bibr">(Zengel et al., 2011)</ref>. MKs were resuspended in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of 1 µM VPC23019 (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) and loaded onto chemotaxis -slides coated with poly-l-lysine between two large reservoirs. 10 µM S1P or vehicle was applied into one of the reservoirs of the -slides. MKs were cultivated for 10 h at 37°C, and polarization of PPF was evaluated based on the images captured using an Axiovert microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with 20× objective lens (Nikon) and <rs type="software">AxioVision</rs> software.</p>

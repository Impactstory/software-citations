            <p>Electronic Health Records (EHR) represent the central pillar of eHealth strategies worldwide, since they offer the capacity to support patient care, quality improvement, population health surveillance and research. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Until recently the topics of EHR and 'Consumer Health Informatics' tended to be considered separately; discussions of the former being mainly centred on healthcare institutions. Across North America and Europe there has been a gradual realization of the synergies between these two areas, manifested in the growing attention that is being paid to Personal Health Records (PHR) in both the scientific and policy literatures. The PHR is a complex construct and many have bemoaned the lack of consensus on its precise definition. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The central feature is a patient-accessible Electronic Health Record, although models vary in the source and controller of the information (healthcare provider or patient; single or multiple providers), the medium (e.g. web, kiosk, USB) and the additional functionalities associated with the software (e.g. education, prescription reordering, provider messaging, decision support). <ref type="bibr">4,5</ref> This report is concerned with one particular aspect of the PHR concept, namely online access by patients to provider-generated information that is specific to their health history and current conditions, and held in the computer systems of primary healthcare centres. We refer to this as Record Access, in line with the language adopted in recent guidelines from the Royal College of General Practitioners, <ref type="bibr">6</ref> although similar applications have also been characterised as 'tethered Personal Health Records'. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The idea of patients accessing their own health records is not a new one. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> However, the accessibility afforded by the Internet, and the capacity of emerging PHR to integrate personal health applications with provider-owned record systems, creates interesting new challenges and research questions.</p>
            <p>ii Reflecting this history, the origins of the PHR movement in the UK lie with a small number of enthusiastic GPs who pioneered record sharing with patients using computer printouts and portable downloads, latterly partnering with GP systems suppliers to provide waiting-room kiosks and online portals. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> This has yielded favourable user responses and positive impacts on knowledge, mutual trust and record accuracy, despite some concerns over security and confidentiality <ref type="bibr">11,12,13</ref> This ground-up approach sits in stark contrast to the top-down one used to introduce patient access to the NHS Summary Care Record via '<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="b5468afb2a-software-simple-0">HealthSpace</rs>', which has so far met with limited success. <ref type="bibr">14</ref> Despite the enthusiastic response of early adopters, Record Access services remain uncommon in UK primary care and, given the caveats around privacy and liability indicated in the RCGP guidelines, more evidence is needed if they are to i This term has been used to describe emerging systems that offer Record Access as part of a broader suite of online consumer tools for administrative tasks such as appointment booking. ii The UK has a single National Health Service in which the GP acts as the first point of care, the conduit to specialist services and the coordinator of community-based follow-up. As a result they generally receive core documentation pertaining to their patients from other parts of the service, although more detailed records will remain with the specialist host. become mainstream. Questions also remain about the feasibility of integrating Record Access into professional workflow in light of the potential administrative requirements. This study aimed to examine how practices had integrated record access during the course of a one year pilot, and to identity human, organizational or technical barriers warranting attention prior to wider rollout. It also sought to explore whether some of the benefits demonstrated in US studies of PHR, such as improved provider-patient relationships, patient self-care and reduced consulting time, <ref type="bibr">15</ref> were also being felt in British health centres adopting record access.</p>

            <p>In the developing nervous system, Reelin is produced mainly by Cajal-Retzius neurons in the cortex, where it instructs newly born neurons to assume their position and orientation <ref type="bibr">(D'Arcangelo et al., 1995; Tissir and Goffinet, 2003)</ref>. During this process, the neurons are intimately apposed to radial glial cells that form a scaffold along which the neuroblasts migrate, and both cell types rely on Reelin signaling to direct correct patterning of the cortex <ref type="bibr">(Hartfuss et al., 2003; Tissir and Goffinet, 2003; Keilani and Sugaya, 2008; Zhao and Frotscher, 2010)</ref>. In the lymphatic system, we found that Reelin was produced exclusively by ECs, while its release and proteolytic processing was stimulated by the adjacent SMCs. This suggests a mechanism by which Reelin signaling is activated via communication of the two cell types that form the collecting vessels. We further found that LECs, in turn, respond to Reelin by upregulating the expression of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1), a factor known to promote SMC migration and proliferation <ref type="bibr">(Religa et al., 2005; Ma et al., 2008; Aplin et al., 2010)</ref>. This suggests an autocrine function of Reelin in the LECs in controlling the expression of factors involved in SMC recruitment. Interestingly, although the canonical Reelin receptors VLDLR and ApoER2 were expressed in the lymphatic vasculature, Apoer2;Vldlr double mutant mice did not recapitulate the phenotype observed in Reln-deficient lymphatic vessels.littermate controls (n = 3 per each genotype, two vessels per mouse). The images were aligned and processed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="b74d247782-software-5">Photoshop</rs> <rs corresp="#b74d247782-software-5" resp="#curator" type="version">CS4 or CS5</rs> (<rs corresp="#b74d247782-software-5" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Adobe</rs>). Thresholding and quantification of the whole-vessel images were performed using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b74d247782-software-6">MetaMorph Imaging</rs> software (<rs corresp="#b74d247782-software-6" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Molecular Devices</rs>). An inclusive threshold was applied to the &#57441;-SMA channel so that the background was captured by, while all SMC were excluded from, the threshold. The length of the vessel was measured and divided into quarters. A region was drawn around each vessel segment, excluding overlapping blood vessels. The SMC coverage was calculated and subtracted from 100%. A similar thresholding technique was used to quantify the percentage of LVYE-1 immunofluorescence. The line tool in <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b74d247782-software-simple-5">MetaMorph</rs> was used to measure the width of the widest and narrowest vessel points.</p>
            <p>For qualitative analysis of lymphatic vessel function, FITC-dextran (8 mg/ml in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) was injected intradermally into the ears of anaesthetized mice and analyzed by confocal microscopy. For quantitative analysis, 2 &#181;l of ICG dye (1% in dH 2 O; Sigma-Aldrich) was injected into the footpads of anaesthetized mice inside the IVIS Spectrum Whole Body Imaging System (Caliper Life Sciences). Image acquisition and analysis was performed with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="b74d247782-software-7">Living Image</rs> <rs corresp="#b74d247782-software-7" resp="#annotator12" type="version">3</rs> software (<rs corresp="#b74d247782-software-7" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Caliper Life Sciences</rs>) using the following parameters: field of view 6.6, binning 8, and F-stop 2. 70 images were taken with a 2-s exposure time and no delay between acquisitions, which resulted in an image every 3-4 s. The efficiency of the fluorescent signal was measured in a region of interest (ROI) created around a small area of the lymphatic vessel above the knee. The mean efficiency against time was plotted using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="b74d247782-software-8">Prism</rs> <rs corresp="#b74d247782-software-8" resp="#annotator12" type="version">5</rs> software, using 4 s as an interval. For the quantitative Evans blue assay, 2 &#181;l Evan's blue dye (2%; Sigma-Aldrich) was injected into the hind limb footpad. After 5 min, the mice were sacrificed and inguinal lymph nodes were dissected. Both inguinal lymph nodes were weighed together and a mean value was used to calculate dye content in each of them separately. Each lymph node was placed in 5 &#181;l formamide at 60&#176;C for 24 h, followed by an absorbance reading at 620 nm. Evans blue concentration was calculated using a standard curve and presented as dye content per gram of tissue.</p>
            <p>To identify lymphatic-specific ECM molecules, mesenteric arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels were dissected from P7 wild-type (C57BL/6J) pups. Samples from nine animals (in two litters) were pooled. Total RNA was extracted and RNase-treated using an RNeasy Micro kit (QIAGEN) as per the manufacturer's instructions. 100 ng of RNA from two independent samples of each vessel was amplified using WT-Ovation Pico RNA Amplification System (NuGEN) and used for expression profiling using the Mouse exon 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The array data were processed using robust multiarray analysis <ref type="bibr">(Irizarry et al., 2003)</ref> to generate gene-level signal estimates for core level probe sets. The arrays were normalized using quantile normalization and antigenomic probes used to model the background. Quantification was run using apt-1.10.0 from Affymetrix. Before statistical analysis, all Affymetrix control probe sets were removed. Gene changes were selected using a linear model where the standard errors were corrected using empirical Bayes shrinkage (fdr &lt; 0.05). To identify lymphatic-specific transcriptional changes, we applied a nestedF procedure across the three contrasts, selecting genes significant in only the lymphatic groups (fdr &lt; 0.05).

All confocal images, except <ref type="figure">Fig. S1 (G and H)</ref>, represent maximum projection images of confocal z stacks. For visualization of collecting vessels from the proximal to distal end of the ear, images were captured along the length of three randomly chosen collecting lymphatic vessels from Reln &#57394;/&#57394; (n = 5) and wild-type (n = 4) mice. The same analysis was performed for Apoer2 &#57394;/&#57394; ;Vldlr &#57394;/&#57394; , Dab1 Scm , and their respective Transwell migration assay Migration assay was performed using 6.5-mm Transwell with 8 &#181;m polycarbonate membrane inserts (Corning) in a 24-well plate. The lower face of the membrane was coated with 1 &#181;g/ml fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich) before use. Confluent HUVSMC were serum-deprived in SMC growth medium containing 0.2% BSA for 22 h. 1 &#215; 10 5 cells were seeded in the upper chamber and allowed to migrate toward EC growth medium (control) or conditioned medium collected from LECs over a 48-h period, full-length Reelin supernatant from HEK 293 cells (diluted 1:20), control supernatant (diluted 1:20), 10 ng/ml MCP-1 (R&amp;D Systems), or 3 ng/ml PDGF-BB (R&amp;D Systems) over a 23-h period. Reelin function was inhibited using blocking antibody against Reelin (CR-50, 50 &#181;g/ml; MBL). Cells on the upper face of the membrane were removed and migrated cells on the lower face were fixed and stained with 0.5% crystal violet solution in 25% methanol.

Indeed, any process X t satisfying equation (1) under the I(1,r 0 ) conditions with r 0 = 1 and = (1, 0,&#8230;, 0) can be suitably linearly transformed into the new process X * t such that * X * t &#8764; I (0) with * := (1, 0,&#8230;, 0) . The likelihood ratio test is invariant to such rotation. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The matrix has been obtained using the following spectral decomposition: = GDG , where the diagonal elements of D are generated randomly from a truncated standard normal and the elements of G are generated randomly using the standard normal distribution and such that GG = I p .

In particular, to evaluate the impact of the dimension of the conditioning variable vector Z t on the ability of the information criteria to determine the true co-integration rank, we consider the partition X t = (Y t , Z t ), where the dimension of Y t ranges from two to four, i.e. p Y = 2, 3 and 4, which implies a dimension for Z t of p Z = 5, 4 and 3, respectively.

Briefly, single cell suspension has obtained from parent and spheroid cells have plated at concentration of 1000, 100, 10 cells and 1 cell per well in 0.2 ml of CSC medium in 96-well ultra-low attachment (Getbiofil, UK) and cultured for 7 days in a humidified incubator at 37&#176;C and 5% CO 2 . The number of wells containing of colonospheres has counted after 7 days.

The unpaired t-test has used to analyze the median value of expression between the groups. Statistical significance has determined at P &lt; 0.05. All tests have performed in triplicate.</p>
            <p>In this study, we have found that human HT-29 colonic adenocarcinoma cells could form spheroid colonies in a serum-free medium containing. To investigate the capability of colon spheres differentiation, these cells have cultivated in 10% FBS medium rather than EGF and FGF-2. In present serum, spherical undifferentiated cells have attached to the plate, and differentiated into adherent cells with epithelial cell morphology <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). In serum free condition, the expression levels of EpCAM and CD44 were significantly higher in spheroid than parent cells (P &lt; 0.001) <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>). The results have demonstrated that 92.3 &#177; 3.6% of these tumor spheroid cells were CD44+/EpCAM+, while parent cells only have expressed 38.4 &#177; 1.6% of CD44+/EpCAM+ markers. We have measured ALDH1 activity in colonospheres and parent cells-derived colonic HT-29 cell line. Interestingly, we have found that HT29 cells have exhibited substantially high levels of ALDH activity in the parent fractions in compared with the spheroid fractions. ALDH activity was 16.9 &#177; 1.2 in spheroid cells in comparison with 34.6 &#177; 2.3 in parental cells (P &lt; 0.05) <ref type="figure">(Figure 3)</ref>.

The results have indicated that the frequency of spheroid formation in cell line -derived colonospheres were 6.4 fold higher than -derived the parent cells (P &lt; 0.005) <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). The findings have suggested that colonospheres have formed by the colon cancer cell have enriched population of CSCs.</p>

Thus, it has suggested under extreme limited dilution and in serum-free conditions, spheroids could only formed from stem-like cells. Consequently, the formation of colonospheres with a very small number of HT-29 cell line has demonstrated enrichment CSCs in colonospheres <ref type="bibr">(2, 7, 20)</ref>.</p>

            <p>What remains now is to estimate the within-submarket spatial weight v 0 . Since dwellings within a submarket are in general located closer to each other than those across different submarkets, it is expected that v 0 will be large compared to the cross-submarket spatial weights. We propose maximum likelihood to conduct this estimation. Specifically, for any candidate value of v 0 , we construct the corresponding row-standardized spatial weights matrix W, estimate the spatial error model using maximum likelihood, and evaluate the value of the maximized likelihood. In this way, we construct spatial weights matrices using various candidate values for v 0 , estimate the corresponding spatial error models by maximum likelihood using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a70423884d-software-4">Geoda</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Anselin, 2005)</ref>, and maximize the likelihood over all such candidate values. Standard errors are estimated by numerical approximation to compute the Fisher information at this maximized value for v 0 . 14 Finally, as discussed earlier, we use the <ref type="bibr">Born &amp; Breitung (2011)</ref> regression test to examine the validity of spatial error dependence against a hybrid model including a spatial lag.</p>
            <p>Next, we used the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a70423884d-software-5">GEODA</rs> software <ref type="bibr">(Anselin, 2005; Anselin et al., 2006)</ref> to perform a series of Lagrange Multipliers (LM) tests <ref type="bibr">(Anselin, 2005)</ref> for both spatial lag dependence and spatial error dependence. Specifically, in addition to OLS, we estimated by maximum likelihood (ML) alternative spatial regression models and investigated whether a spatial error or a spatial lag model, or indeed a model <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Moran scatter plot for residuals (contiguity weight matrix). Source: Results were produced using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a70423884d-software-6">GEODA</rs> software <ref type="bibr">(Anselin, 2005)</ref>. without spatial effects, best fit the data. We report the results for a spatial weights matrix based on rook and queen contiguity in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>; results for other specifications of spatial weights are similar. Like Moran's I statistics, we find no evidence of spatial dependence. This is despite the fact that we have not accounted for spatial heterogeneity in these estimates*a feature that can contribute to spatial dependence. The Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test statistics are significant neither for the spatial error (p-value 0.41) nor the spatial lag (p-value 0.77) models. The null hypothesis of both tests, which is the lack of spatial dependence, cannot be rejected at the 5% significance level.</p>

Analyses were run as described (Mellanby and others 2013) using the results for 15 microsatellite markers, and both South African dogs and the UK dogs previously reported by Mellanby and others <ref type="formula">(2013)</ref> were included. <ref type="figure">Fig 1</ref> shows the outcome of this analysis when K (number of contributing subpopulations) was set at 6. The result was the same with higher values of K. This analysis showed that within a breed the dogs were genetically very similar regardless of the country. Jack Russell terriers showed equal contributions from different subpopulations, whereas labrador retrievers and German shepherd dogs each showed 90 per cent contribution from a single subpopulation. Jack Russell terriers had very little contribution from either of the subpopulations predominant in the labrador retrievers or German shepherd dogs, as might be expected given the very different phenotype and ancestry of these dogs. The admixture of subpopulations within a breed was the same regardless of country, showing that the breeds have not diverged greatly. To further test this, each breed was subjected individually to <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a628056558-software-simple-0">STRUCTURE</rs> analysis. There was no evidence of stratification based on country of origin at K=2 or higher K values <ref type="figure">(Fig 2)</ref>. As previously reported (Mellanby and others 2013), misclassification of dog breed was common with four of the South African labrador retrievers and one of the German shepherd dogs showing mixed breed ancestry, whereas several others had a 50 per cent contribution from one subpopulation suggesting a one parent of the associated breed and one of another breed or mixed breed background. FIG 1: <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a628056558-software-simple-1">STRUCTURE</rs> analysis of three dog breeds from the UK and South Africa. Genotypes for 15 microsatellites for dogs of all three breeds from South Africa and the UK were entered into the program <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a628056558-software-simple-2">STRUCTURE</rs> and the analysis run with a burn-in period of 100,000 replications and a run of 500,000 replications <ref type="bibr">(Mellanby and others 2013)</ref>. Runs were repeated between two and five times for each value of K to assess the stability of the population structure detected. The results are shown for a typical run with K=6. Each vertical column represents a different dog, whereas the shades of grey represent six different subpopulations in the admixture. The y axis shows the proportional of the genotype attributed to each subpopulation for each dogThis analysis shows that the assignment of dogs to pedigree classes on the basis of genotype is robust across the two countries and there is little evidence for genetic drift within breeds, reflecting the similarity of the breed standards between the two countries. This may be maintained by the import of dogs from other countries and the exchange of semen for artificial insemination. Artificial insemination from cryopreserved domestic dog semen has been available since the 1960s <ref type="bibr">(Thomassen and Farstad 2009</ref>) and use of artificial insemination has increased among pedigree dog breeders as technologies have developed to preserve and transport semen. Although this could benefit the breed and enhance genetic diversity by varying the sires used by a breeder, it is also seen as a cost-effective method to maximise the number of progeny of popular sires <ref type="bibr">(Thomassen and Farstad 2009)</ref>, hence restricting the gene pool. Worldwide use of semen from a small number of sires may have the effect of maintaining the homogeneity of the breed across geographically separated regions. The heterozygosity of the Jack Russell has been maintained in South Africa, indicating that registration as a breed and the need to conform to breed standard has not reduced genetic diversity at this point.</p>

            <p>Behavioural analysis. Behavioural analysis was performed to assess the development of tactile allodynia in mice. Tactile allodynia was measured using a von Frey filament (North Coast Medical, Gilroy, CA, USA). Mice were placed in glass cages with a wire mesh bottom and allowed to habituate for at least 1 h. A von Frey filament with bending forces of 0.16 g (innocuous stimulation) was pressed perpendicularly against the plantar skin of a hind-paw. The paw withdrawal responses to the mechanical stimulus were evaluated by scoring as follows: 0, no response; 1, lifting the hind-paw within 3 s; 2, lifting the hind-paw over 3 s; and 3, immediate flinching or licking of the hind-paw. The stimulation of the same intensity was applied seven times to each hind-paw at several seconds intervals and the total served as the pain-related score (score) in the SNL model. The behavioural data were analyzed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="a4b9899206-software-0">Origin</rs> (<rs corresp="#a4b9899206-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Microcal software Inc</rs>., Sunnyvale, MA, USA) software to determine the IC 50 values.</p>
            <p>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from substantia gelatinosa neurons. The substantia gelatinosa was easily discernible with transmitted illumination as a relatively translucent band across the dorsal horn in the transverse or parasagittal slice preparations. Blind whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were made from SG neurons, as previously described. <ref type="bibr">53,54</ref> The patch pipettes were filled with potassium gluconate solution, a solution containing (in mM); 135 K-gluconate, 5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl 2 , 2 MgCl 2 , 5 EGTA, 5 HEPES, and 5 ATP-Mg (pH 7.2). The tip resistance of the patch pipettes was 6-12 MO. Series resistance was assessed from current in response to a 5-mV hyperpolarizing step. Series resistance was monitored during the recording session and data were rejected if its value changed by 415%. Ion currents were monitored with a patchclamp amplifier (Axopatch 700A, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The data were digitized with an analog-to-digital converter (Digidata 1321A, Molecular Devices), stored on a personal computer using a data acquisition program (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="a4b9899206-software-1">Clampex</rs> version <rs corresp="#a4b9899206-software-1" resp="#annotator4" type="version">10</rs>, <rs corresp="#a4b9899206-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Molecular Devices</rs>) and analyzed using a software package<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="a4b9899206-software-2">Clampfit</rs> version <rs corresp="#a4b9899206-software-2" resp="#annotator4" type="version">10</rs> (<rs corresp="#a4b9899206-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Molecular Devices</rs>).

            <p>Analysis was performed using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a390909d47-software-0">NONMEM</rs> (v <rs corresp="#a390909d47-software-0" resp="#annotator2" type="version">7.2.0</rs>, <rs corresp="#a390909d47-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">ICON Development Solutions</rs>, MD, USA). The different tissues (tear, naso-lacrymal duct, cornea, aqueous humor) were considered as different compartments. Because of its physiology, each eye was considered as an individual <ref type="bibr">[8, 9]</ref>. So, a total of 84 individuals were considered in the dataset.</p>
            <p>In addition to the global multi-compartmental structure, many model configurations were tested, e.g., first-order rate constant or inter-compartmental clearance between the different compartments, a drug cleared or not from the naso-lacrymal duct, a drug cleared or not from the cornea, either fixed volumes of distribution at known physiological values to avoid an over-parameterization of the model or let free to be estimated by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a390909d47-software-simple-3">NONMEM</rs>. Regarding the nanosuspension formulation, two kinetics of administration situations were tested for nanosuspensions (1) administration with zero-order kinetic in the tear, in this case it would allow estimating the duration of the nanosuspension dissolution in the tear or (2) administration as a bolus as it was done for the solution. In the last case, the only way to take into account the formulation was to test it as a binary covariate on the relevant model parameters. The estimation of inter-individual variability (g) was evaluated using either a constant coefficient variation (CV) or proportional error model. The full non diagonal matrix (x-block) and the different combinations of g correlations were evaluated as well as the possibility to fix some x 2 to zero. The selection of a x-block, if any, was made on the basis of the objective function value (OFV) decrease. Many algorithms were tested only one by one or by a combination. Given the complexity of the current model and the multi-compartmental structure, several differential equation solvers were evaluated. The model selection was performed on the basis of the knowledge of the eye structure, the minimization status (i.e., successful), the covariance phase (i.e., completed without any warning message), the absence of any correlation between parameter estimates larger than 0.95, the examination of standard error of the parameter estimates (i.e., B50 %), significant digit of the final parameter estimates (i.e., 3.0). The best pharmacostatistical model was selected based on the lowest OFV and the inspection of goodness of fits, i.e., population and individual weighted residuals (CWRES and IWRES), observed tissue concentrations (DV, for dependent variable) plots versus population and individual predicted concentrations (PRED and IPRED).</p>

            <p>Genomic reads were initially mapped to the reference genome using a fast algorithm. These initial mappings were both expanded and refined by a form of local de novo assembly in all regions of the genome that appeared to contain variations based on these initial mappings. The de novo assembly fully leverages mate-pair information, allowing reads to be recruited into variants with higher sensitivity than genome-wide mapping methods alone typically provide. Assemblies were diploid, and sequencing produced two separate result sequences for each locus in diploid regions. Variants were called by independently comparing each of the diploid assemblies to the reference. The original computational methods for small variant detection are available at: http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/ full/10.1089/cmb.2011.0201. These methods have evolved over the development of further <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a9d1eb8edf-software-simple-0">Analysis Pipeline</rs> versions.</p>
            <p>Predicted single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were compared using National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) dbSNP version 137 to annotate known SNP information. Each SNP was mapped on the genomic features of the UCSC gene table, such as coding region, untranslational region, and intron. Non-synonymous SNP information was extracted by comparing UCSC reference gene information (http://genome.Ucsc.edu/). Information on cancer-related mutations was obtained from the cosmic cancer information database (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/ cancergenome/projects/cosmic/). The Ingenuity <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a9d1eb8edf-software-2">Molecule Annotation System (MAS)</rs> (<rs corresp="#a9d1eb8edf-software-2" resp="#curator" type="url">http://bioinfo.capitalbio.com/ mas3</rs>/) was used for functional interaction analysis of the genes affected. The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a9d1eb8edf-software-simple-3">MAS</rs> is a whole data-mining and function annotation solution used to extract and analyze biological molecule relationships from a public knowledge base of biological molecules and signification.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a9d1eb8edf-software-simple-4">MAS</rs> was used to determine and plot the alterations of genes and signaling pathways. Indeed, two genes in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, EGFR and CACNA1C, were found either mutated or amplified in lung adenocarcinoma tissue <ref type="figure">(Fig S2)</ref> and other cancer-related pathways also harbored multiple mutations <ref type="figure">(Fig S3)</ref>. Activation of the MAPK pathway can result in a multitude of physiological effects, including apoptosis, cell proliferation, mitosis, and the transcription of several classes of genes. EGFR was found in telomerase, cellular aging, and immortality pathways and plays a role in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the regulation of cellular apoptosis <ref type="figure">(Fig 4)</ref>.</p>

            <p>Although technology can target the PWD themselves, the vast majority of telemedicine and smart technologies are designed to support family caregivers. Two separate systematic reviews highlight the benefits of web-based caregiver support programs. <ref type="bibr">29</ref> Web-based training and educational programs to support caregivers are readily available. The InternetBased Savvy Caregiver, based on the validated Savvy Caregiver program, <ref type="bibr">30</ref> is an example. It provides an interactive, iterative curriculum that improves knowledge about, and competence for, caregiving. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> A customized computer-telephone integration system, <rs cert="0.4" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="f58780be93-software-simple-0">e-care</rs>, provides a psychoeducational intervention that identifies resources and strategies to enhance safety, communication, selfcare, social support, and management of problem behaviors in the community. <ref type="bibr">31</ref> The system features screen phones with hierarchal menus (text and voice) that enables users to 1) place and receive calls, 2) send and retrieve messages, 3) access a range of information and services, and 4) conference with several people simultaneously. This system was effective in decreasing caregiver burden and depression significantly in depression scores in caregivers with high depression scores at baseline. <ref type="bibr">31</ref> Another type of in-home caregiver support links caregivers with expert guidance for managing challenging care situations using video monitoring. Caregivers are trained to capture behaviors that are a problem via computer video recording, which is then wirelessly uploaded for a team of experts to review and provide feedback. In a pilot study, this system demonstrated improved behavior management and caregiver communication and was reported as easy to use. 32 Support for caregivers can also be provided via web-based video conferencing and/or text-based chat forums. <ref type="bibr">33</ref> There is growing use and acceptance of video conferencing in both the diagnosis and monitoring in geriatric medical <ref type="bibr">34</ref> and geriatric psychiatry care. <ref type="bibr">35-37</ref> Though further large-scale studies are needed, research has established the reliability and validity for neurocognitive testing and neurological examinations via video telemedicine. <ref type="bibr">35,37,38</ref> Video conferencing can also link local primary care professionals to specialists for assessments, enhancing the administration of standardized assessments and examinations. <ref type="bibr">35,36</ref> Telehealth diagnosis and monitoring have been welcomed in remote and rural areas and with Spanishspeaking and Native American populations, as access to specialized services is limited in these underserved areas. <ref type="bibr">39,40</ref></p>

The change in the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="b295ed8028-software-2">NONMEM</rs> objective functionvalue and goodness-of-fit plots were used to guide the model development. One-and two-compartment disposition models with first-order absorption and first-order elimination were evaluated based on the previous knowledge of the pharmacokinetic properties of the compound from a single-dose study. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> IIV was assessed on all structural model parameters, as was interoccasion variability (the occasion variable was derived based on the visit number: it was assumed that concentrations measured at different study visits represented distinct occasions). The pharmacokinetic parameters (k a , volumes, and clearances) were assumed to be log-normally distributed around the population mean, but the random effects to describe both IIV and interoccasion variability were assumed to be distributed with a mean of zero. The effects of covariates (age, BMI, creatinine clearance, sex, FEV 1 % predicted at baseline, and weight) on the pharmacokinetic model were investigated once an adequate structural and stochastic model had been finalized. Age was categorized into three groups: 6-11, 12-17, and &#8805;18 years. Each covariate was tested individually against the key structural model parameters k a , V d /F, and CL/F in a stepwise fashion (forward inclusion). After each step, the strongest covariate relationship was incorporated into the model, and the others sequentially and individually retested, until no further covariates could be added with statistical significance. The inclusion of a covariate term was considered statistically significant if it produced a difference of 3.84 (P = 0.05, given a single degree of freedom) in the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="b295ed8028-software-simple-6">NONMEM</rs> objective function value during the forward inclusion and if it produced an objective function value difference of 6.64 (P = 0.01, given a single degree of freedom) during the backward elimination. A combination of proportional and additive error models was used. The visual predictive check was used to provide an assessment of the model's ability to describe the data and the model's suitability for simulation. For the covariates identified after the stepwise process, 1,000 simulations were performed to evaluate their effect on the drug exposure at steady state using the following metrics: C max and C trough . The sensitivity of each metric to a given covariate was evaluated by simulation using different percentile values of the covariate distribution in the pharmacokinetic population, while keeping values of the other identified covariates in the model fixed at their median values in the pharmacokinetic population. These simulations were undertaken using the population parameter estimates from the final model and the IIV values of pharmacokinetic parameters, and they yielded the metrics of interest and their 95% predictive intervals. Further details of the modeling methods can be found in the Supplementary appendix.</p>

In the first approach, gene models (http:// augustus.gobics.de/predictions/chlamydomonas/augustus.u5.aa) from the Augustus update 5 (Au5) of C. reinhardtii genome assembly version JGI v4.0 were functionally annotated by assigning enzyme classification (EC) terms using  <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="abff41cd16-software-simple-0">BLASTP</rs> results against UniProt (http:// www.uniprot.org/) and AraCyc (http://www.arabidopsis.org/biocyc/) enzyme protein sequences and their EC annotations as the basis. The second approach followed from mapping of Au5 gene models to annotated JGI v3.1 gene models, for which EC terms and Gene Ontology annotation were assigned using a combination of <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="abff41cd16-software-simple-1">BLASTP</rs>,  <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="abff41cd16-software-simple-2">AutoFACT</rs>, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="abff41cd16-software-simple-3">InterProScan</rs>, and  <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="abff41cd16-software-simple-4">PRIAM</rs>. The comprehensive annotation is presented in Supplementary</p>
            <p>ORF amplicons were generated from C. reinhardtii cells by RT-PCR from RNA or PCR from Gateway clones. The Roche 454FLX Titanium sequencing system was used for sequencing of the generated ORF amplicons according to the manufacturer's instructions. The generated data were processed using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="abff41cd16-software-0">GS FLX</rs> data analysis software v<rs corresp="#abff41cd16-software-0" resp="#annotator5" type="version">2.3</rs>. Minimum overlap length of 40 nucleotides and minimum overlap identity of 90% were used to align the sequencing reads against the Au5 reference sequences. ORFs encoding transporter proteins were verified by capillary Sanger sequencing.</p>

            <p>The teaching project based on the learning platform used at the University of Duisburg-Essen, "moodle" (http:// www.moodle.de/), (http://moodle.uni-duisburg-essen.de/ course/category.php?id=101) consists of two parts:</p>
            <p>The first part allows students to reproduce the nuclear medicine seminars, the films used, and useful references and links are provided. In the second part of interested students can participate in a voluntary online-POL seminar and deepen their knowledge. The first part allows students to revise the nuclear medicine seminars by providing the slides, sources and further references. In the second part interested students can participate in a voluntary online POL seminar and deepen their knowledge. This part of the offer was -because it is teaching project -deliberately designed to be passive; except for a forum and feedback tools there are no plans for interactive teaching at this level. The concept plans that moodle pages accompanying the seminar draw attention to the "active offer" (the POL area) and serve as a "lure". Therefore, the method of problem-oriented learning is described at the bottom of the page and the first POL case is made available on this page. Students interested in working on this POL case in a virtual seminar are asked to register by email to receive more information. Once there are at least 4 people interested in working on a POL case, a small group is formed. To conduct a virtual POL seminar, some basic technical knowledge or preparation is required from each participant. Due to the costs, a deliberate decision was made not to use virtual classrooms or a similar platforms. In our context the online communication software <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dd3c46cc39-software-1">Skype</rs> (<rs corresp="#dd3c46cc39-software-1" resp="#curator" type="url">http:// www.skype.com</rs>) and the word processing application <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dd3c46cc39-software-2">Google Docs</rs> (<rs corresp="#dd3c46cc39-software-2" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www.google.com/google-d-s/intl/de/ tour1.html</rs>) were used. Both programs available free of charge and are already used by many people in everyday life. While <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dd3c46cc39-software-simple-4">Skype</rs> provides the basis for the online meetings with conference calls, the application <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dd3c46cc39-software-simple-5">Google Docs</rs> has the advantage that a multitude of documents can be edited by different people, simultaneously or one-at-atime, so simple synchronous and asynchronous online collaboration is possible. For this purpose the tutors create an account and provide login information for the students. The case process is inspired by the classic POL principle, which means the starting point for the students is a real case study from nuclear medicine. To date, three cases have been completed dealing with thyroid diagnosis, oncological positron emission tomography (PET) and myocardial scintigraphy. As an example, the POL module "Energised" on thyroid diagnosis and treatment, including the background information for students and tutors, the intended learning goals and guidelines for online presentation is shown in the appendix . The case is worked upon -following the classical POL model <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref> -in seven steps, which are carried virtually for the most part (online): The steps to clarify basic questions of understanding, defining the problem, the collection of ideas and approaches, the systematic ordering of ideas and approaches are made online in a <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dd3c46cc39-software-simple-6">Skype</rs> conference call under the moderation of a tutor (a specialist in nuclear medicine or a medical physics expert, each with at least 5 years of teaching experience but without dedicated training), which ends in the formulation of learning objectives. Subsequently, students work on their own or in groups to develop the learning content and compile the results in a document (text or slides). In this phase, slated to last up to three weeks maximum, the tutor is available by email or by telephone on weekdays to answer questions and problems and responds to questions/comments within 24 hours. Finally, the synthesis and discussion of the group results on the basis of the documents takes place online as well. A feedback session concludes the case discussion.</p>
            <p>The educational project "Molecular Imaging"" was conducted in summer 2008 for the first time. It was found that the "passive" part of the offer was well received in the last four semesters. A total of 539 students used the slides for revising the seminars. The "active part", which expects a lot of participation from the students, was viewed by 21 students from the 2 nd (n=11), 3 rd (n=8) and 5 th clinical semester (n=2) in five POL groups of 4-5 students each. Except for two students all participants have completed the relevant course. Both drop-outs indicated that the course was too effort-intensive and one student complained that the technical conditions are inadequate. The technical difficulties consisted of initial problems with the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dd3c46cc39-software-simple-7">Skype</rs> conference, causing the start of the first POLevent to be delayed by 30 minutes. Amongst the other 19 participants, the seminars became a very active forum in which the students became increasingly independent. This was reflected, among other things, in the activity of the tutor who only had to intervene in one seminar on myocardial scintigraphy when the group wanted to place its main focus on coronary angiography rather than put nuclear medical diagnostics. Otherwise, the tutor essentially only had to carry out moderating duties. Working through the cases on average took 6 to 7 weeks and in respect to the intended learning goal, the factual results were positive. Due to the (so far) relatively small number of participants, no valid comparison between the "classic face-to-face POL seminars" can be made. From the perspective of the tutors it can be said, however, that both the results of the students' work and the subsequent discussion were at a very high level. The virtual POL seminar had the character of a teaching project, so far with only relatively few participants. Accordingly, our evaluation interest was not only quantitative but also qualitative. The starting point of this approach was the social scientific criticism of the quantitative survey with questionnaires, which allow mathematisation of the results presentation and reproducibility but with results that often remain superficial due to the suppression of factors or that may produce a false picture <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. In the context of a complex teaching-learning situation a of lack of proximity to the problem and a lack of practical relevance can be the result. With a qualitative survey, however, we chose an open results approach, which highlights the teaching-learning situation in its inner argumentative and practical structure. This is important because the views of the relevant stakeholders will be reflected systematically. Against this background, the evaluation of the course was carried out both in a feedback session at the end of the course and via a brief online questionnaire (moodle), in which students graded four aspects of the course (from 1 "very good" to 6 "bad fail"). 17 of the 21 students evaluated the event (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) and gave mostly positive assessments. It is striking that the technical implementation of the course, especially the first POL groups, received the worst assessment which can also be ascribed to initial problems of the tutors. In the feedback session all participants stated that they benefited from the seminar. A virtual seminar was uncharted territory for most participants and this is reflected in statements that the format of the seminar takes some getting used to. There was also consensus that a restriction of communication to the linguistic level is difficult because the nonverbal element is important, particularly in group work. It is therefore not surprising that four of the five small groups met in face-to-face during the working stage to discuss the case. From the perspective of teachers and the clinic too, the seminar was instructive, even labour intensive compared to the classical "chalk and talk" approach, with an average of 11 hours (6 hours in total in the online phase, 3 hours for evaluating the results and feedback to students and 2 hours for tutoring support).</p>

            <p>To investigate the effect of DA-9801 on NGF regulation, we first tested the effect of samples on the induction of NGF <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Effects of DA-9801 on NGF regulation. To determine the effect of DA-9801 on NGF production, rat primary astrocytes were treated with various concentrations of DA-9801. After 24 h, (A) NGF content in the medium was measured using a rat &#946;NGF assay kit. (B) NGF mRNA expression was confirmed via reverse transcription PCR after 2 h of DA-9801 treatment. Also, we measured (C) NGF levels in the sciatic nerves and (D) the plasma of DA-9801-treated db/db mice. To investigate the NGF-mimetic activity of DA-9801, we treated PC12 cells with 125 &#956;g/ml of DA-9801. The neurite outgrowth per cell was observed every other day, and (E) images were taken of randomly selected fields using a camera attached to a microscope at 4 days. (F) The neurite length was determined using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="fb8259bead-software-0">Optimas</rs> <rs corresp="#fb8259bead-software-0" resp="#annotator17" type="version">6.5</rs> program (<rs corresp="#fb8259bead-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Media Cybernetics</rs>, MD, USA). The differentiation of PC12 cells was scored as follows: cells without neurite outgrowth (0); cells bearing neurites as long as one cell diameter (1); cells bearing neurites two times longer in length than their diameter (2); and cells that had synapse-like neurites (4). (G) We also detected Tieg1/Klf10 mRNA by reverse transcription PCR after 6 h of DA-9801 treatment. In this study, 50 ng/ml NGF was used as a positive control. (A) and (F) were expressed as mean &#177; S.D. and ***p&lt;0.001 indicate statistically significant differences from the control group (Student's t-test). (C) and (D) were expressed as mean &#177; S.E.M. Statistical comparisons between different groups were performed using a one-way ANOVA test followed byin primary astrocytes isolated from cerebral cortices of neonatal rats. As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>A, treatment with DA-9801 significantly increased NGF secretion. The contents of NGF in the medium were 31.7 &#177; 5.8 pg/ml in control cells and 319.6 &#177; 2.3 and 609.4 &#177; 57.1 pg/ml in DA-9801-treated cells (100 and 200 mg/ml), respectively. Moreover, DA-9801 increased NGF mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner in rat primary astrocytes <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2B)</ref>. We also measured NGF levels in the sciatic nerves and the plasma of db/db mice treated with DA-9801. Our results showed that NGF levels in the sciatic nerves were increased by oral administration of DA-9801. The NGF content was 6.2 &#177; 0.5 pg/ml in control mice. However, the DA-9801-treated mice secreted 9.9 &#177; 0.3 pg/ml (DA-9801 30 mg/kg) and 11.6 &#177; 1.0 pg/ml of NGF (DA-9801 100 mg/kg), respectively <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2C)</ref>. In the plasma of db/db mice, NGF concentration was also increased by treatment with DA-9801 100 mg/kg <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2D)</ref>. In both the sciatic nerves and the plasma of db/db mice, LA and GABA had no influence on NGF induction. We also evaluated NGF-mimetic activities of DA-9801 using PC12 cells, which respond to NGF by flattening their cell bodies and extending neurite-like processes <ref type="bibr">(Traverse et al., 1992)</ref>. As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>E and F, we confirmed increases in the neurite length after treatment with DA-9801. The response of PC12 cells treated with DA-9801 (125 mg/ml) was similar to that of the cells treated with NGF (50 ng/ml). We also assessed Tieg1/Klf10 mRNA levels in PC12 cells after treatment with DA-9801 for 6 h. Tieg1/Klf10 is an NGF target gene via the TrkA signaling pathway in PC12 cells <ref type="bibr">(Spittau et al., 2010)</ref>. As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>G, DA-9801 increased Tieg1/Klf10 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner.</p>

            <p>The second stage of research occurs in Introduction to Econometrics, usually taken in the junior year. This course convenes in our econometrics lab, which has 28 computers. Enrollments are capped at 22 students per section due to the heavy burden that draft editing imposes on the professor. The course covers standard econometric topics: estimation using OLS, hypothesis testing, serial correlation and time series, as well as introduction to more advanced topics such as panel data, instrumental variables, and logit/probit estimation. Data analysis is conducted with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="fcc1c07d38-software-simple-0">STATA</rs>, which students begin using the second week of class, and the instruction tends to be applied rather than mathematical/algebraic. A required one-hour lab was added 25 years ago to provide extra instruction time to cover research methods. The course also receives extensive support from our library staff who have developed instruction modules and resource guides to assist students with their research.</p>
            <p>We are fortunate to have facilities that support student research. About three decades ago, the department received an NSF grant to build a computer lab, and the college continues to invest in this space with new hardware (28 Macs) and software (<rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="fcc1c07d38-software-simple-1">STATA</rs>). Our introductory and advanced econometrics courses benefit a great deal from the lab, and it is a hub for research activity throughout the year. The walls of the lab are covered with plaques that commemorate research-paper prizes our students have won, and we hope that they inspire the younger students.</p>

            <p>According to the definition, the in-air output factor (Sc) can be written as <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.2; which numerator and denominator are chamber readings (R) for the same number of monitor units (M) in the presence of a build-up cap for a field with dimensions L and L0 (as a reference field e.g. 10&#215;10cm 2 ) at SSD=100cm and collimator opening CL, C0 respectively. For the total scatter factor, measuring at the dmax in water phantom for a specific field (L) to that reference field (L0) for the same number of monitor units (M) <ref type="bibr">(13)</ref>, it would be written as <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.3. To prevent electron contamination of the photon beam, it is recommended that all readings are performed at a depth of d=10 cm and then they are transmitted to the maximum depth using PDD (d) for that field size <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref>. So, the formula in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.4. According to <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>., L, L0 (field size), CL, and C0 (collimator opening) are shown as AB, EF, , and respectively. As can be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, the total scatter factor is obtained by dividing the dosimeter reading which is caused by primary and secondary radiation (S') from two volume VABCD and reference volume VEFGH and then correct for depth d to dmax. The Sp is defined as the ratio of the absorbed dose at the dmax in phantom (water or solid water) Page 3525 for a given field to that in the reference field with the same collimator opening (C0) to eliminate the collimator effect <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref>. Therefore, the formula in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.5. In this study, to maintain the collimator opening for all fields, the phantom surface can be pulled up (for L&lt;L0) or down (for L&gt;L0) <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). For example, for a field smaller than L0, L=AB, it is necessary to pull up phantom surface to J=(L/L0) &#215;SSD to achieve the same collimator opening. However, care must be which the dosimeter reading at J' needs to be corrected for SSD changes using Mayneord Factor. Therefore; we have to perform dosimetry in several SSDs and the main problem is phantom surface collision with Linac head for small fields. On the other hand, according to Eq. 3 and 5, the difference between the Sp and the total scatter factor is the amount of the collimator opening. Therefore, by considering a correction factor (for the effect of collimator) in the total scatter factor (Eq. 4), Sp can be achieved (Eq.5) as <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.6. In <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> with regards to the Pythagorean theorem, the trapezoid ABC"D" and A'B'C'D' are equal; therefore, the Sp is obtained by dividing the dosimeter readings at S' form two volume VA'B'C"D" and reference volume VEFGH. In this method, we propose to apply a factor (&#945;) to correct scatter portion reached to the dosimeter (S') from VABCD to VABC"D". As mentioned in previous studies <ref type="bibr">(15, 16)</ref>, suppose that there is a parallel beam striking the surface of the phantom and consider a reference plane normal to the central axis, placed at depth d=10cm which the origin is on the central axis. Hence, each element (dx.dy) on this plane acts as a source of scattered radiation. The amount of scatter radiation reaching the central axis (dosimeter location, S') is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between surface elements and the origin. Therefore, with taking into account the photon attenuation &#181;, &#945; is defined as <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.7; Where &#181; is energy attenuation coefficient which depends on energy, field size and depth <ref type="bibr">(17, 18)</ref>. Therefore, the formula in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.8. &#945; will be greater or lesser than 1 while phantom surface was pulled up or down respectively. Let us eliminate the small area at the origin of the coordinate with radius &#949; (refers to the ion chamber radius =3mm) to overcome singularity in nominator and denominator in Eq.7 and use polar system <ref type="figure">Figure 3)</ref>. Therefore, the scatter contribution to dosimeter location (S') for a rectangular field with dimensions (2Y &#215; 2X) <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>) is calculated as <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Eq.9. Finally, a general computer program using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="e47e4e7c89-software-0">MATLAB</rs> <rs corresp="#e47e4e7c89-software-0" resp="#annotator3" type="version">7.12.0</rs> software was written to calculate &#945; using the numerical method to solve Eq. 9.</p>

            <p>Apoptosis was detected by Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end-labeling (TUNEL) using the fluorescein-dUTP-in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Diagnostic GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). For TUNEL assay, cells were seeded on microscope cover glasses pre-coated with 0.1% poly-D-lysine [prepared in 100 mM Na 2 B 4 O 7 .10(H 2 O) buffer at pH 8.2], and cultured over-night in the HG-medium. After confirming attachment of cells to the cover slips, medium was changed to LG-medium for over-night starvation. Glucose was added to the starved cells at different concentrations and for different time periods, after which TUNEL was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, and then washed in PBS. Cells were permeabilized in a solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate on ice, washed twice with PBS and incubated with TUNEL reaction mixture for 60 min at 37 &#8226; C in a humidified atmosphere in the dark. Slides were washed twice with PBS, stained with DAPI for nuclei detection, and washed again with PBS. The cover glasses with cells were flapped on glass slides covered with a few drops of mounting media (DakoCytomation), photographed using an upright fluorescence microscope (Axioscop 2, ZEISS), and processed by the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="c324bcb6a5-software-simple-0">Image Pro</rs> software.</p>
            <p>Apoptosis was also detected by PARP cleavage from 116 kDa into 89 kDa fragments using western blot analysis. Since PARP is a nuclear protein, we decided to test its cleavage in nuclear extracts and not in whole-cell extracts to prevent dilution. Nuclear extracts were prepared and collected as described previously <ref type="bibr">(Schreiber et al., 1989)</ref>. Proteins were separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were incubated in 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS for 1 h, and subsequently probed with a primary monoclonal antibody: anti-PARP (SeroTec, UK) that detects the full length as well as the cleaved PARP. HRP-conjugated Donkey-anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., USA) was used as secondary antibody. Bound antibodies were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent-ECL (prepared locally) and visualized by autoradiography. AChE expression was also detected using western blot analysis. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared <ref type="bibr">(Schreiber et al., 1989)</ref>, and separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane as described above. A rabbit anti-human polyclonal AChE antibody, which detects all isoforms of AChE, was used (sc-11409, diluted 1:500 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., USA). A mouse monoclonal antibody anti-&#945;-Tubulin (T6199, diluted 1:4000 from Sigma-aldrich, USA) was used for normalizing cytoplasmic protein loading. HRP-conjugated Donkey-anti-rabbit or anti mouse (1:5000 diluted in 50% glycerol, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., USA) was used as secondary antibody.

            <p>Transcripts and notes of interviews were analysed with the aid of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ff409f9fa5-software-0">ATLAS.ti</rs> (version <rs corresp="#ff409f9fa5-software-0" resp="#annotator2" type="version">4.2</rs>; <rs corresp="#ff409f9fa5-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Scientific Software Development GmbH</rs>, Berlin), a computer software package for qualitative data. The semi-structured interview schedule was employed flexibly and was also grounded in that it was adapted as the study progressed. A preliminary analysis on the first 12 patient interviews was undertaken by the first author (G.D.-W.), who also conducted the interviews. Subsequently, the conceptual framework was expanded in discussion with all the authors of this article. Although the original aim was to describe patient experiences relating to investigation and management of their ataxia, it rapidly became evident as the baseline interviews progressed that most people's contact with health services ended when diagnostic investigations were completed, whether or not an underlying aetiology was found. Accordingly, diagnosis became a focus in the interviews and in the analysis. This article focuses especially on the follow-up data as these experiences are likely to better reflect the current situation for users in services, as opposed to their own historical experiences of health services, which in some cases stretched back several decades. In the results to follow, interview extracts are labelled using two or three fields showing the participant ID, quotation number and (in baseline interviews only) line numbers from the interview transcript (e.g. P14: 6: 74-78 or P37: 12).</p>

            <p>In this study 103 arthritic hips without secondary pathologies undergoing total hip arthroplasty have been considered. Cases with previous surgery of the ipsilateral hip, avascular necrosis, rheumatoid arthritis or other rheumatic diseases, tumors, history of hip disease in childhood or adolescence and peripheral vascular disease have been excluded. No patient was using platelet aggregation inhibitors, coumarin derivate or was subjected to heparin prior to surgery. Anesthesia of patients was performed with lumbar spinal block, using heavy bupivacaine 20 mg and 0.1 mg morphine. Patients were placed in contralateral lateral position to perform a posterior-lateral approach. After opening the fascia lata and muscle and repair of tendons of the external rotator muscles of the hip, articular exposure with the opening of the posterior capsule was performed. The posterior hip dislocation with maximum flexion and internal rotation exposes the femoral head for visualization of the four quadrants (anterior, posterior, superior and inferior). <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>) After completion of the exposure of the joint surface, a puncture was performed in the middle of each quadrant with a 3.2 mm drill with a 10 mm depth lock. The bleeding was observed and qualified by registering it as early bleeding (EB: immediate to 10 seconds), late bleeding (LB: after 10 seconds) or without bleeding (WB). <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>) This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee and the patients signed a Free and Informed Consent form. Among the variables analyzed, gender, age, laterality, body mass index (BMI), degree of osteoarthritis and bleeding according to the quadrant of the femoral head were included.

Differences in transcript levels were considered meaningful if they met the following three criteria: (i) adjusted P values of &#1021;0.05 (ii) absolute fold changes of &#1350;2 and (iii) a probe cross-hybridization index (CHI) of &#1022;90%. One gene (i.e., lmo0263) fulfilled criteria (i) and (ii) but not (iii) (probe CHI was 80%) and therefore was not included in our analyses.</p>

            <p>Biomarkers for gastric cancer diagnostics PGI/PGII ratios in the serum or plasma are indicators of atrophic gastritis, which is linked to elevated risk of gastric cancer. <ref type="bibr">12-15</ref> H. pylori and gastric atrophy have both been identified as etiological factors for gastric cancer. H. pylori was declared as a class I carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 1994. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> Epidemiological surveys support a positive association between H. pylori infection and the development of gastric cancer. <ref type="bibr">17-19</ref> In this study, all patients and health controls had been tested for H. pylori IgG with ELISA kit (Biohit ELISA kit; Biohit, Helsinki, Finland). Intercellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and hemoglobin were also associated with gastric cancer development and metastasis in previous studies. <ref type="bibr">20-26</ref> All antibodies have been validated in ELISA and were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The antigen protein has been validated for ELISA too. We developed all kits for Luminex according to The Luminex Cookbook. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> All nine protein kits were divided into a 5-plex panel and two 2-plex panels with different dilution rates for each patients' samples. All samples were randomly divided into different plates to perform the Luminex test. The random number allocation and grouping was done using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="e640a8dfa4-software-1">STATA</rs> <rs corresp="#e640a8dfa4-software-1" resp="#annotator0" type="version">12</rs> software.</p>
            <p>The raw data of biomarkers from Luminex combined with the H. pylori IgG concentrations were analyzed by comparison between the gastric cancer patients group and the control group using &#967; 2 , the z-statistic, and the Student's t-test. Further, the univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis and correlations between biomarkers were analyzed. The analysis of correlations between biomarkers was performed as well. For the identification of algorithms distinguishing controls from patients with gastric carcinoma, three classification analysis methods -random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression -were performed with the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e640a8dfa4-software-simple-2">R</rs> program package.

This means that the docked ligand must form a coordinated interaction with the heme iron ion from the IDO active site. For the docking, the A chain of 2d0t, which was crystallized as a dimer, was used. The original ligand 4-phenyl-imidazole, the two co-crystallized detergent molecules of 2-[ N -cyclohexylamino]ethane sulfonic acid, and water were removed. The binding site of the original ligand was chosen for the docking. The program defines the open space in the binding pocket with so called alpha spheres that represent available atom positions. Placement was done by the triangle matcher algorithm using standard settings. The triangle matcher algorithm generates poses by aligning triplets of ligand atoms with triplets of alpha spheres to find possible binding orientations of the ligand within the binding site.</p>

            <p>For incident abdominal obesity cases, the time of abdominal obesity occurrence was assumed to be the midpoint between the visit at which abdominal obesity was first diagnosed and the baseline visit (2005). The person years were calculated as the sum of follow-up times from the baseline until an assumed time of abdominal obesity development or until the final examination of each individual. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for incident abdominal obesity comparing the mild and moderate to severe NAFLD categories vs. the normal group. The data were adjusted, first for age alone, then for the multiple covariates. In the multivariate models, we included variables that might confound the relationship between the NAFLD and abdominal obesity, which include: age, baseline WC, total cholesterol, log(hsCRP), HOMA-IR, eGFR, current smoking status, regular exercise, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The change level of WC was calculated by following formula: WC on censoring time -baseline WC. The average change of WC was compared among 3 groups (normal, mild and moderate to severe NAFLD groups) by one-way ANOVA and &#967; 2 -test. P values &lt; 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

            <p>The HRQoL scores that form the raw data for this analysis are rank-order in nature. Means and SDs of the scores were estimated using generalised estimating equations for illustrative purposes only. Physical and mental composite scores were calculated in the modified SF-36 according to the SF-12 scoring guidelines. <ref type="bibr">16 17</ref> Group comparison and covariate effect size calculation, OR (with 95% CIs and p values) were estimated using repeated measures of ordinal logistic regression, with covariates selected for inclusion by backward stepwise regression ( p-value for exclusion 0.22) from maternal age, Hb, ferritin, Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas ( based on the Collector District of residence of mothers), quality of sleep, use and duration of breastfeeding, hospitalisation of the baby, baby gender and mode of delivery. This included randomisation group covariate interactions in the starting model with exclusion of those interactions using the above criteria. When iron status was selected for inclusion in the model, the association between iron status (ferritin) and HRQoL was reported independently of the trial treatment group. p Values were corrected for multiple comparisons where necessary by the Holm method. The effect of intravenous iron versus oral iron on time of cessation of breastfeeding was compared by estimation of the HR with 95% CIs and p values by Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted for covariates selected for inclusion by backward stepwise regression ( p-value for exclusion 0.22). The time to cessation of breast-feeding was taken from the subject's baby growth booklet for all participants. Neonatal growth in the treatment groups was compared by multivariate third-order polynomial regression as an approximation to APEG growth assessment. The iron status variables used in the multivariate regression models were selected by stepwise regression.

            <p>Cells were rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 C. Fixation was performed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. During the last minute, few drops of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS were added to the cells. Afterwards cells were washed three times in PBS with 0.01% Triton X-100 for 3 min at room temperature, followed by 5 min in PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100. Finally, cells were washed with PBS-T (PBS with 0.1% Tween20) twice for 5 min at room temperature and stored at 4 C. All the subsequent steps were carried out at 37 C. Cells were washed in PBS-T three times for 5 min before antibody staining. Afterwards they were incubated with the primary antibody in 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS-T for 1 h in a humidified chamber. Cells were then again washed in PBS-T three times for 3 min and incubated with the suitable secondary antibody in 4% BSA in PBS-T for 1 h. After washing with PBS-T twice for 5 min, the DNA was counterstained with 50 ng/ml of DAPI in PBS-T for 5 min. Slides were rinsed again in PBS-T and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector).

High correlation (r = -0.771) between the strategic and local ow nership is observed as indicated in the table 2, which couldhave been supposed by the authors as the majority of strategic investors in CEE companies are foreign institutions. This high correlation might lead to the multicollinearity problem in the regression, thus, it would be worth to omit one of these variables in the final regression model. Running the regression models shows that the owners hip structure has higher impact on the dividend payout ratio than on the dividend yield: F test (Dp -dependent variable) is 38.19 vs. F test (DY -dependent variable) is 18.54. It should be noted that both of the regressions ap pear to be significant due to the high F test values, despite the fact that adjusted R in the case with the dividend yield regression model is 2.5% and in the case with the dividend payout regression model it is 9.6% <ref type="figure">(Tables 3, 4)</ref>.Dividend payout Ratio <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref>: The regression results provide evidence that there is a significant positive relations hip between the dividend payout ratio and the strategic investors.

            <p>Small villages (having less than 1,000 inhabitants) are merged with adjacent villages that are more similar in terms of adult education and economic status. After merging the small villages, we are left with 90 villages (or clusters) for analysis. GIS of the HDSS generates spatial data: geo-coordinates of each bari (group of households that share a common yard and whose heads are usually related by blood) and land marks (tube-wells, health facilities, schools, markets, mosques and temples) in degree decimal format. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="ba8a29bc3c-software-simple-0">ArcGIS</rs> software is used to create a polygon of each village and to pick the centroid (defined by the centre of gravity). In case of centroidsKulldorff et al. <ref type="bibr">(5, 6)</ref> have extended the spatial scan statistic into a space&#193;time scan statistic to identify spatial and temporal units with high mortality risks. In this study, we used Kulldorff's space&#193;time scan statistic, which takes into consideration spatial and temporal distributions of the population as follows. The window imposed on the HDSS area is cylindrical with a circular geographic base and with height corresponding to time. The centre of the base is one of several possible centroids located throughout the HDSS area and the height reflects any possible time interval. The cylindrical window is then moved in space and time and it allows the centre of the circular geographic base to move across the HDSS villages. For any given position of the centre, the radius of the circular base changes continuously so that it can take any value between zero and an upper limit of 50% of the total population. A village is captured if it lies in the circular base. Therefore, the circular base is able to include a different set of neighbouring villages. This scanning was applied to HDSS data for the time window 1998&#193;2007 to scan for space and time with high mortality rates.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="ba8a29bc3c-software-simple-1">SaTScan</rs> TM option 'purely temporal analysis' showed a significantly higher mortality in 1998&#193;2002 compared to 2003&#193;2007 <ref type="table">(Table 1</ref>). An alternative analysis using Poisson regression showed a highly significant (pB 0.001) linear mortality decline over the full period 1998&#193; 2007.</p>
            <p>Identifying clusters with high mortality risks is a first step in prioritising areas for analysis of cause and planning of remedial actions. Space&#193;time analysis using Kulldorff's method (6) identified two clusters of villages with high mortality risks in 1998&#193;2002. This reveals that mortalitydecline was faster in the high-risk clusters than in the average-risk cluster and achieved equity. A common drawback of Kulldorff's method is that clusters are defined as circles or cylindrical windows with circular base (5, 6). Actual clusters (or villages) are irregular in shape. This feature has some implications for the interpretation of the results. If a village with low mortality is surrounded by villages with high mortality, it is included in the cluster although some characteristics of the village are different from other villages. If clustering of mortality is, say, along the river, then a circular shape is not appropriate to detect it. The first limitation is similar to that of the control trial cohort, and the overall effect on the result would be small. The second limitation can be minimised by viewing an<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="ba8a29bc3c-software-simple-2">ArcGIS</rs> map. Each high-risk cluster comprises a set of adjacent villages. The most likely mortality cluster consists of 22 villages adjacent to each other. They are in close proximity of the big river, the 'Meghna', and are exposed to more natural disasters such as river erosion and monsoon flooding. The secondary cluster consists of 18 villages on the banks of the rivers Gumti and Dhonogoha and in adjacent low-lying areas. These villages are remote &#193; far away from the sub-district town and health facility. What causes difference in mortality between clusters demands in-depth study.</p>

The analysis was run in parallel on the NeSI pan cluster at the University of Auckland.</p>
            <p>Testing for ecological drivers of population structure Only four different genotypes were derived from native fruits and soil, and 21 from vineyard soil (Supplementary S1 and S2). This translates to low statistical power to test how the niche of isolation affects population structure. Despite this, observations of identical genotypes between niches within, but not between, regions are striking. For example, genotypes recovered from native soil and fruit in the Martinborough region (Waiohine Gorge) were identical to spontaneous ferment isolates recovered 20 km away in Martinborough vineyards but were not found in other NZ regions; three of the genotypes isolated from vineyard soil in the Wairau Valley were identical to isolates from spontaneous ferments sourced in the same region, with one of these vineyard soil genotypes being identical to an isolate from the spontaneous ferment from the same vineyard. F ST values between environmental samples (from native soil and fruit and vineyard soil) and spontaneous ferment samples within regions are extremely low (o0.005) and insignificant <ref type="bibr">(P40.33)</ref> with the exception of Martinborough (F ST &#188; 0.046, P &#188; 0.003); however, this F ST value is classed as only representing 'low' differentiation <ref type="bibr">(Wright, 1978)</ref>. There is complete overlap of isolates deriving from all niches in a principal component analysis of genetic distances between genotypes (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref>) and no significant population differentiation between niches within regions using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="a4f4d258e2-software-simple-8">InStruct</rs> and subsequent <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="a4f4d258e2-software-simple-9">ObStruct</rs> analyses (P40.119, <ref type="figure">Supplementary Figure S2)</ref>. Together, this provides no substantial evidence of an effect of niche on population structure within regions. Some of the S. cerevisiae genotypes contributing to spontaneous ferments may have derived from wineries, as opposed to the 'environment' <ref type="bibr">(Bokulich et al., 2013)</ref>. As all of these wineries reside within the same geographic regions the fruit was collected from, these potentially winery derived genotypes form part of the local population we wish to study. Thus, individuals from various niches within regions comprise homogenous populations, and so we combined all genotypes from different niches within regions to form regional populations for further analyses.</p>
            <p>Quantifying geographic population structure <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="a4f4d258e2-software-simple-10">InStruct</rs> analyses <ref type="bibr">(Gao et al., 2007)</ref> indicate the optimal number of populations, given the data are 16. Examination of the ancestry profile plots <ref type="bibr">(Rosenberg, 2004)</ref> resulting from this analysis are indicative of population structure by region to some degree (for example, the blocks of green, red and yellow in Nelson, Central Otago and Martinborough, respectively) and are in agreement with the magnitude of the pairwise F ST estimates <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>). Subsequent <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="a4f4d258e2-software-simple-11">ObStruct</rs> analyses revealed that the inferred population structure is significantly correlated with geographic location (R 2 &#188; 0.16, Po0.0001), and this explains about one-sixth of the genetic variability observed. Individuals from the Nelson and Central Otago regions contributed the greatest signal to overall population structure with significant decreases in the R 2 values observed when these are removed (R 2 &#188; D &#192; 0.05 and D &#192; 0.02, respectively). The R 2 value remained constant when data from Martinborough were removed but increased when Hawke's Bay and Marlborough data were independently removed (R 2 &#188; D &#254; 0.03 for both). Increases in R 2 suggest individuals from these regions add noise to any signal for structure (that is, have homogenised not localised populations). Further, canonical discriminant analysis shows that B80% of the variation in ancestry profiles can be represented with the first and second axes, suggesting that most of the variation can be visualised in these graphical representations of the data (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S3</ref>). Ancestry profiles from Central Otago and Nelson cluster the most discretely in these plots,The number of individuals included in the final analysis after the collapsing of identical individuals because of clonal expansion. b The estimated number of genotypes in the population by rarefaction with 95% upper and lower rarefaction limit calculated using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="a4f4d258e2-software-11">EstimateS</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Colwell, 2006)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Quantifying population connectivity and migration Pairwise estimates of migration between the regions (Nm values) using classic methods derived from F ST values <ref type="bibr">(Hartl and Clark, 1997)</ref> suggest that Hawke's Bay and Marlborough are the most connected, closely followed by Marlborough and Martinborough, and Hawke's Bay and Martinborough <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>). Nelson and Central Otago share the lowest number of migrants with an estimate of just one per generation <ref type="figure">(Figure 1)</ref>. <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="a4f4d258e2-software-simple-13">MIGRATE</rs> analyses showed an acceptance ratio for each parameter ranging from 0.38 to 0.65, and an effective sample size of approximately two million, suggesting that the chain length was sufficient. The autocorrelation between parameters and the prior was high and estimated to be around 0.96 overall, indicating a lack of information in data. This is reflected in the high confidence intervals surrounding the estimates (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table S4)</ref>. However, consistent patterns between multiple runs were evident, allowing meaningful estimates of gene flow between regions to be made. Inferred mean rates of movement between regions span an order of magnitude ranging from 6 to 63 migrants per generation <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref> and Supplementary Table S4), and show differential inward and outward movements for some regions. Correlating with the classic Nm estimates, and the analyses of population structure, Nelson and Central Otago show greatest isolation with twofold greater rates of outward than inward migration, and show an average of just 51 inward migrants per generation, 3.2-fold less than the overall average inward migration rate of 164 migrants per generation for all other regions <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref> and Supplementary Table S4). Conversely, Marlborough and the Hawke's Bay, which harbours some of the least distinctive and most diverse populations, experience some of the greatest inward migration rates at an average of 171 migrants per generation, 1.4-fold more than the average inward migration rate (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table S4</ref>). In line with the low F ST estimates, a high degree of individuals with shared ancestry from <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="a4f4d258e2-software-simple-14">InStruct</rs>, and a large proportion of admixed individuals <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>), Marlborough and the Hawke's Bay are the most connected regions, and experience an average of twofold more migration between these regions than the average overall migration rate. The extent of migration between regions does not correlate with geographic location (P40.21) showing the difference in the extent of gene flow is not simply a function of distance.</p>

            <p>FDG-PET scanning was performed to detect orthotopic tumours. The <ref type="bibr">18</ref> F-FDG was produced and provided by Sk&#229;ne University Hospital Cyclotron Unit. For PET-imaging, mice were intravenously injected with approximately 30 MBq of FDG and were imaged 1 h after administration using a preclinical PET/CT-scanner (Bioscan, USA). Mice were anaesthetised using 2-3% isofluorane and were placed in a temperature regulated animal chamber (Minerve, Bioscan, USA) with the temperature set to 37 C (Minerve multistation controller unit) during the scanning. During the acquisitions, respiration was monitored on PC (SA Instruments, Inc, USA) and anaesthesia levels were adjusted accordingly. CT scanning was performed using the X-ray exposure of 600 ms and 177 lA, and the zoom level set to medium zoom. The CT images were scanned with 180 projections/rotation, pitch 1.0 and a binning of 1:4. The CT reconstruction was performed utilizing a Butterworth filter algorithm. The PET acquisition was performed with the coincidence mode set 1-3. The PET data was acquired in list mode for 30 minutes, and reconstructed dynamically using the OSEM option and rebinning SSRB to 2D LOR with the ring difference set to 8. CT and PET images were evaluated and created using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="c14654bd29-software-0">InVivoScope</rs> software (<rs corresp="#c14654bd29-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">InviCRO</rs>).</p>
            <p>Mice were anaesthetised using 2-3% isofluorane in 200 ml/ min O 2 / 200 ml/min NO 2 . Animals were restrained to an MR bed via head fixation. Breathing was monitored using a pressure sensitive pillow, temperature was monitored using a rectal probe and heating was regulated during MRI data acquisition to keep body temperature at 37 C (SA instruments, Inc, USA). MRI was performed at a field strength of 9.4 T (Agilent Technologies, USA). Respiration triggered fat suppressed fast spin echo images were acquired using a spin echo preparation (10 ms) and an echo spacing of 10 ms (acceleration factor 4, effective echo time: 27 ms, 4 averages). The repetition time was set between 800 and 950 ms depending on the breathing rate of the animal. The acquisition of the data for the 12 slices was spread over 4 respiration phases to achieve a T1-weighting corresponding to a repetition time of about 3.2-3.5 sec. Coronal and sagittal sections were acquired with an in plane resolution of 1563137 lm and a slice thickness of 1 mm, while the transversal direction was acquired with an in plane resolution of 1373137 lm. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="c14654bd29-software-1">ImageJ</rs> <rs corresp="#c14654bd29-software-1" resp="#annotator3" type="version">1.46r</rs> with a plugin provided by Agilent to import their proprietary format FDF images was used to analyse the images.</p>

            <p>Cultured SK-N-BE(2)c cells, fresh tumour explants from SK-N-BE(2)c orthotopic tumours, patient tumours and PDXs were snapfrozen and stored in 280 C freezer for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis. Briefly, DNA was extracted from the cells and tissues using DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the instructions. We used the Affymetrix CytoScan HD platform for SNP array analysis of cultured SK-N-BE(2)c cells, SK-N-BE(2)c tumours, PDXs and patient tumour #3. High resolution microarray analysis was performed by hybridisation of genomic DNA on arrays, using equipment and protocols as recommended by the manufacturer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The Affymetrix CytoScan HD chip contains approximately 2.6 million markers distributed throughout all chromosomes; of these almost 750,000 are SNPs enabling detection of copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity. The practical resolution of the method is 10-50 kb for deletions and 30-150 kb for duplications; depending on the probe density of each segment. HumanCytoSNP-12 DNA Analysis BeadChip (299,140 markers 10 kb average distance) from Illumina (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was used for SNP array analysis of patient tumour #1 and patient tumour #2. DNA amplification, tagging and hybridisation to the chip were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (http:// www.illumina.com). Data were analysed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="c14654bd29-software-5">GenomeStudio Genotyping</rs> Module (<rs corresp="#c14654bd29-software-5" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Illumina</rs>). For exclusion of constitutional copy number polymorphisms, the Database of Genomic Variants (http://projects.tcaq.ca/variation) was used. Genomic position annotations were based on the hg19 build (http:// genome.ucsc.edu/) of the human genome sequence. Copy number variation analyses were performed using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="c14654bd29-software-simple-8">Nexus</rs> software.</p>

The photodiode array (PDA) detector was recorded between 210-450 nm and the monitoring wavelength was set to 330 nm. The Brownlee SPP C18 column (2.1 mm&#215;75 mm i.d., 2.7 mm, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) used was placed in a column oven set at 25&#176;C. The KJ sample was dissolved in 15% acetonitrile to a final concentration of 30 mg/mL, filtered using a 0.2-mm PVDF filter, and then injected into the UPLC system with an injection volume of 1 mL and flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. The mobile phase was composed of a linear gradient of acetonitrile in H2O acidified with acetic acid (0.1%) and run as follows: 2-5% (0-2.5 min), 5-15% (2.5-10 min), 15-20% (10-15 min), 20-50% (15-25 min), 50-100% (25-27 min), 100% (27-37 min), and 100-2% (37-38 min). The operating parameters of the mass spectrometer were set as follows. In the negative ion mode, the needle electrode was set to 2000 V; nitrogen gas was used as the nebulizer and desolvating agent at flow rates of 1 and 3 L/min, respectively; and the desolvating chamber and orifice 1 temperatures were 250 and 80&#176;C, respectively. The atmospheric pressure interface potentials for the orifice 1, ring lens, and orifice 2 were 80, 10, 5 V, respectively. The mass scale calibration was performed using a Yokudelna calibration kit (JEOL) for ensuring accurate mass measurements while the scan range of the MS acquisition was set at m/z 100-2000.</p>

            <p>Analysis of &#946;-glucan synthase gene structure. The exon arrangement of the S. crispa &#946;-glucan synthase gene was analyzed by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="ece74e37d3-software-2">FGENESH</rs> software (<rs corresp="#ece74e37d3-software-2" resp="#curator" type="url">http://linux1.softberry.com</rs>/) <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref> using Coprinopsis cinerea genome as a reference.

Phylogenetic analysis with the fungal &#946;-glucan synthases was conducted using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="ece74e37d3-software-4">MEGA</rs> ver. <rs corresp="#ece74e37d3-software-4" resp="#annotator7" type="version">2.0</rs> software.</p>
            <p>Primary structure of the S. crispa &#946;-glucan synthase gene. The DNA sequence with a size of 5,502 bp for the S. crispa &#946;-glucan synthase gene was determined. Sequence&#946;-Glucan Synthase from Sparassis crispa 169 comparison analysis of multiple fungal &#946;-glucan synthase genes revealed that the determined sequence was incomplete, lacking approximately 400 bp at the 3' end region. The &#946;-glucan synthase gene was analyzed by the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="ece74e37d3-software-simple-6">FGENESH</rs> program to predict the open reading frame using the C. cinerea genome as the reference. As a result, the &#946;-glucan synthase gene was found to consist of 10 exon sequences separated by nine introns. The predicted size of the mRNA was 4,728 bp. The mRNA encoded a polypeptide consisting of 1,576 amino acid residues. Since mushroom &#946;-glucan synthases of this type are generally composed of 1,6401 ,650 amino acid residues, the S. crispa &#946;-glucan synthase in this study is estimated to be devoid of approximately 70 amino acids at its C-terminus. However, the protein regions critical for enzyme function, including the active site, are mostly contained within the 1,500 amino acid residues for fungal &#946;-glucan synthase <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. The amino acid sequence for S. crispa &#946;-glucan synthase is estimated to carry most of the information required for the analysis of enzyme function.</p>
            <p>Fungal &#946;-glucan synthase is an integral membrane protein, consisting of two cytosolic and two transmembrane domains <ref type="bibr">[1, 23]</ref>. Topology of S. crispa &#946;-glucan synthase was analyzed by the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="ece74e37d3-software-simple-7">Phobius</rs> program to predict the functional domain regions. As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>A, S. crispa &#946;-glucan synthase was predicted to consist of 15 loops (L1~L15) and 14 transmembrane &#945;-helices <ref type="figure">(H1~H14)</ref>. Catalytic domains C1 and C2, homologous to Fks1, were found in L1 and L9, respectively. The two domains were separated by the transmembrane domain TM1, which was shown to comprise eight transmembrane &#945;-helices <ref type="figure">(H1~H8)</ref>. TM2, composed of six transmembrane &#945;-helices <ref type="figure">(H7~H14)</ref>, was located at the C-terminus of the protein <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2B)</ref>. The large loop structures L1, L9, and L11 with lengths of 367, 573, and 143 aa, respectively, were located at the cytosolic side of the membrane, implying their function in the synthesis of &#946;-glucan. In the yeast homologue Fks1, the L9 loop was reported to play a critical role in enzyme catalysis <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref>. Mutations in the core catalytic regionof the Fks1 L9 loop, ranging 830~1,050 aa, caused more than 80% reduction in catalytic activity, as shown by the mutant strains fks1-1144 (L872F, E907K, N982S) and fks1-1154 (K877N, A899S, Q977P) <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>. The L9 loop of S. crispa &#946;-glucan synthase was highly homologous to that of Fks1 <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref>. The amino acid residues reported to affect the catalytic activity of Fks1 were well conserved in S. crispa &#946;-glucan synthase <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3</ref>, shaded amino acids).</p>

To compare variables between the two groups, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to identify the variables with a normal distribution. Variables with a normal distribution were compared by independent t-tests. Spinal anesthesia in second trimester and those without a normal distribution were compared by the Mann-Whitney U-test. The number of patients was compared between the groups using the chi-square test. Value comparisons for each measurement were also conducted using repeated measures of ANOVA. All significant results were also analyzed with Tukey's post hoc test to determine whether time points produced values significantly different from baseline values.

            <p>In higher eukaryotes, genes often produce alternatively spliced transcripts (AS transcripts). Many AS events have been actively detected with high-throughput experimental methods, such as RNA-Seq and microarrays <ref type="bibr">(Hallegger et al., 2010)</ref>. However, the functions of putative proteins encoded by AS transcripts (termed 'AS isoforms') have not been experimentally analyzed in many cases. Functional annotation tools for transcripts with novel patterns of splicing are desirable to infer the functional significance of AS isoforms. There are few tools for analyzing AS isoforms translated from novel transcripts queried by users. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-4">AltAnalyze</rs> (<rs corresp="#e9c5a4565d-software-4" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www. altanalyze.org</rs>) identifies AS events using RNA-Seq or microarray data and shows how these events may affect domain composition. However, it does not provide information on the effects of AS on the 3D structures of AS isoforms. MAISTAS <ref type="bibr">(Floris et al., 2011)</ref> assesses whether user-queried AS isoforms are structurally plausible proteins, but explicit functional annotations are not provided.</p>
            <p>First, a genome contig sequence aligned to the query transcript sequence with the largest value of both length coverage and sequence identity is selected using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-2">MEGABLAST</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Altschul et al., 1997</ref>). An alignment of the query transcript and the contig sequence is performed using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-3">SPLIGN</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Kapustin et al., 2008)</ref>. <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-4">AS-EAST</rs> searches the AS-ALPS database for transcripts mapped on the same region of the contig as the query transcript. The user can select one of the transcripts as a reference transcript. Second, the protein-coding sequence (CDS) of the query transcript is predicted by identifying the longest open reading frame (ORF) or FrameDP program <ref type="bibr">(Gouzy et al., 2009)</ref>. Users can also use the ORF starting <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-5">AS-EAST</rs> <ref type="figure">Fig. 1. (a)</ref> User interface for generating query transcript data. As a reference of exon-skipped transcript sequence generation, the mapping results of RNASeq data from <ref type="bibr">Wang et al. (2008)</ref> are shown at the top of the schematic figure in the human dataset. Mapping of the RNA-Seq data was performed using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-6">TopHat</rs> program <ref type="bibr">(Trapnell et al., 2009</ref>) with default parameters. (b) Interaction residues obtained from 3D structure information assigned to a reference isoform. The deletion-type AS region is shown in red. Interaction residues are denoted with arrowheads in the schematic view and stick models in the 3D structure view. The ligand is shown in a space-filling model. The 3D structure is shown with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-9">Jmol</rs> (<rs corresp="#e9c5a4565d-software-9" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www.jmol.org</rs>/) with the users' chosen first codon as the CDS. By comparing the genomic regions corresponding to the CDSs of a reference transcript and the query transcript, <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-9">AS-EAST</rs> identifies CDSs changed through AS (termed 'AS CDSs'). The AS CDSs of a reference transcript that have no corresponding region in the query transcript are classified as deletions, and the AS CDSs of the query transcript that have no corresponding region in a reference transcript are classified as insertions.</p>
            <p>To analyze the functional effect of AS on a putative protein encoded by the query transcript (query isoform), annotations of the query isoform with functional regions are performed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-10">InterProScan</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Zdobnov and Apweiler, 2001)</ref>. From the results of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-11">InterProScan</rs>, functional domains from the Pfam, Gene3D and SUPERFAMILY databases and transmembrane regions predicted with <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-12">TMHMM</rs> are shown in <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-13">AS-EAST</rs>. Moreover, <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-14">AS-EAST</rs> annotates the query isoform using functional amino acid residue information <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1b)</ref>. Amino acid residues interacting with other molecules (interaction residues) are identified from the 3D structure data of protein complexes <ref type="bibr">(Yura et al., 2006)</ref>. <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-15">AS-EAST</rs> assigns 3D structures to the query isoform with BLASTP <ref type="bibr">(Altschul et al., 1997)</ref>. <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-16">AS-EAST</rs> determines whether 3D structures are assigned to AS regions on the basis of the criteria by <ref type="bibr">Yura et al. (2006)</ref>. According to the alignment of the sequences of the reference isoform and the assigned 3D structures, interaction residues are projected to the corresponding residues in the AS regions. In the MAPK1 example, the query isoform has a protein kinase domain, according to the results of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e9c5a4565d-software-simple-17">InterProScan</rs>. However, the query isoform lacks a region that has some residues constituting the ATP-binding pocket and interaction residues and is predicted to lose protein kinase activity. Therefore, the expression of the AS isoform encoded by the fourth exon-skipped transcript in human skeletal muscle might inhibit the MAP kinase signaling pathway and regulate cell proliferation/differentiation as a result.</p>

            <p>For quantitative data evaluation, the median test and Mann-Whitney U-test were used. To objectify if transfusion and mortality were independent of the patient's temperature, age and GCS contingency tables were created and analysed with a &#967; 2 test. To compare means, Student's t test was used. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was applied to identify whether hypothermic and transfused patients had a higher risk of mortality than the other patients in the study. Binary logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for mortality. The univariate predictors were the body temperature and transfusion. The results are given in adjusted OR (AOR) and reached statistical significance with p&lt;0.001. Other results are presented as mean (SD) for ordinal data, and as median for data which had expected peaks and descriptive data as raw percentages.

Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) by using a semidry transfer cell (BioRad, Trans-blot SD), and blocked with 3% nonfat milk in PBS (1X; 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were probed with anti-&#946;-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at a 1:100 dilution, followed by incubation in goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to infrared fluorescent dye (IRD; LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) at 1:10,000 dilution. Blots were scanned using the Odyssey Imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). If reprobing of a blot was desired, the antigen-antibody complex was stripped using a mild stripping solution (0.2 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.2, 0.1% SDS, 0.01% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by 3X washing with PBS-0.1% Tween-20. The membranes were then blocked as described and reprobed with anti-vimentin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at 1:200 dilution, followed by incubation with the secondary antibody as described, and scanning using the Odyssey Imaging system. The pixel intensity of the western blots, normalized to vimentin, was analyzed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="dccd110075-software-simple-0">Image-J</rs> software <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>.

            <p>The mold consisted of a base was scored with 3 horizontal lines perpendicular to 2 vertical lines with each 0.050 mm wide. 3.8 mm internal diameter steel ring was positioned accurately on the base and perforated steel plate was used to apply pressure after loading elastomers. Initially, the metal ring was placed on the base of the mold fallowed by direct injection of light body material onto platform. Then tray material was mixed and loaded according to manufacturer instruction. Excess materials were removed through perforation. The specimens were allowed to set in thermostatically controlled water bath at 37&#176;C to simulate oral condition. Total of 30 specimens with 10 for each group (materials) were fabricated. After fabricating the samples, the distance between the inner profiles of horizontal line was measured (0.005 mm) using microscope before and after subjecting to disinfection with autoclave (Group-1), chemical -1% sodium hypochlorite (Group-2), and microwave (Group-3) methods by same examiner.

            <p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) tests was used to compare variables. All continuous variables are shown as the mean -standard deviation except for ANCOVA analysis (mean -standard error). To compare the relationship among HbA1c, GA and other variables, Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to assess the associations between clinical and laboratory variables. We analyzed the differences in the correlated coefficients between PCGR or HOMA-b and glycemic indices using Steiger's Z-test. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of PCGR was shown, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for separating each medication group.

Empirical therapy with ceftriaxone was initiated after blood culture submission. In spite of the treatment, fever persisted for 3 days and the C-reactive protein level did not decrease. The ceftriaxone treatment was changed to teicoplanin plus piperacillin-tazobactam after isolation of gram-positive coccobacilli from the blood culture. Fever and other symptoms subsided with the new regimen. All subsequent blood cultures were negative, and the patient was discharged on the 9th hospital day with an uneventful recovery.</p>

            <p>TM with a Multimode TM AFM (Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) operation with a Nanoscope IIIa TM controller. For scanning, Olympus silicon cantilevers (OMCL-AC160TS-W2) with spring constants between 36 and 75 N/m were used. The scan frequency was typically 1.5 Hz per line and the modulation amplitude was a few nanometers. Analysis of the DNA-Dan complexes was performed using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="d986798879-software-simple-0">Nanoscope</rs> software. Twodimensional images in brightness and contrast were optimized for the purpose of clarity.

            <p>The procedure for indirect immuno-fluorescence microscopy was essentially the same as previously described <ref type="bibr">(27,28)</ref>. In brief, cells were fixed by treatment with 80% methanol for 1 h at <ref type="bibr">25</ref> C, and deposited on to a poly L-lysine-coated slide. After air drying, cells were treated with 2 mg/ml lysozyme solution at room temperature for 5 min. The slide was treated 99% methanol for 1 min, and then with acetone for 1 min until complete dryness. After washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) and 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 15 min for blocking, the sample was treated with 200-500-fold diluted anti-Dan antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with Tween-containing PBS, the sample was treated at room temperature for 1 h with 500-fold diluted goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated with a fluorescence compound Cy3. After washing with Tween-containing PBS, the sample was treated with 10 ml of DAPI (4 0 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, 10 mg/ml) for 1 min for staining DNA, and covered with one drop of mountain medium (1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine and 90% glycerol in PBS, pH 9.0). The immuno-stained samples were observed with a fluorescence and phasecontrast microscope (100&#194;objective lens; Olympus, Japan) equipped with a chilled, high sensitive digital CCD camera, Regita EXi (NIPPON ROPER, Japan), connected to a computer. Different filter cassettes were used for observation of Cy3 and DAPI fluorescence. The images were transferred directly to a <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d986798879-software-simple-2">Windows XP</rs> and processed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="d986798879-software-2">Image-Pro Plus</rs> version <rs corresp="#d986798879-software-2" resp="#annotator14" type="version">6.0</rs> software.

            <p>Normally distributed data were expressed as mean &#177; standard deviation (SD), and comparisons between groups were performed using a Student's t-test. Abnormally distributed data were expressed as median and interquartile range (M, IQR), and comparisons between groups were performed using a Wilcoxon rank sum test. Categorical variables were presented as numerical data and percentages, statistical comparisons were conducted by a Chi-square (&#967; 2 ) test. In univariate analysis, variables with P &lt; 0.1 between survivals and deaths were considered as potential risk factors for mortality and included into a multivariable logistic regression model for adjustment. After every PLT index had been adjusted by clinical covariates, the ORs for mortality in patients with normal or abnormal PLT indices were presented. Hosmer-Lemeshow test was applied to test Goodness-of-fit properties. Collinearity was determined by variance inflation factor (VIF). The value of VIF more than 5 indicated the existence of multicollinearity. <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref> Second, to explore the relationship between PLT indices and illness severity, we first divided each PLT index into tertiles of the normal range, higher than upper limit, lower than lower limit. Then, we plotted the distribution of APACHE II scores and SOFA scores in each tertile to investigate whether the patients with abnormal PLT indices were associated with higher illness scores. Third, to evaluate the performance of the PLT indices in predicting death events, we built the ROCs for every index and compared the area under the curves (AUC). We also calculated optimal cut-off point (where the Youden index reached the maximum value) <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref> and the diagnostic parameters including sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio and diagnostic accuracy for each PLT index. Finally, to compare the prognosis in patient with normal and abnormal PLT indices, we used the KaplanMeier method to construct survival curves for the each group. Log-rank test was used for comparison of different survival curves between patients with normal and abnormal PLT indices. All the statistical analysis was performed using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="ae251b972b-software-0">Stata</rs> <rs corresp="#ae251b972b-software-0" resp="#annotator5" type="version">10</rs> software (<rs corresp="#ae251b972b-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">StataCorp</rs> LP, College Station, TX, USA), P &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

            <p>Western blot assay. The cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer supplemented with RIPA 10 &#181;l/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), a protease inhibitor, and protein concentrations were determined by a Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) Protein assay kit. All of these reagents were purchased from the Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), which were blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 2 h before being incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4&#730;C. The membranes were subsequently incubated with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. The protein bands were visualized by an Enhanced Chemiluminescence Detection kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and photographed by a Gel Logic 2200 PRO imaging system. The following primary antibodies were used in this experiment: an MTDH rabbit mAbsiRNA interference and stable knockdown cell line establishment. Four siRNA sequences targeting human MTDH mRNA were designed using RNAi designer (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="c16bdb5b4d-software-0">Oligo</rs> <rs corresp="#c16bdb5b4d-software-0" resp="#annotator7" type="version">6.0</rs> software). A scrambled sequence of targeting MTDH sequences was used as a negative control. The control siRNA (MTDH-con si) targeting sequence was 5'-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACG UTT-3', the MTDH-siRNA#1 (si#1) targeting sequence was 5'-GCUGUUCGAACACCUCAAATT-3', the MTDHsiRNA#2 (si#2) targeting sequence was 5'-GCCGUAAUCA ACCCUAUAUTT-3' , and the MTDH-siRNA#3 (si#3) targeting sequence was 5'-GCCAUCUGUAAUCUUAUCATT-3'. The most effective siRNA sequence was selected, after which a hairpin structure (shRNA) was added to it. A recombinant lentivirus containing the corresponding MTDH-shRNA construct was subsequently produced via co-transfection of 293T cells with helper plasmids (psPAX2 and pMD2G) with Lipofier (HanBio, Shanghai, China). After 48 h of transfection, the cultured supernatant was harvested, filtered and concentrated by ultra centrifugation. To establish stable MTDH-knockdown cell lines, we transduced the MKN45 and AGS cell lines with lentiviral RNAi vectors. After 72 h, the cells were treated with 2 &#181;g/ml puromycin. The puromycin-resistant clones were selected and expanded for subsequent experiments.</p>

One-way analysis of variance and Student's t-test wereperformed to determine significance, and Chi-square tests were used to compare clinical characteristics of patients between different groups. Overall survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed by the log-rank test. All the analyses were performed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="c16bdb5b4d-software-1">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#c16bdb5b4d-software-1" resp="#annotator7" type="version">19.0</rs> software and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="c16bdb5b4d-software-2">Prism</rs> statistical program <rs corresp="#c16bdb5b4d-software-2" resp="#annotator7" type="version">5</rs>, and all statistical tests were twosided.

In the first case, no one opposes the establishment of the rule of law, and reform occurs in period 1. In the second case, three-fourths of the agents oppose the rule of law, and reform is delayed on average for 16 periods. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>(b) depicts the growth paths of agents&#213; expected aggregate lifetime income in these two cases. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> Expected aggregate income is 20% lower along the path of delayed reform.

To correct for multiple hypothesis testing, we obtained adjusted p values by using the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate procedure <ref type="bibr">(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995)</ref>, adjusted p-value 0.2 significance level is used. An overview of the test results was shown as a Manhattan plot constructed by the statistical package R. Base pair position of SNP markers were given based on the chicken genome assembly build WASHUC2. Inflation factor was calculated by the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f30dc5d529-software-simple-1">R package GenABEL</rs> with "median" option <ref type="bibr">(Aulchenko et al., 2007)</ref>.</p>
            <p>The genome-wide association study revealed 12 significantly associated SNPs that surpassed the significance level <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). As genomic inflation factor is 0.987, it can be concluded that the GWAS result is not inflated by considering relatedness using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="f30dc5d529-software-simple-2">GEMMA</rs> <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref>). Among the significant SNPs, we identified 4 susceptibility SNPs: rs14339964 (Gga3:36327458, p = 4.07 &#61620;10 -9 ), GGaluGA344987 (Gga3:705798, p = 1.12&#61620;10 -6 ),) in the population <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref>. SNP rs14339964 at Gga3:36327458 is located in an intron region of AKT3 which is known to be regulators of cell signaling in response to insulin and growth factors and involved in a wide variety of biological processes. AKT3 is one of the key genes in the formation of melanoma cells <ref type="bibr">(Tsao et al., 2012)</ref>. Previous studies reported that through gene-environment interactions pigmentation pathways can contribute to the formation for melanoma and tumours <ref type="bibr">(Gudbjartsson et al., 2008; Ibarrola- Villava et al., 2012)</ref>. Thus, we indirectly infer that AKT3 mutations may be related to plumage pigmentation. Both SNPs, GGaluGA344987 at Gga3:705798 and rs14641648 at Gga8:12987908, are located in an intergenic region around KRT7 and PAP2 which are associated with pigmentation. PAP2 is another name of LPPR5 which has been found to <ref type="table">Tail</ref> increase pigmentation <ref type="bibr">(Shan et al., 2009</ref>). KRT7 is a member of the keratin gene family and is related with melanocytic tumors <ref type="bibr">(Blum et al., 2010)</ref>. DDX6 encodes a member of the DEAD box protein family, which has multiple functions including translation suppression and mRNA degradation <ref type="bibr">(Weston and Sommerville, 2006)</ref>. DDX6 is a previously confirmed gene for vitiligo which is a disease related with pigmentation of skin <ref type="bibr">(Tang et al., 2012)</ref>. Interestingly, although rs15175679 (Gga20: 8397089, p = 3.91&#61620;10 -6 ) is not significant, the variant exits in gga-mir-668 which is a region that harbors a small RNA. Previous studies of chicken embryogenesis has shown that this small RNA regulates developmental signaling pathways <ref type="bibr">(Shao et al., 2012)</ref>. The results of GWAS of head plumage, wing plumage, breast plumage, back plumage, neck plumage and tail plumage traits, separately identified the same SNPs: rs14339964 and rs15616451 (near gene: AKT3, ENSGALG00000020136) as the result of GWAS with the whole body trait. Through the concordant result, we infer that quantitative analysis of whole body plumage is not a simple trait <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref>.</p>

One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and one-way repeated ANOVA for repeated data were conducted. The aim of the one-way ANOVA was to compare the averages of several physiological parameters relative to the groups; a difference in the mean physiological parameter values of the three groups would result in a statistical difference between subjects classified as heteroschematic male, isoschematic, and heteroschematic female. Accordingly, the calculated P-value would be less than the adopted significance level (5%).</p>

            <p>The MBS was analysed by using specific item numbers for 25(OH)D testing, bone densitometry (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry) and a commonly requested reference test, full blood count (FBC). The latter was used as a control for pathology test utilisation as it is unlikely to have been influenced by topical health trends. For individuals who had one to five tests, we used analysis of variance adjusting for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni post hoc tests to determine whether there was a significant difference in the mean number of individuals being tested each year by quarter (not including duplicate tests) for each test frequency. All analyses were performed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="b09b2ee1dd-software-0">SPSS</rs> V <rs corresp="#b09b2ee1dd-software-0" resp="#curator" type="version">19</rs>. Of the total number of tests, 54% of tests were initial tests and the remaining 46% of tests were subsequent tests, 25% of which were for the second test, 11% the third test and 6% the forth test. The remaining 6% of 25(OH)D tests were for between 5 and 79 tests in that period. Although we were able to distinguish between GP versus specialist, the data were not specific enough to determine if the same provider was performing each test.</p>

            <p>Seedlings were harvested 1, 3, and 5 d after treatment. Glucosinolates were extracted and analysed as previously described, with minor modifications <ref type="bibr">(Sun et al., 2011a, b)</ref>. Fresh tissues (100 mg) were boiled in 1 ml of water for 10 min. After recovery of the liquid, the residues were washed with water (1 ml), and the combined aqueous extract was applied to a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 (30 mg) column (pyridine acetate form). The column was washed three times with 20 mM pyridine acetate and twice with water. The glucosinolates were converted into their desulpho analogues by overnight treatment with 100 &#181;l of 0.1% (1.4 U) aryl sulphatase, and the desulphoglucosinolates were eluted with 2 &#215; 0.5 ml of water. The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was performed using Shimadzu HPLC (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), consisting of two LC-20AT solvent delivery units, a DGU-20A3 degasser, a CTO-10ASVP column oven, an SIL-20A autosampler, and an SPD-M20A diode array detector. The HPLC system was connected to a computer with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="a3772fcaf6-software-0">LC solution</rs> Version <rs corresp="#a3772fcaf6-software-0" resp="#annotator7" type="version">1.25</rs> Software.

Ltd, Dalian, China) was used with a mobile phase of acetonitrile and water at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min -1 . The procedure employed isocratic elution with 1.5% acetonitrile for the first 5 min; a linear gradient to 20% acetonitrile over the next 15 min; followed by isocratic elution with 20% acetonitrile for the final 13 min. A 20 &#181;l sample was injected onto the column by an autosampler. Absorbance was detected at 226 nm. Sinigrin (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) was used as an internal standard for calculation of molar concentrations of individual glucosinolates, and relative response factors were applied to correct absorbance differences between the standard and other glucosinolates <ref type="bibr">(Brown et al., 2003)</ref>.

Subjects in each session were first given 45 min to familiarise themselves with the instructions, complete an accompanying set of control questions and participate in two non-paying practice rounds (see the ''supplementary Appendix'' for the translated instructions). The experiment itself included 10 rounds. All payoffs were stated in ECU (Experimental Currency Unit), and converted to New Israeli Shekels (NIS) at the end of the experiment at a conversion rate of 15 ECU = 1 NIS. The final payoff consisted of the payoff of one randomly chosen round in addition to a show-up fee of 25 NIS. The average payment including show-up fee was 73.33 NIS (approximately 21 USD). Average session duration was approximately 120 min.</p>

            <p>Genotyping and copy number variant detection. Highdensity single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays (HumanCoreExome-12 v1-0; Illumina, San Diego, CA) were used to detect the presence of CNVs from genomic DNA. Arrays were processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. To minimize false-positives, CNVs were called using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c51917cc77-software-0">Nexus Copy Number</rs> package (<rs corresp="#c51917cc77-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">BioDiscovery Inc</rs>, Hawthorne, CA) from signal intensity data after preprocessing in <rs corresp="#c51917cc77-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Illumina</rs> <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c51917cc77-software-1">GenomeStudio</rs> Software. In <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="c51917cc77-software-simple-4">Nexus</rs>, systematic array correction files were used with the linear correction model to correct for GC bias, and a significance threshold of 1 3 10 27 was applied. The SNP-FAST2 Segmentation algorithm was used for analysis, with homozygous frequency threshold at 0.95, hemizygous loss threshold at 20.23, and single copy gain at 0.13 for the log R ratio. A total of 184 samples were processed on the arrays. Samples were removed from the project if they had 1 or more of the following: a ,95% call rate (0 samples), a probe-to-probe variability (quality) of .0.1 (15 samples), a sex mismatch (0 samples), and .100 CNVs (34 samples), leaving n 5 144. To avoid false-positives, only variants that contained .12 consecutive altered SNP probes and that were .20 kb in size were analyzed. CNVs showing .90% coverage of variants of a frequency of $0.1% of the same type, reported in the Database of Genomic Variants (http://dgv.tcag.ca/dgv/app/home), using array comparative genomic hybridization or SNP arrays, were considered copy number polymorphisms and were excluded from further analysis (i.e., CNVs reported in this study are designated as "rare"). CNVs that did not overlap exons of a gene were also excluded. The potential for pathogenicity was based on gene content/disruption, CNV size, frequency, and previous association of genes or regions with epilepsy and related neurologic conditions. Gene products were annotated for Gene Ontology (GO) categories within biological processes and molecular functions using the Gene Ontology Consortium Web tool at http://geneontology.org/.</p>

            <p>All participants had demographic, BMI, waist-hip ratio, blood pressure and glucometabolic (cholesterol, triglycerides, BSL, HbA1c, oGTT and IV GTT) data collected at baseline. In addition, the renal transplant recipients had renal specific and transplant specific data collected pretransplant and at 3 and 12 months posttransplantation. As outlined in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, all patients had baseline IV GTT and oGTT tests. Results for glucose and insulin from multiple time points enabled the calculation of glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, insulin secretion and disposition index. Each test was conducted on a different day and after an overnight fast. The renal transplant recipients had these tests conducted within 2 months of renal transplantation. This group also had an IV GTT and oGTT conducted at 3 and 12 months posttransplantation. IV GTT was also performed on day 7 posttransplantation. Any recipient who had been commenced on a hypoglycemic agent had that agent withheld for 72 hours before each test. The oGTT test was conducted by administering 75 g of oral glucose and drawing a venous sample from an intravenous cannula placed in the cubital fossa of the nonarteriovenous fistula arm at 0, 30, 60 and 120 minutes. The IV GTT test was conducted by administering 0.3 mg/kg intravenous glucose to a maximum dose of 25 g, diluted in normal saline to a maximum volume of 100 mL. Venous samples were drawn from an intravenous cannula placed in the cubital fossa of the non-arteriovenous fistula arm at &#8722;10, &#8722;1, +2, +4, +6, +8, +10, +12, +14, +19, +25, +40 minutes. It has previously been established that this dose of intravenous glucose elicits the maximal pancreatic response over this period <ref type="bibr">21</ref> and similar protocols have been successfully used. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> Glucose metabolism was assessed by 2 different approaches. Firstly, a comprehensive descriptive analysis was aided by the area under the curve (AUC) of oGTT of each recipient at pretransplant, 3 and 12 months posttransplant. Secondly, an improved understanding of the pathophysiology was gained by assessing the first phase insulin release (FPIR), insulin resistance and &#946; cell responsiveness. FPIR is an index of the &#946; cell response to intravenous glucose (insulinogenic index) and was calculated using the IV GTT by FPIR = (AUC insulin t0-10 minutes)/(Glucose t0minutes &#8722; (Av(t-10 minutes and t-1 minutes)) as previously described. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> Insulin resistance was determined using paired insulin and glucose results obtained from IV GTT, which were then applied to the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ed434f1b3b-software-0">homeostatic model assessment 2 (HOMA2)</rs> calculator, available from <rs corresp="#ed434f1b3b-software-0" resp="#curator" type="url">https://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/homacalculator/ download.php</rs>. This has previously been validated in ESKD patients. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> Insulin sensitivity is the inverse of insulin resistance. The DI (IV) was calculated as the FPIR/insulin resistance. The DI (IV) is a measure of &#946; cell responsiveness and has been shown in the general population to bepredictive of the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in those at clinically increased risk. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> Disposition index relates insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance in a hyperbolic relationship such that an increase an insulin resistance is associated with a compensatory increase in insulin secretion to maintain normoglycemia. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> At the time of transplantation, recipients received 20 mg basiliximab on days 0 and 4, 500 mg intravenous methylprednisolone on day 0 followed by 30 mg daily of oral prednisolone which was weaned after 3 weeks by 2.5 mg every 2 weeks to a target dose of 5 mg daily. All recipients received 1 g twice a day of mycophenolate mofetil and a CNI, however, the choice of agent was at the discretion of the treating transplant physician. For those who received cyclosporin, the starting dose was 4 mg/kg twice a day with a C2 target of 1200 for the first month, 800 to 1000 at 3 months and 400 to 600 at 12 months. For those who received tacrolimus, the starting dose was 0.075 mg/kg twice a day with a trough tacrolimus target of 8 to 10 for the first month and 5 to 8 at 3 months. All recipients received protocol cytomegalovirus and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia prophylaxis. Renal transplant biopsies were conducted as protocol at 3 months or as indicated by clinical criteria. Acute cellular rejection was treated with oral prednisolone 300, 200, and 100 mg over 3 consecutive days. To comprehensively assess immunosuppression burden weekly therapeutic drug levels for CNI agents were collected and the cumulative exposure determined by calculating the AUC.</p>
            <p>Data is represented as median and interquartile ranges for continuous variables and as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Continuous variables between groups were compared using Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank sum test. Categorical variables were compared using Fisher exact test. Significance level of 0.05 was not corrected for multiple comparisons due to explorative nature of the study.

            <p>Identification of the average treatment effect on the treated through DD models relies on the parallel trend assumption so that values of our outcome of interest, well-being defined via the GHQ, should follow similar pre-treatment time trends in both Scotland and England. To examine whether this assumption holds, we display GHQ trends by country of residence, gender, marital status and the presence of dependent children in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. For the overall population (which includes both married and single individuals with and without children, upper part of <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>), GHQ trends appear to be broadly similar in Scotland and England before the introduction of the bans. More specifically, while for Scottish and English women GHQ trends appear to slightly converge between waves 14 and 15 (i.e. 1 year before the introduction of the ban in Scotland, although this change amounts to less than a half GHQ point), pre-Scottish ban trends appear very similar for male individuals. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> Both graphs show that in the year when the Scottish ban was introduced (between waves 15 and 16), GHQ levels in Scotland appear to decrease (implying a small increase in SWB), especially among women. Still for the overall population sample of men, SWB also appears to somewhat increase in England after the smoking ban. Graphs for married individuals of both genders (second row of <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) appear to display GHQ trends comparable to the ones of the overall population. Single women in Scotland and England (third row of <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref> show virtually identical self-reported GHQ trends, also during the introduction of the two bans with slight increases in SWB between waves 15 and 16 (Scottish ban) followed by decreases in SWB between waves 16 and 17 (English ban). However, SWB reported by single men seem to vary during the pre-Scottish ban period, although only between GHQ scores of 10 and 11. Men and women with children (fourth row of <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) exhibit relatively stable differences in GHQ levels between England and Scotland before the Scottish ban with increases in SWB during the Scottish ban and simultaneous slight decreases in England. However, the very stable GHQ levels <ref type="bibr">14</ref> In this case, we use England in wave 9 as a baseline country-specific time trend as no public smoking ban was in place at that time. Treatment effects are computed using differences between estimated interaction terms, i.e. interactions between country of residence and time dummies, before and after the Scottish ban in England and Scotland. More specifically, the corresponding treatment effect reported in each table is the one obtained by the following double difference: (Scotland*wave 16 -England*wave 16) -(Scotland*wave 15 -England*wave 15) where waves 15 and 16 are the pre-and post-Scottish ban waves in the BHPS respectively. Standard errors for these treatment effects are obtained using the lincom command in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator31" type="software" xml:id="a6fcc60693-software-simple-0">Stata</rs>. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> The presence of anticipation effects on well-being is explored using placebo tests in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>.among men and women without children (last row) do not appear to be affected by the introduction of the smoking bans. Overall, we observe mostly stable pre-treatment trends and increases in SWB in the year of the implementation of the Scottish ban, especially among women. Yet, specific sub-groups display some, although limited, variation in pre-treatment GHQ trends (e.g. single men) while others present no apparent changes in GHQ levels in the presence of the bans (e.g. men with no children).</p>

Commercial tweets were defined by presence of any of the following: branded promotional messages; URLs linking to commercial websites; usernames indicating affiliations with commercial sites; or user's Twitter page consisting only of promotional tweets (ie, spammer accounts). For the purposes of this study, a tweet containing a commercial link was coded as 'commercial' regardless of whether it was posted by an ostensibly individual account.

We performed multivariate logistic regression to determine the independent effects of serum UA, serum creatinine and serum cystatin C before and after adjusting for the possible confounding factors on maternal and fetal outcomes. The hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, birth weight, gestational age of delivery and mode of delivery were treated as the dependent variables and serum UA, serum creatinine and serum cystatin C as independent variables. Both dependent and independent variables were dichotomized. Hypertension, birth weight and gestational age of delivery were dichotomized using the standard cut-off values. <ref type="bibr">3,17,18</ref> The cut-offs for dichotomization were taken as 5.88 mg/dl for serum uric acid, 19 0.8 mg/dl for serum creatinine 16 and 1.3 mg/L for serum cystatin c. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> Serum uric acid &#8805; 5.88 mg/dl, serum creatinine &#8805; 0.8 mg/dl and serum cystatin C &#8805; 1.3 mg/L were coded as 1 and those less than the cut-offs were coded as 0. For each outcome the first model was unadjusted and the second model was adjusted for the covariates as possible confounders in the analysis. The possible confounders were age, BMI, gestational age, parity and birth weight in the first analysis where hypertensive disorders were taken as the dependent variable <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref>; age, BMI, gestational age, parity and hypertensive disorders in the second analysis where birth weight was taken as the dependent variable <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref>; age, BMI, parity, birth weight and hypertensive disorders in the third analysis where the gestational age of delivery is the outcome <ref type="table">Table 4)</ref>; age, BMI, parity, birth weight, gestational age and hypertensive disorders in the fourth analysis where mode of delivery was taken as the dependent variable <ref type="table">(Table 5)</ref>.

            <p>This cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2014 to May 2015, in an Iranian petrochemical company with 325 employees, located at Asalouyeh, in the southern part of Iran in which methanol was produced as the final product. The sample size was determined with reference to a study by Naqvi et al <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. Taking the b (power) of 80% and a (the first type error) &#188; 5% into consideration, using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="dbc2fab97e-software-0">Medcalc</rs> software (<rs corresp="#dbc2fab97e-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">MedCalc Software</rs> bvba, Ostend, Belgium) the sample size was calculated to be 125.

Pearson correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship between quantitative variables such as stress, job satisfaction, and productivity scores. To assess the factors affecting productivity, linear regression analysis was applied. In all tests, the significance level was set at 0.05.According to <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, the mean score of job stress was calculated to be 181.27 AE 24.17 indicating "moderate-high" level of stress. One-way ANOVA, independent t test and Pearson coefficient statistical procedures did not show any significant relationship between the mean job stress score and demographic characteristics of the participants. Additionally, the statistical analyses revealed no significant relationship between the mean scores of job stress and job satisfaction (p &#188; 0.152) and productivity.</p>

            <p>10 (It can be derived from Equation (B3) in Appendix B.) From Equation <ref type="formula">(10)</ref>, we know that an increase in t A increases the relative domestic price of the imported good. This is the Metzler paradox, in which the imposition of a tariff on imports decreases the relative internal price of that good. Under the paradoxical price changes, an increase in tariff will necessarily increase real purchasing power for domestic consumers. 11 The <rs cert="0.5" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="aaf4d6db28-software-simple-0">Matlab</rs> code is downloadable in mwkang.site11.com/code/rie2016. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> The Ricardian model introduced in this paper has a combination of effects that include expansion and contraction, so it is not obvious whether the condition oEX(a,a 0 )/oa &lt; 0 clearly represents the immiserizing growth effect. To clarify this issue, it is worth presenting a simple model of endowment economy. With the same CES utility functions as in Equation 18, country A's endowment for good (x, y) is ffiffi ffi k p a; 0 &#192; &#193; and country B's endowment is 0; ffiffi ffi k p a 0 &#192; &#193; . In this endowment economy, there exists closed form solutions for the equilibrium allocations, and the condition for country A's welfare to decrease as a increases is that E &lt; 0.5 for any value of a 0 &gt; 0, a ! a 0 , and k &gt; 0, which is the same as the condition in Equation <ref type="formula">(21)</ref>.</p>
            <p>From a(b) and b(a), we can derive the Nash equilibrium specialization (a*,b*) which satisfies a (b*) 5 a* and b(a*) 5 b*.

            <p>E2F7 is a direct target of miR-26a and is upregulated in AML. We previously showed that miR-26a negatively regulates cell proliferation and stimulates myeloid differentiation of AML cells. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> Notably, miR-26a negatively regulates G 1 /S transition in different tumors and this has been attributed, at least in part, to the direct regulation of EZH2 by miR-26a. <ref type="bibr">16,17,19,21</ref> However, we showed that EZH2 is not a direct target of miR-26a in AML cells. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> Thus, we decided to investigate novel relevant targets for miR-26a function in AML. Between the putative targets of miR-26a, we noticed the E2F7 transcription factor (data from <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="adbb45e356-software-0">TargetScan</rs> (<rs corresp="#adbb45e356-software-0" resp="#annotator17" type="url">www.targetscan.org</rs>) and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="adbb45e356-software-1">Pictar</rs> (<rs corresp="#adbb45e356-software-1" resp="#curator" type="url">pictar.mdc-berlin.de</rs>)), an important regulator of the G 1 /S-phase transition. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> The 3'-untranslated region (3 0 -UTR) of E2F7 contained two highly conserved putative binding sites for miR-26a <ref type="figure">(Figure 1a)</ref>. To show the direct targeting of E2F7 by miR-26a, we constructed luciferase reporters containing the wild type (WT) 3 0 -UTR of E2F7 (WT), the E2F7 3 0 -UTR mutated at the miR-26a binding site I (Mut1), the E2F7 3 0 -UTR mutated at the miR-26a binding site II (Mut2) or the E2F7 3 0 -UTR mutated at both miR-26a binding sites (Mut1-2). Luciferase reporters were individually co-transfected in HeLa cells with a plasmid expressing miR-26a or control <ref type="figure">(Figure 1b)</ref>. The expression of WT reporter was significantly decreased by miR-26a compared with control. Reporter Mut1 behaved similarly to WT, while deletion of Mut2 partially relieved translational repression. On the other hand, expression of the reporter construct mutated at both miR-26a binding sites of E2F7 3 0 -UTR (Mut1-2) was not sensitive to miR-26a translational repression. This may be explained by the fact that the binding of miR-26a on site II increases the accessibility to site I or, alternatively, binding of one repressive complex on site II may serve as scaffold for attracting cofactors necessary for repression on site I. These results demonstrated that miR-26a regulated E2F7 expression through direct binding of the 3 0 -UTR. To further demonstrate that miR-26a represses E2F7 expression in AML, U937 cells were infected with a lentivirus containing an miR-26a expression cassette (Lenti-26a) or control (Mock inf.). Enforced expression by lentiviral transduction significantly increased miR-26a levels with a concomitant decrease in E2F7 protein levels <ref type="figure">(Figure 2a)</ref>. Similar results were obtained with the HL-60 cell line (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Altogether, these data indicated that E2F7 is a direct target of miR-26a in AML.</p>
            <p>RNA interference and miR-26a overexpression. E2F7 knockdown was obtained by Mission Lentiviral shRNA clones targeting E2F7 TRCN0000017455 and TRCN000017453 (Sigma-Aldrich). Mission Lentiviral Non-Targeting shRNA clone SHC002 (Sigma-Aldrich) was utilized as control.The miR-26a target E2F7 counteracts monocytic differentiation B Salvatori et al Lentiviral particles were prepared according to the manufacturer's specifications. Lentiviral vectors for miR-26a expression and control were described previously. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> Infection of AML cell lines was performed as described previously. <ref type="bibr">40</ref> Cell proliferation and differentiation. For cell cycle analysis, 2 &#194; 10 5 cells were resuspended in PBS/50% FCS, fixed in 70% ethanol for 24 h, incubated with 50 Ag/ml propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 U/ml DNase-free RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich), and analyzed after 3 h (10 000 events) using an Epics XL Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Morphology was evaluated after 7 days from lentiviral transduction in conventional light-field microscopy of Wright-Giemsa-stained cytospins. Differentiation was assessed by direct immunofluorescence staining of cells using an allophycocyanin anti-human CD11b (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA), PerCP anti-human CD14 (Becton Dickinson) and PE-IgG1 isotype control (eBiosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) as described previously. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> A minimum of 10 000 events were collected for each sample with flow cytometer (CyAN ADP; Dako Italia S.p.a., Milan, Italy) by using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="adbb45e356-software-2">Summit</rs> <rs corresp="#adbb45e356-software-2" resp="#annotator17" type="version">4.3</rs> software (<rs corresp="#adbb45e356-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Beckman Coulter</rs>) for data acquisition and analysis.RNA extraction and analysis. Total RNA was prepared using Qiazol reagent and miRNAeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Hsa-miR-26a analysis by real-time PCR was performed using miRScript System (Qiagen) and E2F7 analysis was performed with QuantiTect Primer Assay QT00059115 (Qiagen). Delta-delta Ct values were normalized with those obtained from the amplification of the endogenous U6 snRNA (Qiagen). P-values between primary AML samples and monocytes data were obtained with t-test. cDNAs for p21, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 analysis were generated with miRScript RT Kit (Qiagen). Oligonucleotides are described in the primers list (shown below). M-CSF, M-CSFr and MafB were detected with TaqMan oligonucleotides Hs00166144_m1, Hs00234622_m1 and Hs00534343_s1, respectively, and normalized by the amplification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) Hs99999905_m1 (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies Italia, Monza MB, Italy). MiR-17 and miR-20a were detected with TaqMan microRNA assay TM-393 and TM-580 (Applied Biosystems), respectively. Delta-delta Ct values were normalized with those obtained from the amplification of the endogenous U6 snRNA, TaqMan probe TM-1093 (Applied Biosystems). All reactions were performed in triplicate. </p>

            <p>This was a cross-sectional study for evaluating health related quality of life in lower limbs amputation veterans of Iran. In the present study, data collected from 38 lower limbs amputation veterans and 50 normal healthy controls that live in all provinces of Iran with face-to-face interview. The control group is matched in gender, education, and age with amputee group. All participants were male. Mean age for amputee group were 43.91 (&#177; 6.21) and for normal healthy subjects were 43.66 (&#177; 6.07). The duration of amputation was 24.55 (&#177; 2.61) years. HRQOL was assessed by means of the Medical Outcomes Research 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), which has been validated in the Iranian population <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref>. The SF-36 consists of 36 questions integrating eight multi item scales: physical functioning (PF); role limitations caused by physical problems (RP); bodily pain (BP); general health perceptions (GH); vitality, energy, or fatigue (VT); social functioning (SF); role limitations caused by emotional problems (RE), and general mental health (MH). Based on these scales, component summary scores were calculated to provide a global measure of physical and mental functioning; the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) were derived from the eight multi-item scales. The scales and summary components ranged from 0 to 100, where higher values denote better functioning and fewer limitations. For each question basis on number of item in Lickert scale, each item pointed from 0 to 100. The SF-36 derived scores did not have a cutoff point to differentiate between good or poor Available at http://ijph.tums.ac.ir HRQOL. This questionnaire had been translated to Persian and validated for Iranian population. The internal consistency (to test reliability) showed that all eight SF-36 scales met the minimum reliability standard, the Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.90 with the exception of the vitality scale (alpha = 0.65) <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>. Inclusion criteria were amputation of lower limbs veterans based on observation. Veterans were excluded, as were severely mentally handicapped and subjects unable to understand Persian language.

            <p>Expression Profiling Analysis-Lungs from fibrillin-1-deficient mice and littermate controls at postnatal day 1 (PD1) and postnatal day 5 (PD5) were harvested and quickly frozen. Lungs from two groups of mice (wild-type and fibrillin-1-deficient) at each time point were pooled in groups of two or three. Total RNA was extracted using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). Expression profiling was done with Affymetrix A734 GeneChips (48 chips for this study), containing &#1011;7000 full-length genes and &#1011;1000 expressed sequence tags. Biotinylated cRNAs prepared from total RNAs were hybridized to U34A GeneChips in duplicate. Fluorescent signals were measured with a Hewlett Packard G2500A Gene Array Scanner. Data were analyzed with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="cc9396bef1-software-0">Affymetrix suite</rs> <rs corresp="#cc9396bef1-software-0" resp="#annotator12" type="version">5.0</rs>, corrected for saturation, and evaluated with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="cc9396bef1-software-1">GeneSpring</rs> <rs corresp="#cc9396bef1-software-1" resp="#curator" type="version">5.0</rs> software. The primary gene expression data can be found on the World Wide Web at the NCBI GEO data base (GDS242).</p>
            <p>Western Blot Analysis-Total cell lysates were extracted in M-Per buffer from Pierce. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Aliquots of 30 -50 g of protein were boiled and then loaded onto Tris-HCl gels and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Detection was by the Pierce West DuraImmunohistochemistry-Tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated in an ethanol series. Sections were blocked for nonspecific binding with 3% normal serum from chicken and incubated with the primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. For immunofluorescence, sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies at 1:200 for 30 min at room temperature (Molecular Probes). Sections were counterstained with 4&#1032;,6-diamidinio-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and mounted with Vectashield hard set mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). For immunohistochemistry, following incubation with the primary antibody overnight at 4&#176;C, slides were washed with PBST, incubated with an appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and developed by using ABC protocol. 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, and 3,3&#1032;-diaminobenzidine detection reagents (Vector Laboratories). Antibodies were used at the following concentrations: NeuroD (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),Neuroendocrine Cell Quantitation-For details of the protocol, refer to Ref. 14. To characterize NE differentiation in fibrillin-deficient mice and wild-type littermates, we counted the total number of synaptophysin, CGRP, and PGP9.5 immunoreactive solitary PNECs and NEBs (neuroendocrine foci) in formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung sections. This was correlated to the number of airways in the same sections (foci/ airway). To determine the size of NEBs in these same mice, pictures of each NEB were acquired using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="cc9396bef1-software-2">MetaMorph</rs> software (<rs corresp="#cc9396bef1-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Universal Imaging/Molecular Devices</rs>, Downingtown, PA). The immunoreactive area was manually outlined and measured using the same software, and the size in m 2 for each individual NEB was tabulated. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="cc9396bef1-software-simple-6">SigmaStat</rs>).</p>

Welch's t test was performed to calculate the probabilities of significant gene expression changes. Since the probe sets were tested multiple times, we used a highly stringent p value cut-off (p &#1021; 0.001) to reduce the number of false positives to less than 1 in 1000.</p>

            <p>Even though these 5 0 -SS sequences display some affinity for the SRSF1 RBD, our results do not necessarily imply that SRSF1 binds to these sequences within their natural cellular context. Our binding data simply suggest that the 5 0 -SS sequences bear some characteristics of a functional ESE, as predicted by <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="e121790287-software-simple-0">ESEfinder</rs>.

            <p><rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-0">Hangman</rs> [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galgenm%C3% A4nnchen] is a classical game for two or more players in which one player thinks of a word and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters. The game is over if the player needs more guesses than allowed. The idea of this game has been adapted within the project "<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-1">Mediman</rs>" so that medical terms must be guessed. At the end of each game the term is defined and explained to produce a benfit for the student (see <ref type="figure">figure 2</ref>). <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-2">Mediman</rs> uses a <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-3">MySQL</rs> database to store the data and AJAX ("Asynchronus JavaScript and XML") to increase usability, e.g. no page reload is necessary to start a new game round as data is loaded in the background. During the development simulation programs where used that emulate the smartphones on the development PC. The benefit is that the developer does not actually has to own all the devices to run tests with them.</p>
            <p>To start the application the user needs to type in the internet adress (URL) -no installation is required. If the website is additionally added to the home screen a defined icon appears and the difference between a native application and a web site simulating it vanishes even more (see <ref type="figure">figure 1 and figure 2</ref>). Subsequent to the development process a questionnaire with nine items was desigend. If not declared otherwise a Likert scalling was used. Test users (n=20) were asked to submit the online forms between June and Juliy 2012 after they received an invitation via e-mail. All test users are students (third year or above) attending Faculty of Medicine of the University of Munich and took part voluntarily. The data analysis was performed with <rs corresp="#a6e72f552b-software-8" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Microsoft</rs> <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-8">Excel</rs>.</p>
            <p>Smartphones are widely spread devices with plenty of possible applications due to their connection to the internet. The Faculty of Medicine of the University of Stanford for example picked up this trend and equip every new medical student with an Apple iPad since 2010 <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. Parallel to the introduction the faculty established a portal with learning material (presentations, videos, manuals and more) which can be accessed by the students for free using a app <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. This allows the students to access the needed material when they want and how often they want. So far, available e-learning programs, e.g. <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-6">CASUS</rs>, work within a desktop environment -and they do their job mostly fine. Those programs are therefore designed and optimised for desktop computers (with internet browsers), big screens and a computer mouse for interaction. The e-learning programs can be used with modern smartphones aswell but they are always suboptimal with respect to usability and legibility. The growing role smartphones play in our daily life due to their increasing market share demands an adaptation to the changed needs of the users. The analysis of the questionnaire showes that the test users think that smartphones are an ideal learning environment because most of them carry one with them all the time. This is comprehensible as for the first time ever more smartphones than desktop computers have been sold last year [http://www.canalys.com/ newsroom/smart-phones-overtake-client-pcs-2011]. The survey showed aswell that not enough learning applications specially designed for smartphones exist (see <ref type="figure">figure 2</ref>), the desire for them though is high (see <ref type="table">table 2</ref>). In our opinion the results however do not allow the conclusion that existing learning applications should simply be optimised for the smaller display sizes. The demands of the users seem to be more differentiated as they seem to look for short sessions explicitly. A test user submited the free text item covering the needs of the users with the comment that he or she would like to start sessions while travelling betwen two university locations or even when sitting in the train. Short texts and optimised cases for the repetition of knowledge seem the be more important than continuous text. Applications -generally speaking -can be produced as native applications for a chosen manufacturer or operating system (e.g.  <rs corresp="#a6e72f552b-software-9" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Apple</rs> <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-9">iOS</rs>, <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-9">Android</rs>) and can then advertised and sold through the manufacturer's online store. The manufacturers support the developers by providing developmental environments and content (SDK). Apple, for example, will check each version before deploying it to the online store and can even refuse to publish it.</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-10">Mediman</rs> uses a different way. Instead of developing the application for the various operating systems individually the author used programming languages that are normally used to program websites (HTML, CSS, Javascript) in combination with a JavaScript framework called <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-11">jQuery mobile</rs>. This framework simulates a native application optically and because the necessary skills already existed no further longsome familiarisation with SDKs was necessary. This ensured a short development time, the list of supported devices of the framework is long and checks by the manufacturers prior to the aproval of an application to their online store does not exist. As a sort of hybrid technique <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-11">Phonegap</rs> (<rs corresp="#a6e72f552b-software-11" resp="#curator" type="url">http://phonegap.com</rs>) must be mentioned (web sites will be transformed and compiled into native apps) but was not chosen for the development of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-14">Mediman</rs> as it would have required training. Offering applications through the online stores means automatic avertising but web applications allow faster publication due to no certivication process.</p>
            <p>The results of the survey show that learning applications designed as a web site with an ideal integration into the smartphone -simulating a native application -seems to work for the test users. The users liked the adaptation of the game <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-15">Hangman</rs> into a medical learning program. The used JavaScript framework ensured fast developing and publishing. We did not find any relevant limitations using web site programming languages as no device specific function, e.g. motion sensor, was used. Those functions can normally only be used if the SDK is used. Uncertainty exists insofar as the analysis of the submited data of the test users did not show a clear trend if an active internet connection may be a requirement for running the learning application (see <ref type="table">table 2</ref>). The anxiety that this is explicitly a problem of the used programming languages used in the example project <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-16">Mediman</rs> can be qualified as version 5 of HTML supports storing data locally [http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html]. Apart from the technical aspect the author thinks that mobile plans with unlimited traffic are common. The importance of smartphones increases in learning environments. Today, only few learning applications designed to work seamlessly on smartphones exist -this is reflected in the usage frequency. It does not seem to be the one and only solution to adapt existing e-learning programs to fit into the small screen sizes because the needs of users is different. The survey showed that dealing with learning applications for smartphones will be an important topic in the future.<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a6e72f552b-software-simple-17">Mediman</rs>, the example project that was used mainly to demonstrate the potential and feasibility of the realisation of a small and simple learning application for smartphones was rated well within the questionnaire. As this was one of the main aims the project succeeded in our opinion and further devlopments should be considered.</p>

            <p>At flowering time, a small amount of pollen was collected from six anthers of each bud, mixed, and then stained with 1% (w/v) acetocarmine solution. Lengths of short axes of pollen grains (100-400) were microscopically measured using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="d6f373b2e3-software-2">Image-Pro PLUS</rs> (<rs corresp="#d6f373b2e3-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Media Cybernetics Co., Ltd</rs>., Bethesda, MD, USA). In the control and N 2 O-treated plants of 'Yelloween', microspore tetrad sizes were measured from young anthers of 30-35 mm floral buds. Pollen fertility was determined using the acetocarmine method, whereby acetocarmine-stained pollen was regarded as fertile pollen. Before pollination, the germinability of the pollen obtained by N 2 O treatment was assessed after culture for 24 h at 25&#176;C in agar medium containing 10% (w/v) sucrose, 0.7% (w/v) agar, 0.3 g/L calcium nitrate and 10 mg/L boric acid.</p>

For 8.52 % of the reads the barcode could not be identified unambiguously. These reads were excluded from further analysis. Another quality filtering step was imposed by our read-joining algorithm which requires that both reads of each read pair exhibit significant overlaps. 94.8% &#177; 1.81% of all read pairs could by joined successfully to one consensus sequence. Finally, the joined reads were classified and filtered again for occurrence of possible k1/k1 -boxes, which was the case for 90.6% &#177; 2.4%. In the end, compared to the original raw read numbers, on average 83.5% &#177; 2.2% of reads were used for the data analysis, which was equivalent to around 8.5 million read pairs.</p>

            <p>The Kaplan -Meier method was pre-specified as the method for evaluating the safety objective so all patients with an implant attempt could be included in the analysis. However, since no USADEs were observed, the exact binomial test comparing the observed 3-month USADE free rate to the null value of 85% was used to evaluate the safety objective and derive the lower 97.5% confidence interval (CI). A onesample t-test comparing the observed mean 3-month pacing capture threshold to the null value of 2.0 V was used to test the efficacy objective. In addition, paired t-tests were used to compare electrical variables measured at implant and the 3-month visit.

The logistic regression models were used to study the association between significant coronary lesions, multivessel involvement, CS &#8805; 100, plaque types and risk factors for CAD. The analysis was adjusted for age, gender, DM, SAH, dyslipidemia, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, smoking and family history of CAD.</p>

            <p>Orbitrap settings for the identification of phosphopeptides and relative phosphorylation state analysis After phosphopeptide enrichment, TiO 2 -peptide eluates were loaded on a 1D nano-flow LC-MS/MS system equipped with pre-column (Agilent, Zeesen, Germany). A monolithic column (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) of 15 cm length and 0.1 mm internal diameter was coupled to an Orbitrap LTQ XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, Ulm, Germany). Peptides were eluted during a 50-min gradient from 5-100% (v/v) methanol/0.1% (v/v) FA with a controlled flow rate of 0.5 ll min &#192;1 . For precursor masses determinations, resolution and accuracy of the Orbitrap were set to 3000 ppm and 2 ppm, respectively. MS/MS measurements were performed on wideband mode. Spray voltage was set to 1.8 kV and temperature of the heated transfer capillary was set to 150&#176;C. Potential phosphopeptide candidates were evaluated using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="e7ef12082b-software-2">MSQuant</rs> <rs corresp="#e7ef12082b-software-2" resp="#annotator17" type="version">1.4</rs> software. A post-translational modification (PTM) score for localization, which estimates the probability to find an actual phosphorylation site based on fragment ions <ref type="bibr">(Olsen et al., 2006)</ref>, is shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. For the relative quantification of phosphorylation levels, gel digests were directly analysed using the same settings as described for phosphopeptide identification.</p>
            <p>In the present work, MS analysis revealed that SuSy1 from the nodules of M. truncatula is also phosphorylated at Ser11, the same residue identified as phosphorylated in soybean and homologous to Ser15 in maize SuSy1 (VHS 11 LKER; spectra can be found in ProMEX database http://promex.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/home.shtml). In addition, the relative phosphorylation state of the protein was analysed and quantified by comparing peak areas of the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated tryptic peptides derived from the same analysis (see also 'Determination of phosphorylation stoichiometry', and the workflow diagram in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1)</ref>.</p>
            <p>This study has demonstrated for the first time the absolute quantification of three distinct M. truncatula SuSy isoforms in an independent tissue-specific manner. It is shown that, besides the nodule-enhanced SuSy1, two other protein isoforms are present in root nodules at quantifiable amounts. De novo sequencing allowed for the identification of a new peptide sequence, most probably driven from the second most abundant isoform SuSy2, which complements the existing sequence information based on transcript data. Absolute quantification of N metabolism enzymes was carried out, enabling the discrimination of different protein isoforms from a single analysis, even when those isoforms were present at very low amounts. Nodule SuSy1 was shown to be hyperphosphorylated at Ser11 in M. truncatula and novel phosphoproteins present in nodules were identified. All peptides found in this study can be viewed in the ProMEX spectral library <ref type="bibr">(Hummel et al., 2007)</ref>.</p>

            <p>A related BMA analysis we can perform using our covariates is an examination of the determinants of trade flows. This is an interesting litmus test for the BMA procedure, as we would be concerned, for example, if standard gravity variables did not have high inclusion probabilities for trade flows using our BMAmethods. The analysis also provides a comparison of the determinants of FDI and trade flows within the same framework. We gather data on bilateral trade flows from the dataset connected with <ref type="bibr">Rose and Spiegel (2011)</ref> and made available online by Andrew Rose at faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/arose/RecRes.htm#Software. Specifically, the data are CIF imports measured in US$, taken from International Financial Statistics'Direction of Trade CD-ROM, deflated by U.S. CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), all items, 1982 to 1984 = 100. For comparison purposes, we sample the year 2000 for the same observations we use for our cross-border M&amp;A results, which yielded the largest sample size out of all the FDI measures. <ref type="table">Table 10</ref> provides inclusion probabilities for our BMA analysis of trade flows, as well as repeats the cross-border M&amp;A inclusion probabilities for comparison purposes. The table displays all variables that receive a 50% or higher inclusion probability for explaining at least one of either trade flows or M&amp;A counts. Reassuringly, our BMA analysis of trade flows yields results that are quite in line with accepted practice on how to specify trade flows. The gravity variables and typical frictions (including trade and FDI agreements) show very strong support. This also means that our analysis suggests very similar determinants for trade and cross-border M&amp;A, though there is much less support generally for endowment terms with trade than for cross-border M&amp;A. The biggest differences between the two come in which business cost, infrastructure and other host-country attributes matter for trade versus cross-border M&amp;A. For example, the number of Internet users, legal institutions and domestic credit have high inclusion probabilities for trade but not for cross-border M&amp;A. This is not the first BMA analysis of trade flows. Eicher, Henn and Papageorgiou (2012) use BMA methods to examine the impact of preferential trade agreements on trade flows. They estimate very similar inclusion probabilities for the common overlap of variables between their study and ours, including strong support for GDP terms, geographic features (such as distance) and cultural distance terms.</p>

            <p>A collection of 248 B. napus accessions was used for association mapping (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S1</ref> <ref type="bibr">2008 and 2009, respectively)</ref>. Under these growth conditions, in central China both semi-winter and winter types are generally sufficiently vernalized to flower after winter. Spring type accessions grown under these conditions do not usually start flowering before the onset of winter. During the winter months, plant growth slows down or comes to a halt, but the relatively mild winter temperatures at the chosen location in central China generally allows the spring types to survive as well. Flowering time in both field trials was recorded as the days from sowing to the date when the first flower had opened on half of the plants of an accession. Furthermore, accessions were classified as spring, semi-winter or winter types according to the annotation of the original cultivars (Chinese Crop Germplasm Information System (CGRIS), http://icgr.caas.net.cn/cgris_english.html) or their general performance in the field (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S</ref> <ref type="bibr">(Sambrook et al., 1989)</ref>. DNA of positive BAC clones was extracted using the NucleoBond&#210; PC 500 plasmid DNA purification kit (Macherey &amp; Nagel GmbH &amp; Co. KG, D&#252; ren, Germany). Sequence identity or homology to the probe fragment was confirmed by PCR amplification and sequencing of BAC DNA using primer pair A102-A103. The BAC clones were grouped into three sequence groups according to a multiple sequence alignment using the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d825927b9e-software-simple-0">AlignX</rs> module of the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d825927b9e-software-0">Vector NTI software package</rs> (<rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Invitrogen</rs> Corporation, Carlsbad, USA). To identify the full-length genomic sequences, one BAC of each group was selected for primer walking using primers A127, A133, A201, A248, A249, A250, A260, A261, A262, A372, and A378 (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S2</ref> at JXB online).

Following the nomenclature for Brassica genes <ref type="bibr">(Ostergaard and King, 2008)</ref>, the three FRI homologues were designated as BnaA.FRI.a, BnaX.FRI.b, and BnaX.FRI.c.</p>
            <p>SNP detection and inference of haplotypes in a collection of B. napus accessions According to the flowering time data of 248 accessions from two growth seasons (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S1</ref> at JXB online), a subset of 95 accessions including similar numbers of early, intermediate, and late flowering accessions were selected for a first genotypic analysis. The BnaA.FRI.a-specific primer combinations N036-A385 and N053-N020 were used to genotype these accessions by PCR amplification and sequencing. Two primers (N018 and A385) were used for sequencing the N036-A385 PCR products, and three primers (N020, N054, and N057) were used for sequencing the N053-N020 products. Whole gene sequences were obtained by assembling the sequence data from these sequencing reactions for each accession. Sequences were aligned using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d825927b9e-software-9">VectorNTI</rs> <rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-9" resp="#annotator5" type="version">10.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-9" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Invitrogen Corporation</rs>, Carlsbad, USA) or<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d825927b9e-software-10">CLC main workbench</rs> <rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-10" resp="#annotator5" type="version">5</rs> (<rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-10" resp="#curator" type="publisher">CLC bio</rs>, Aarhus, Denmark), and alignments were edited manually using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d825927b9e-software-11">BioEdit</rs> software (<rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-11" resp="#annotator5" type="url">http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html</rs>). Haplotypes were inferred using the software <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d825927b9e-software-12">HAP</rs> at default parameters (<rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-12" resp="#curator" type="url">http:// research.calit2.net/hap</rs>). Three primers (N069, N076, and N078; see Supplementary Table S2 at JXB online) were designed to differentiate between the two nucleotides for each of the three haplotype tagging SNPs (htSNPs) detected by HAP in haplotype block 2. All 248 accessions were genotyped at these htSNP positions by PCR with primer combinations N069-N020, N053-N076, and N053-N078. Haplotypes were scored according to the presence or absence of the respective bands after agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR products (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S1</ref> at JXB online).</p>
            <p>Population structure evaluation 28 publicly available SSR markers (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S3</ref> at JXB online) were selected from <ref type="bibr">Cheng et al. (2009)</ref> which were distributed equally across the genetic map of B. napus. To reduce costs, an M13-tailing PCR technique was used <ref type="bibr">(Schuelke, 2000)</ref>. For each SSR primer combination, the forward sequence of the M13 primer was added to the 5# end of the forward SSR primer and the reverse sequence of the M13 primer was added to the 5' end of the reverse SSR primer. PCR reactions were performed with four primers, the M13F-forward SSR primer, the M13Rreverse SSR primer, an IRD700-labelled M13F primer (MWG Operon, Ebersberg, Germany) and an unlabelled M13R primer. The 28 SSR markers were used to assay the 95 accessions which were selected for the first round of genotyping. The DNA analyser system Li-Cor 4300 (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) was used for electrophoresis and detection of PCR products. The presence or absence of PCR product bands was scored as 1 or 0, respectively. The software <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d825927b9e-software-13">STRUCTURE</rs> <rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-13" resp="#annotator5" type="version">2.2.3</rs> was used to estimate population structure (<rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-13" resp="#curator" type="url">http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/ structure.html</rs>) <ref type="bibr">(Pritchard et al., 2000)</ref>. K values ranging from 1 to 10 were tested with a burn-in of 100 000 iterations and 100 000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations according to the software's instructions.</p>
            <p>The effect of population structure on flowering time was tested using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator25" type="software" xml:id="d825927b9e-software-39">SAS</rs> GLM (<rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-39" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SAS Institute</rs>, Cary, North Carolina, USA).

Only SNPs with frequencies larger than 0.05 were included for LD calculation. To avoid redundancy, each InDel was considered as a single polymorphic site.</p>
            <p>For SNP/InDel-based association analysis, a structure-based model which takes population structure into account to reduce spurious associations was used. Associations between markers and the total trait variation were tested using a general linear model (GLM) which was implemented in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d825927b9e-software-16">TASSEL</rs> <rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-16" resp="#annotator5" type="version">2.01</rs>.

The null hypothesis of this study was that the occurrence of polymorphisms in BnaA.FRI.a is independent of the variation in flowering time, whereas the alternative hypothesis was that polymorphisms are associated with flowering time variation. Only polymorphisms with frequencies above 0.05 were included and 1000 permutations were performed. An adjusted P value &lt;0.05 was considered as a criterion for association. For haplotype association analysis, block 1 and block 2 were regarded as two polymorphic loci. Different haplotypes in the same block were regarded as allelic variants at one locus. For further analysis of association between haplotype and flowering time variation in a larger panel which included 248 accessions, the software <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d825927b9e-software-18">SAS</rs> <rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-18" resp="#annotator5" type="version">9.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-18" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SAS Institute</rs>, Cary, North Carolina, USA) was used to conduct an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multi-comparison analyses with least significant differences (LSD).</p>
            <p>The exon-intron structure of all four FRI homologues was identified by RT-PCR and sequencing and was found to be conserved between the B. napus genes and functional FRI alleles in A. thaliana <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2A)</ref>. Gene expression was analysed in leaves, stems, floral buds, and flowers of three different B. napus accessions, the winter type Express, the semi-winter type Ningyou7 (with or without prior vernalization), and the spring type Haydn (with or without prior vernalization), using primer combinations specific for either the gene pair BnaA.FRI.a/BnaX.FRI.d or BnaX.FRI.b/BnaX.FRI.c. Individual genes of a gene pair were distinguished by gel electrophoresis on the basis of size differences (BnaA.FRI.a/ BnaX.FRI.d), or by gel electrophoresis following XhoI restriction (BnaX.FRI.b and BnaX.FRI.c). RT-PCR fragments of the expected sizes were obtained in most samples from all three accessions, demonstrating that all four B. napus FRI genes are expressed in accessions of different growth types <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2B)</ref>. Expression levels were similar between the different ecotypes and between vernalized and non-vernalized plants. However, while BnaX.FRI.b and BnaX.FRI.c transcripts were ubiquitously and relatively evenly expressed across all tissues analysed, BnaA.FRI.a and BnaA.FRI.d exhibited marked differences in expression, which ranged from barely detectable in leaves and stems to very high in flowers <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2B)</ref>. For BnaA.FRI.a, differential spatial expression was confirmed by transcript-specific RT-qPCR in Ningyou7 <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2C)</ref> <ref type="bibr">Johanson et al., 2000)</ref> was used for the alignment. The conserved 'Frigida' domain according to Pfam
          24.0 (http://pfam.janelia.org) is indicated by vertical brackets. The regions corresponding to the two coiled-coil domains in FRI are marked by the grey horizontal brackets below the alignment. The nine residues within a 37 amino acid N-terminal region (marked by the black bar above the alignment) which are typical for family I proteins among FRI homologues <ref type="bibr">(Risk et al., 2010)</ref> and are conserved in all four B. napus genes are indicated by asterisks. The arrows mark the three eight amino acid (MEEARSIS) repeats in BnaA.FRI.a.BnaA.FRI.a marker was integrated into the genetic map generated with the TNDH population <ref type="bibr">(Long et al., 2007)</ref> and was mapped on chromosome A03 at position 49.8 cM between markers S15M04-2-85 and RA2E11. Using the genetic map containing the BnaA.FRI.a marker, the QTL map for flowering time data from 11 environments <ref type="bibr">(Long et al., 2007)</ref> was recalculated. A flowering time QTL cluster with two major peaks was detected on chromosome A03 between 10 cM and 60 cM <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref>. BnaA.FRI.a is centrally located within the narrow confidence intervals (48.8-50.9 cM) of QTL detected in seven environments at the position of one of the two major QTL peaks <ref type="figure">(Table 1; Fig. 3</ref>). Interestingly, the flowering time QTL co-localizing with BnaA.FRI.a were detected in both winter <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3A)</ref> and spring environments <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3B)</ref>. The QTL explained up to 12.0% of the phenotypic variation in winter environments and up to 8.1% in spring enviroments. The early-flowering allele is derived from the semi-winter type parent Ningyou7.</p>
            <p>To determine the degree of LD within BnaA.FRI.a,<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d825927b9e-software-21">TASSEL</rs> <rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-21" resp="#annotator5" type="version">2.01</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Bradbury et al., 2007)</ref> was used to calculate R 2 values for each pair of polymorphisms. Out of 780 pairs of polymorphic sites, 646 showed significant linkage with P &lt;0.05. LD decay for BnaA.FRI.a is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>A. For distances larger than approximately 2 kb, the R 2 value is lower than 0.2. This indicates that LD decays rapidly within this gene, suggesting that BnaA.FRI.a is suitable for an analysis of gene-trait associations.Population structure and impact on flowering time variation</p>
            <p>As there was no SNP with significant association to flowering time in both years, a haplotype-based association analysis was performed. Using the software <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d825927b9e-software-23">HAP</rs> (<rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-23" resp="#curator" type="url">http:// research.calit2.net/hap</rs>) to infer haplotypes for BnaA.FRI.a among all accessions, two haplotype blocks were found within this gene. 27 SNPs or InDels were located in block 1 (position -140 to 1223, including exon 1) and 13 SNPs or InDels in block 2 (position 1224 to 2182, including exons 2 and 3). Three common haplotypes (represented by more than two accessions each) were identified in block 1, while four common haplotypes were found in block 2. Three polymorphic sites <ref type="bibr">(InDel99, SNP282, and SNP348)</ref> in block 1 and three polymorphic sites <ref type="bibr">(SNP1224, SNP1615, and SNP1790)</ref> in block 2 were identified as haplotype tagging SNPs (htSNPs) or InDels <ref type="table">(Table 4;</ref> Taking population structure into account, block 2 showed association with flowering time for both years (P &lt;0.05).</p>
            <p>Consistent with the phase relationships in the QTL population, the BnaA.FRI.a allele in the parental accession Ningyou7 corresponds to the earliest flowering haplotype 4, whereas the Tapidor allele corresponds to the latest flowering haplotype 3. Although there are several nonsynonymous SNPs within haplotype block 2, including the htSNP at position 1790 which shows a SNP-trait association in one year (P&#188;0.017 in 2008; <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>) and could possibly affect protein function, the protein sequence in this region is identical between the two extreme haplotypes 3 and 4. However, the two haplotypes differ at two positions at the nucleotide sequence level, i.e. the htSNP at position 1615 and the SNP at position 1702, which are both located within the coding sequence. In addition to the SNPs observed between haplotypes 3 and 4, the two alleles in the TNDH population carry multiple additional polymorphisms, including several SNPs and a 3 bp indel in the promoter region, two indels in the 5# UTR and six nonsynonymous SNPs in exon 1 (see <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. S1</ref> at JXB online). Among the six non-synonymous SNPs, two are located within the Frigida domain, but not at positions which are conserved among FRI family I proteins in A. thaliana and other rosid species <ref type="bibr">(Risk et al., 2010)</ref>, and two are located in the non-conserved region between the Frigida domain and the N-terminal putative coiled-coil domain. The remaining two non-synonymous SNPs are located within the N-terminal putative coiled-coil domain. One of these SNPs (SNP254) results in the substitution of a charged residue (glutamate) by an uncharged amino acid (glycine). Charged residues are present at high percentages in coiled-coil domains and are thought to stabilize the domain through electrostatic interactions <ref type="bibr">(McFarlane et al., 2009)</ref>. Interestingly, a glutamate to glycine substitution in the winter type allele in Tapidor (in an otherwise unchanged, theoretical molecule) would reduce the probability of a coiled-coil domain in the N-terminal region from ;50% to &lt;5%, and the probability of a coiled-coil domain in the semi-winter type allele in Ningyou7 is also low (&lt;10%; predictions according to <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator25" type="software" xml:id="d825927b9e-software-55">COILS</rs> for a window size of 28 residues; <rs corresp="#d825927b9e-software-55" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/coils/ COILS_doc.html</rs>; data not shown). The glutamate residue is conserved between A. thaliana and the Tapidor allele and corresponds to the position with the most significant P value for SNP-trait association within the entire gene (0.005 in 2009; <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Furthermore, it was recently demonstrated that the N-terminal region including the coiled-coil domain of FRI in A. thaliana is required for protein-protein interaction with FRL1 as part of a transcriptional activator complex which establishes an active chromatin state of FLC <ref type="bibr">(Choi et al., 2011)</ref>. It is conceivable that the polymorphism within the N-terminal coiled-coil domain in BnaA.FRI.a contributes to functional differences between the segregating alleles in the TNDH population and may also play a part in natural variation at least in some environments.</p>

            <p>Postocclusive reactive hyperemia PORH was measured as described in Barwick et al. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Briefly, measurements were made with a moorVMS-LDF2 laser Doppler module and a VHP2 digit skin heater probe and needle probe (Moor Instruments, Axminster, UK). The laser probe was fixed to the plantar surface of the participant's hallux and heated to a thermoneutral 33&#176;C. Where access to the right hallux was precluded by injury or amputation, the left hallux was used. A 2.5 cm pneumatic cuff (Moor Instruments) was placed proximal to the probe. The followingautomated settings were used with the moorVMS-PRES pressure module (Moor Instruments): 3 min of baseline flux recording, inflation of the cuff to 220 mm Hg for 3 min, cuff deflation at maximum speed, and postocclusive flux recording for a further 4 min. All data were processed with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="c322bfae0c-software-0">moorVMS</rs> recording and analysis software V.<rs corresp="#c322bfae0c-software-0" resp="#annotator12" type="version">3.1</rs> (<rs corresp="#c322bfae0c-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Moor Instruments</rs>).</p>
            <p>The variables of peak expressed as a percentage of baseline (P%BL) and time to peak (TtP) were chosen due to their representation of the magnitude and temporal representation of the response and their established reliability. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Cardiac autonomic function assessment A Polar RS800cx heart monitor (Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland) was used to assess heart rate variability (HRV) as a measure of cardiac autonomic function. Participants completed a supine 5 min rest recording. The R-R interval tachogram was analyzed with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="c322bfae0c-software-1">Kubios HRV</rs> software (V.<rs corresp="#c322bfae0c-software-1" resp="#annotator12" type="version">2.1</rs>, Kuopio, 2012). Ectopic beats were removed using linear interpolation of previous and subsequent beats. Time and frequency domain parameters were assessed. Time domain measured included the SD of the N-N interval (SDNN) and the root mean square of the R-R intervals (RMS-SD). Frequency domain measures were divided by spectral power analysis into high (0.15-0.40 Hz), low (0.04-0.15 Hz), and very lowfrequency (0.00-0.04 Hz) powers with total power calculated as the sum of all powers. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> Variables were left continuous due to a lack of cut-off values established to indicate pathology.</p>
            <p>Statistical analysis was performed in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="c322bfae0c-software-2">Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences</rs> V.<rs corresp="#c322bfae0c-software-2" resp="#annotator12" type="version">22</rs> for Windows (<rs corresp="#c322bfae0c-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SPSS</rs>, Chicago, USA). Reliability of sensory neuropathy diagnosis was assessed with duplicate tests on a subset of 31 participants 7-14 days apart. &#954; Statistics were calculated and interpreted as per Landis and Koch 21 &#8805;0.75=excellent agreement, 0.4-0.75=fair to good agreement, and &lt;0.40=poor agreement. Reliability of continuous measures (HRV) was assessed with duplicate tests on a subset of 29 participants 7-14 days apart. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated and interpreted in accordance with Portney and Watkins: &gt;0.75=good, 0.50-0.75=moderate, and &lt;0.50=poor. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> Several hierarchical regression models were performed to determine how much the presence of sensory neuropathy and HRV predicted the variance in PORH variables (P%BL and TtP). One model for each of the four neurological variables ( presence of sensory neuropathy, RMS-SD, SDNN, and total power) was assessed. In each of the models, demographic variables identified as confounds (diabetes duration, gender, and age) were entered in level 1 and the neurological variable as the independent predictor variable in level 2. Non-normally distributed data were log transformed.</p>

            <p>In addition to the illustration of associated cell types and organelles along with the measured peptides, generalinformation about the protein is provided: Besides protein descriptions and full protein sequences, the corresponding Gene Ontology identifiers <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref> are listed linking to the Gene Ontology web site reporting full descriptions of the selected annotation. Furthermore, the annotations to each instance include PubMed references and general features such as active sites, motifs, domains or signaling sites derived from SwissProt <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). Since there may be several isoform entries corresponding to one SwissProt entry, we <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b50b8ceea7-software-simple-0">BLASTP</rs>-aligned the protein sequence of each SwissProt instance with that of the corresponding entry of the database used for matching the spectra to peptide sequence (usually the IPI). The main purpose of this extensive alignment approach is to derive the exact sequence positions of relevant protein features that are annotated in SwissProt within the protein sequences of the entry of the database used for MS identification.</p>
            <p>To allow the retrieval of legacy sub-databases that could not be included in the new concept, a link to the old database version is provided. This is the case for the organellar database <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref> as well as the red blood cell database <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref>, as both datasets are exclusively protein-based and therefore cannot be mapped to MAPU 2.0 due to the lack of peptide information. MAPU 2.0 is based on a modern and scalable software architecture, namely C# and the ASP.NET technology. This allows MAPU 2.0 to share class libraries, with PHOSIDA <ref type="bibr">(15)</ref>. The concepts and web applications of MAPU 2.0 and PHOSIDA are very similar and show that very distinct proteomic databases can be built using shared components.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, each chromosome is divided into 93 bins: on the left hand side the number of transcripts annotated in <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b50b8ceea7-software-simple-1">EnsEMBL</rs> is displayed. Selecting one of the bin boxes pops up the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b50b8ceea7-software-simple-2">EnsEMBL</rs> web page, showing a detailed view of the selected chromosome region. On the right hand side, the number of transcripts that have been detected in any of the uploaded projects is illustrated for each bin. Clicking on one of these bin buttons results in the listing of all identified gene transcripts along with the descriptions of the corresponding genes and exact localizations on the chromosome. Moreover, a link is provided for each gene transcript that connects to the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b50b8ceea7-software-simple-3">EnsEMBL</rs> homepage displaying the full annotation of that transcript. In addition to the general annotation of the given gene transcript, the pop-up <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b50b8ceea7-software-simple-4">EnsEMBL</rs> page will show all peptides that have been identified via the MAPU 2.0 DAS source <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref>. Thus, whenever a web user requests the information provided by MAPU 2.0 on <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b50b8ceea7-software-simple-5">EnsEMBL</rs>, the data included in the MAPU 2.0 database are illustrated via the DAS/Proserver system <ref type="bibr">(13)</ref>. Clicking on one of the illustrated peptides yields a report of all the cell types that contain the peptides for this gene transcript. In addition to the MAPU 2.0 DAS source, we have also established a PHOSIDA DAS source providing all phosphorylation sites that have been unambiguously identified (Class 1 sites) <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref>, but also phosphosites that lack precise identification within the phosphorylated peptide sequence due to insufficient fragment information in MS/MS (ambiguous sites).</p>

            <p>The crystallographers who determined the WWP1 structure described in detail its comparison with E6AP (3), and they produced several figures depicting superpositions carried out manually, similar to what <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-0">pFlexAna</rs> produces automatically. To our knowledge, there are currently no other computational tools that aim to automate such analyses.</p>
            <p>Our <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-1">pFlexAna (protein flexibility analyzer)</rs> web server aims at automatically detecting conformational changes between a pair of protein structures, without relying on sequence homology. Specifically, it detects regions exhibiting structural change, contrasted with regions exhibiting structural similarity. The <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-2">pFlexAna</rs> results can be viewed as indications of the endpoints of hypothesized molecular motions or mutation-induced conformational changes.</p>
            <p>To detect conformational changes in dissimilar proteins, we must first find structurally similar fragments (domains, sub-domains, etc.) in the proteins. <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-3">pFlexAna</rs> employs a statistical test to match core protein fragments that are structurally similar and determine the geometric transformations that align them. This statistical test of structural similarity has been shown to be effective in detecting many different types of conformational changes (4). <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-4">pFlexAna</rs> displays the protein structures superimposed according to each aligned fragment pair. The superimposed display highlights the discontinuity from the similar to the dissimilar regions of the proteins and aids visualization of the conformational changes that occur relative to the aligned fragment pair used as the basis for superposition. See <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> for a sample result. Furthermore, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-5">pFlexAna</rs> clusters the aligned fragment pairs into 'super-alignments', according to the similarity of geometric transformations that align them. The result is that the dominant conformational changes occur between the clusters, while the smaller conformational changes occur within a cluster.</p>
            <p>As a complementary approach, for cases with low sequence homology, one may attempt structural alignment i.e. matching the proteins based on structural similarity instead of sequence similarity. However, both rigid and flexible structural alignment methods focus on finding a single best fit between the protein structures, and may ignore small yet significant conformational changes. Consider, for example, the relatively simple case of a same protein in two conformations. Given the bound and unbound structures [PDB codes 3MBP (10) and 1LLS:A (11)] of the maltose-binding protein, two popular structural alignment methods, CE (12) and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-6">FATCAT</rs> (13), align the entire structures together without recognizing the hinge-like conformational change occurring between the two domains of the protein. FlexProt <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref>, on the other hand, requires the user to know the number of hinges in order to interpret its results. What we need in this case is a method that automatically detects the 'discontinuity' in structural similarity at the hinge due to the conformational change and matches the two domains on each side of the hinge separately. See <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> for a comparison between the results from <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-7">FATCAT</rs> and <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-8">pFlexAna</rs>. In general, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-9">pFlexAna</rs> aims to detect such conformational changes for two related, but different proteins. Furthermore, it tries to identify and group together those protein fragments that move in tandem.</p>
            <p>The <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-10">pFlexAna</rs> server takes as input two protein structures in PDB format, which may be uploaded or specified using PDB codes. The user may also specify chain identifiers or a restricted range of residues for each file. Finally, there are two optional parameters that the user may adjust. The parameter k is the desired number of clusters for groupingthe aligned fragments together, and is the noise parameter, which determines how strictly structural similarity is applied. For low -values, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-11">pFlexAna</rs> matches only fragments that are highly similar. For high -values, it also matches fragments with weak similarity and ignores small differences. Based on our experiences, -values between 0.2 and 0.4 work well for proteins with reasonably highsequence homology (40% or higher). For proteins that are even more distantly related, we find -values up to 0.8 to be useful as well, though this may lead to false positive matches in some cases.</p>
            <p>Output<rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-12">pFlexAna</rs> identifies pairs of fragments-one fragment from each protein-that show significant conformational similarity. They are listed in a table and grouped into clusters, according to the similarity of the geometric transformation that aligns the fragment pair. See <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> for an example. Two or more fragment pairs may move together and form a semi-rigid domain. By categorizing fragment pairs that are moving together versus moving independently, clustering helps to characterize conformational changes caused by domain movements or correlated motions.</p>
            <p>For each aligned fragment pair, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-13">pFlexAna</rs> provides a static cartoon of the proteins superimposed according to the aligned pair. This highlights the movement of the proteins with respect to the aligned regions. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-14">Jmol</rs> links are also provided so that the user may view the proteins from different angles. Finally, the transformed PDB coordinate files that align the second protein to the first are available for download and the transformation matrices used for alignment are provided. The same information is also provided for each cluster of aligned fragment pairs.</p>
            <p>To analyze the conformational changes between two protein structures, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-15">pFlexAna</rs> proceeds in two main steps. In the first step, it identifies pairs of fragments that are structurally similar. These fragment pairs serve as rigid cores for superimposing the two proteins and detecting conformational changes with respect to the cores. In the second step, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-16">pFlexAna</rs> clusters the aligned fragment pairs into 'super-alignments', according to the similarity of geometric transformations that align two fragments in a pair. The result is that the dominant conformational changes occur between the clusters, while the smaller conformational changes occur within a cluster. We now describe the two steps in greater detail below.</p>
            <p>To identify structurally similar fragment pairs,<rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-17">pFlexAna</rs> uses an all-against-all approach that effectively compares every contiguous fragment from one protein with that from the other. First, we match the residues of the two proteins by 'sliding' one protein against the other <ref type="figure">(Figure 4</ref>). For each sliding position, let P and P 0 represent the matched residues from the two proteins, respectively. We generate all contiguous fragments of P and P 0 and check their structural similarity by applying a reliable statistical test <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref>. Briefly, this test uses a Gaussian noise model to represent acceptable deviations in atomic coordinates between two putatively similar protein fragments. Two fragments are considered statistically different if their coordinates deviate too much according to the Gaussian model. We then assign to each residue a flexibility score that incorporates information from all fragment comparisons that involve this residue. A high score indicates greater rigidity. Finally, each pair of aligned fragments must pass the following filter: the fragments must consist entirely of residues whose flexibility scores are above a threshold, and they must be longer than a given minimum length. Intuitively, this filter ensures that such a pair of fragments and all subfragments contained in them are structurally identical up to statistical variations. The minimum length requirement is imposed to avoid accidental structural matches. One advantage of our method is that it highlights the genuine conformational changes by suppressing the spurious ones due to noise. More details on this method and its advantages are available in ref. <ref type="bibr">(4)</ref>. Since we perform anexhaustive comparison of all contiguous fragments in the two protein structures, our method can detect structurally similar fragments that are in opposite order along the protein sequences. After obtaining an exhaustive list of structurally similar fragment pairs, we need to resolve the conflicts among them. A conflict occurs if in the list of matched fragment pairs, a residue from one protein is matched with multiple residues from the other protein. In practice, we have found that biologically significant matches have much longer fragment length than the spurious ones due to accidental structural similarity. So we remove the conflicts in the list by preferring fragment pairs with longer length.</p>
            <p>Finally, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-18">pFlexAna</rs> hierarchically clusters the fragment pairs. The idea is to treat each structurally similar fragment pair as a point and divide these points into k clusters so that the dominant structural differences occur across clusters. To do this, we build a similarity graph. The vertices of this graph correspond to the fragment pairs obtained after conflict resolution. There is an edge between every two vertices, and the associated edge weight represents the similarity between the fragment pairs corresponding to the two vertices. Here, similarity is defined as the root mean square deviation (RMSD) for the best superposition when the two fragment pairs are combined. After constructing the similarity graph, we recursively remove from the graph the edge with the greatest weight and thus separate the most dissimilar fragment pairs, which represent the largest structural difference. We continue this edge removal process until the graph breaks into k connected components.</p>
            <p>The web server implementation of our method uses PHP for its front-end interface, C++ for back-end processing, and a Ruby daemon to interface the front and back ends. The output images are generated using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-19">PyMol</rs> <ref type="bibr">(15)</ref> and interactive displays of each alignment are provided using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-20">Jmol</rs> <ref type="bibr">(16)</ref>.</p>
            <p>We illustrate the results of <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-21">pFlexAna</rs> on several representative cases.</p>
            <p>The crystal structures of the E6AP and WWP1 ubiquitin ligases [PDB codes 1D5F:C (2) and 1ND7 (3)] display a striking example of domain movement <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>).<rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-22">pFlexAna</rs> finds six core regions of significant structural similarity between the proteins and successfully clusters them into two domains which move independently (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). These images are obtained directly from the web server, but annotated with an arrow and dotted ovals to draw attention to the domains that are aligned. The relative movement between the domains has been characterized as a 100 degree sweep with a 30 degree tilt <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref>. Superpositions, such as those shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, help to highlight the context of each protein region undergoing conformation change.</p>
            <p>The ubiquitin ligases have moderate sequence identity (&lt; 40%), but we have tested <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-23">pFlexAna</rs> on a range of protein pairs with low sequence identity such as the isomerase domain of glucosamine 6P synthase [1MOQ <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref>] and arabinose binding protein [8ABP <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>], which have 10% sequence identity. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows the alignments of 1MOQ and 8ABP. <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-24">pFlexAna</rs> finds two independent domains. Each aligned domain centers around a parallel b-sheet buried by a-helices. In this figure, each alignment is rotated for viewing down the plane of an aligned sheet. To see the magnitude of the domain movement, note that the N-terminal domain of 8ABP (magenta) appears in the upper-right of both views, and 1MOQ (orange) is dramatically shifted between the two alignments.</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-25">pFlexAna</rs> is particularly useful for proteins exhibiting domain moments, but applying it to proteins with more subtle conformational changes and without major domain movements can also be informative. In particular, we set parameter k = 1 when we expect only a single cluster corresponding to the aligned protein core. For example, <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> compares two PX domain proteins [1KMD <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref> and 1GD5 <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref>]. The N-and C-termini of the two proteins are conserved, but the loop region in between contains several insertions/deletions. Most structural alignment methods attempt to align these two proteins by superimposing their entire backbones globally. While this may be useful for some purposes, single global alignments may be skewed as they include the loop region. A more informative view of the evolutionary impact on conformational structure is shown by aligning only the conserved segments. On the PX domains, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-26">pFlexAna</rs> automatically finds the fragments of tightest similarity, distinct from the loop region, and it presents the clustered alignment result without skew from the inserted amino acids.</p>
            <p><rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-27">pFlexAna</rs> is a new tool for protein structure comparison. It detects and displays conformational changes in remotely related proteins, without relying on sequence homology. Our tests show that <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-28">pFlexAna</rs> helps in analyzing a wide variety of conformational changes. It can detect conformational changes in proteins with identical sequences or those with very low sequence similarity. It can detect dramatic domain movements as well as smaller, more subtle conformational changes.</p>
            <p>The output of <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-29">pFlexAna</rs> helps the analysis of conformational changes in several ways. <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-30">pFlexAna</rs> uses a reliable statistical test of structural similarity to demarcate the protein regions that undergo conformational changes. It also clusters the protein fragments that move in tandem. The clustering helps in finding domains comprised of fragments that are discontiguous and out of order along the sequences, e.g. in the case of the maltose-binding protein <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). Visualization of such information, provided in <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-31">pFlexAna</rs>'s output, helps the user to scan for hinge locations, active binding sites, domain movements, etc. For more detailed analysis, the user may use the quantitative information provided in <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-32">pFlexAna</rs>'s output, e.g. use the provided transformation matrix for alignment to compute the angle of bending at a particular hinge. <rs cert="0.9" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-33">pFlexAna</rs>'s output may also help users interested in predicting conformational motion. They may use the information that <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="e136915730-software-simple-34">pFlexAna</rs> provides as a starting point and combine it with other methods such as targeted molecular dynamics <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref>, where an MD simulation trajectory is 'directed' from an inital conformation towards an alternative target conformation.</p>

            <p>NTera2 cells (NT2) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured as directed.

RNA was isolated using the Aurum Total RNA Mini Kit which incorporates an on-column genomic DNA clearance step (Cat# 7326820, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), quantified with a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA) and stored at &#8722;80 &#8226; C. ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-in Mixes (Cat# 4456739, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA) were diluted and spiked into RNA samples which were then reverse transcribed using iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix as directed by the manufacturer (Cat# 1708849, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) to make stock cDNA samples which were stored at &#8722;20 &#8226; C.

            <p>Prior to conducting the full study, we completed a pilot study to confirm the accuracy of knee ROM measurements obtained using an electrogoniometer (SG150, Biometrics Ltd., UK), which was used as the criterion value for the evaluation of the measurement error of the universal goniometer. A standardized procedure was used to position the electrogoniometer for the recording of knee joint ROM positions. The electrogoniometer was attached to the right leg using double-sided tape, with the knee flexed to 60&#176;. The proximal point of attachment was localized 1 cm from the lateral epicondyle of the femur, along a line connecting the greater trochanter and the lateral epicondyle of the femur. The distal point of attachment was localized 1 cm from the head of the fibula, along a line connecting the head of the fibula and the lateral malleolus. The bony landmarks used as a reference for the localization of the electrogoniometer were identified by palpation and marked. A thin string was attached with tape between both pairs of landmarks (i.e., greater trochanter and lateral epicondyle of the femur; head of the fibula and lateral malleolus). The thin string was used as a guide to attach the electrogoniometer. Once the electrogoniometer was placed and secured, an elastic wrap was used to prevent slipping of the electrogoniometer during measurements, as well as to hide its position from the participants performing measurements using a universal goniometer. Reflective markers were then placed over the bony landmarks, namely the greater trochanter, lateral epicondyle of the femur, head of the fibula, and lateral malleolus to visualize their positions on digital images captured obtained by a two-camera system (B-CAM, DKH, Japan). Passive knee ROM was measured by one experimenter, from full extension to maximum flexion, with the experimenter taking care to maintain the knee motion in the sagittal plane, avoiding adduction/abduction and internal/external rotation motions of the hip as much as possible. The measurement was recorded by the two-camera system with the signals between the cameras and the electrogoniometer synchronized using a trigger switch. The knee joint position data obtained from the electrogoniometer and the imaging data captured by the cameras were analyzed using a motion analysis system (Frame-DIAS V, DKH, Japan). For the imaging data, the knee joint angle was defined as the angle formed by the line connecting the greater trochanter and the lateral epicondyle and the line connecting the head of the fibula and the lateral malleolus. Agreement between the imaging and electrogoniometer data was evaluated by simple linear regression, using the imaging data as the dependent variable and the electrogoniometer data as the independent variable. The level of agreement between the electrogoniometer and imaging data was high at knee flexion angles of 20&#176; to 90&#176; (y=0.960x, R 2 =0.998, p&lt;0.001). Therefore, we used this range of knee motion for the main experiment. Statistical analyses were performed with <rs corresp="#ba84c84697-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">IBM</rs> <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="ba84c84697-software-1">SPSS Statistics</rs> software (ver. <rs corresp="#ba84c84697-software-1" resp="#annotator20" type="version">23</rs>).</p>
            <p>The following variables were used in the analysis: level of proficiency, defined as the number of years since receiving basic instruction in goniometry measurement; measurement error; and measurement time. The means and standard deviations (SD) of the measurement error and measurement time were calculated for the proficiency level (1-6 years). Reproducibility of the end-point of knee ROM by the volunteer was evaluated for the first (60&#176;) and second (75&#176;) trials by calculating the mean and SD of the values recorded by the electrogoniometer. The absolute measurement error was calculated as the difference between the ROM measure of the electrogoniometer and the measure reported by the participants. The mean, SD and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the absolute error was calculated for each proficiency level. Split-plot analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the effect of proficiency level on the absolute measurement error and measurement time as dependent variables. A Bland-Altman analysis was performed to evaluate the presence or absence of systematic bias in the ROM measurements obtained using a universal goniometer. The differences between the measurements obtained with the electrogoniometer and the universal goniometer were plotted along the y-axis, with the mean of both measurements plotted along the x-axis. The mean difference (md), SD of the md (SD dif ), and 95% CI of the md were calculated to identify systematic (fixed) errors. A simple linear regression analysis was performed to identify possible proportional bias. The magnitude of the random error in measurement was evaluated by calculating the MDC at the 95% CI level (MDC 95 ) as follows: MDC 95 =1.96 SD dif . All statistical analyses were performed using <rs corresp="#ba84c84697-software-3" resp="#curator" type="publisher">IBM</rs> <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="ba84c84697-software-3">SPSS Statistics</rs> software (ver. <rs corresp="#ba84c84697-software-3" resp="#annotator20" type="version">23</rs>).</p>

            <p>Tissue assessments. The primary end point of the study was to determine the effects of treatment on tumour stroma including assessment of collagen content and structure and CAFs. In addition to study samples obtained from patients and mouse models, we also analysed a set of six samples from patients with untreated PDA and six samples from patients treated with conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Collagen analysis was assessed using collagen I primary rabbit antibody (1 : 100; Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA, USA) for 1 h at 37 1C and as secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1 : 200; Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Activated fibroblasts were determined with double staining using vimentin, as total fibroblasts marker (1 : 50; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and smooth muscle actin (SMA) as an activated fibroblast marker (1 : 100; DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). The secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1 : 200; Invitrogen) for vimentin and Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-mouse IgG (1 : 200; Invitrogen) for SMA. Sections were counterstained with DAPI (Invitrogen) and mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Samples were acquired using a laser scanning confocal microscope TCS-SP5 (AOBS) Leica (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) with two magnifications &#194; 20 HCX PL APO CS (0.7 NA) and &#194; 40 HCX PL APO CS (1.25 NA) oil immersion objectives.

Fibroblast quantification was performed with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="b9dd138652-software-simple-3">Definiens Developer XD</rs> Software (Munich, Germany). Detected cells were classified depending on the ratio between mean layer intensities of both, vimentin and SMA. Activated fibroblasts were considered when they co-expressed SMA and vimentin. We determined the fibroblast density index by adjusting the number of cells counted to the proportion of tumour fibrosis observed in the specimen (adapted from <ref type="bibr">Erkan et al, 2008)</ref>. The quantification was done in two different and representative fields (20 steps) for each sample. In the preclinical study, immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against mouse SPARC (R&amp;D Systems, MAB942, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9661).</p>

            <p>After the intervention, balance measuring equipment (Good Balance, Metitur, Finland) was used to quantitatively measure each subject's balance ability <ref type="bibr">5)</ref>. The balance test was performed by a physical therapist who had completed the course for the balance test method and was experienced in clinical practice for over three years. To measure balance function, the subject was instructed to stand on a triangle platform and maintain a symmetrical posture with the feet shoulder width apart. A visual fixed point was located in front of the subject to minimize head movements. The subject's arms were placed comfortably at the hip joints and the center of pressure (COP) was measured for 30 seconds in the standing posture with the eyes open. COP was measured three times and average values were calculated. The software also calculates several variables describing the quantitative aspects of individual's test behaviour, e.g. amount and speed of anterior-posterior and medial-lateral sway, amplitude of sway, the first moment of sway velocity (combined amplitude and velocity of the movement of the center of pressure), power spectrum analysis (FFT analysis) etc. Low score of anterior-posterior and medial-lateral sway implies excellent balance ability. The index of balance function score ranges between 0 and 100, and a higher score implies greater balance ability to perform the task. A reliable and valid measurement of the functioning of posture control mechanisms is a prerequisite for discovering the reasons for balance problems or evaluating the effects of treatment and rehabilitation.</p>
            <p>The mean and SD were calculated for each variable. Before the intervention, differences in the general characteristics of the experimental group were analyzed by descriptive statistics. Variables were compared before and after training within experimental group using paired sample t-tests.

            <p>Model 6.3 moves away from the experiment to assess whether senators' length of tenure affects their voting behavior. Controlling for tenure length is important because senators may be more supportive of the IMF because they serve longer terms than representatives, rather than because they have larger constituencies. I assess this alternative institutional argument via variation among senators with respect to TIME TO ELECTION. This variable measures the number of years between an IMF roll-call vote and a senator's next election. It ranges from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating that a senator is up for reelection later in the same year as the roll-call vote, and 5 indicates that the senator has 5 years remaining until her next election. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> The evidence from Model 6.3 supports the "larger constituency" hypothesis: the point estimate for TIME TO ELECTION is <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Interpreting interaction terms in non-linear models is not straightforward. For example, the direction and significance of the effect may be different for different observations <ref type="bibr">(Ai and Norton 2003)</ref>. Using the inteff command in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="d066f504bf-software-simple-0">STATA</rs>, I calculated the interaction effect correctly <ref type="bibr">(Norton et al. 2004)</ref>. This revealed that the interaction term SENATE * REP-AT-LARGE is not statistically significant at any level but positive for all observations. 19 Senators are divided into three classes for purposes of elections and every 2 years the members of one class-approximately one-third of the Senate-face election or reelection. Data on the class and election dates of senators are from Swift et al., Database of Congressional Historical Statistics.Bill and vote information obtained from the "Voteview" and the Library of Congress "Thomas" websites</p>

            <p>To determine the extent of Nodal signaling more rigorously, 40%-50% epiboly Tg(ARE:eGFP) embryos were stained for eGFP, ndr1, ndr2, lft1, and lft2 expression, sectioned, and quantitated <ref type="figure">(Figures 3A and 3B)</ref>. The expression of eGFP, ndr1, ndr2, and lft1 was limited to an average of about five cell tiers, whereas lft2 expression was detected in only two to three cell tiers from the margin. To confirm that these findings were not due to a lack of sensitivity of the WISH, we analyzed the expression of sox3, which is repressed by Nodal signaling in the marginTo corroborate the data obtained from the sections, we used a direct readout of the Nodal pathway, fluorescent immunostaining of whole-mount 50% epiboly embryos with an antibody against P-Smad2. For comparison, we also stained for P-Erk. Nuclear P-Smad2 staining was observed exclusively in the margin and, as expected, in a smaller domain than the P-Erk staining <ref type="figure">(Figure 3C)</ref>. To quantitate the size of the P-Smad2-positive domain, we imaged the embryos at the margin, used <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="e21df93f04-software-simple-0">MetaMorph</rs> software to generate normalized nuclear staining intensities, and measured the distance of each nucleus from the margin in control-and SB-505124-treated embryos. P-Smad2 staining above background was found up to five to six cell tiers (80-90 mm) from the margin in a steep gradient, which was abolished in SB-505124-treated embryos <ref type="figure">(Figures 3D,</ref> 3E, and S5B-S5D). The staining was strongest in the nuclei of cells nearest the YSL. Taken together with our observations from the Tg(ARE:eGFP) reporter line, these data demonstrate that Nodal signaling occurs in five to six cell tiers from the margin, closely mirroring the expression of the ligands.</p>
            <p>Whole-Mount Immunofluorescence and Quantification of P-Smad2 Staining Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight, dehydrated to 100% methanol, and stored at &#192;20 C until processing. For whole-mount immunofluorescence, embryos were rehydrated to PBS and incubated in cold acetone at &#192;20 C for 20 min. Blocking and antibody incubations were performed in 10% FBS and 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and washes were performed in PBS/1% Triton. The following primary antibodies were used: a-PSmad2/3 (8828; Cell Signaling Technology) and a-P-Erk (M8159; Sigma). Note that because of the lack of Smad3 at blastula stages, we solely detect P-Smad2 with the a-P-Smad2/3 antibody. DAPI was used to stain nuclei, and images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope. For quantification of P-Smad2 intensity in deep cells, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="e21df93f04-software-1">MetaMorph</rs> Software (<rs corresp="#e21df93f04-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Molecular Devices</rs>) was used to generate P-Smad2 to DAPI ratios from at least three single optical slices per embryo, in three individual DMSO or SB-505124 treated, 50% epiboly embryos. Care was taken not to select mitotic or overlapping nuclei or nuclei from the enveloping layer. To measure the distance of a nucleus to the margin, a line was drawn laterally at the vegetal edge of the margin, and the distance to the nucleus perpendicular to the margin was measured using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="e21df93f04-software-simple-3">MetaMorph</rs> Software. To normalize the staining intensity for each embryo, the average ratio of an area further than 11 cell tiers from the margin (&gt;165 mm) was subtracted from each measurement. The data were divided in 15 mm bins, representing the average size of a deep cell at 50% epiboly (unpublished data; <ref type="bibr">Dubrulle et al., 2015)</ref>. The averages of the binned data for each cell tier, comparing DMSO and SB-505124 treatment, were used for testing for statistical significant differences using paired t tests with a 95% confidence interval.</p>

            <p>In the 1995 Microsoft case, the Justice Department was seeking to protect competition in innovation as much as price competition. Protecting incentives for innovation is a common recent theme at the antitrust enforcement agencies. Another example occurred when two pharmaceutical producers, Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz, sought to merge in 1996. The FTC obtained a consent settlement requiring the merged firm (Novartis) to sell off one of the competing research and development efforts in genetic engineering to a third firm to protect competition in innovation. Moreover, in a new round of Microsoft litigation, the Justice Department is currently asking a court to determine whether Microsoft's integration of Internet browser software into <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ddf560d942-software-simple-0">Windows</rs> harms innovation and tends to create or maintain monopoly by excluding rivals selling browsers such as <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="ddf560d942-software-simple-1">Netscape</rs> (DOJ's view), or promotes innovation and competition by improving software design (Microsoft's position). <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The widely discussed possibility of network externalities-the benefit that users obtain when other customers use the same product, as with much computer software-raises the stakes for antitrust enforcers in discriminating between harmful and beneficial exclusionary practices. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The possibility of network effects increases the efficiency benefits of having a single standard in the marketplace, but it may also entrench a firm and so allow it to exercise market power in a more damaging way. In consequence, antitrust enforcement decisions may be ineffective unless they are made early in an industry's development, before a standard becomes so secure as to make an antitrust remedy impractical. Yet it may be hard to make reliable judgments before uncertainties about the consequences of the challenged conduct have been fully resolved in the marketplace.</p>

            <p>We used data from the National Prescribing Service (NPS) MedicineWise (formerly NPS Medicines Line), operated by clinical pharmacists of Mater Health Services, Brisbane, between September 2002 and June 2010. This call centre was available to consumers Australia-wide for medicine-related questions. Since data from our observational study were originally routinely collected as part of a health service without specific a priori research goals, research was conducted and reported in accordance with the REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely-collected health Data (RECORD) guideline, <ref type="bibr">17</ref> an extension of the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> Details of each call were captured on a standardised form and entered into a <rs corresp="#adf2a3dbf5-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Microsoft</rs> <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="adf2a3dbf5-software-0">Access</rs> database. These included demographics, enquiry type, relationship of caller to patient and motivation for calling. For each call, up to three generic medicines relating to the question were recorded and categorised by the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system of medicines. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Of the five ATC levels, we examined medicine classes at the ATC3 level, which labels medicines according to their pharmacological subgroup (eg, antihistamines-systemic), as well as at the ATC5 level, which identifies the chemical substance (eg, chlorpheniramine). Caller location was identified by postal code and grouped by state/territory and Accessibility/ Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA), a measure of the remoteness of areas from service centres. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> The relative population ratio was determined by dividing percentage of paracetamol calls from each ARIA category by percentage of population living in each ARIA category. Narrative for calls between January 2009 and June 2010 were also recorded electronically. Calls involving paracetamol in the question were extracted for analysis. Remaining calls were classified as 'rest of calls'. We excluded calls that only involved a voicemail request for Consumer Medicines Information (CMI) leaflets.</p>
            <p>We conducted a retrospective quantitative analysis on all paracetamol-related calls. Comparisons between paracetamol and 'rest of calls' were performed using a &#967; 2 test for categorical data. Each call was originally coded for 1 of 25 enquiry types. These were collapsed into seven question categories: 'efficacy' (indications for use, medicine comparisons, effectiveness for specific conditions or symptoms); 'interaction'; 'other safety' (side effects or cautions for use), 'administration' (dose, administration, formulation or storage issues); safety in 'pregnancy and/or lactation'; 'logistics' (availability or cost) and 'miscellaneous'. Enquiry types were compared by patient age groups and other life stages, for example, during pregnancy or breast feeding. Concurrent medicines included in paracetamol calls were also compared by age groups and a special population, pregnant women. A two-sided p-value &lt;0.05 was considered significant.

            <p>The HDL particle diameter was determined according to the method described by Perusse et al <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref>, by gradient gel electrophoresis using 4 to 25% polyacrylamide. After the gels had been equilibrated at 120 V for 60 min, electrophoresis was performed for each gel containing the serum sample diluted 1:2 with sample buffer (consisting of 40% sucrose, 0.06% EDTA-2Na, and 0.01% BPP), to a volume of 20 &#181;L. Each gel also contained thyroglobulin, ferritin, catalase, and lactate dehydrogenase as reference standards of known diameter. The gels were then electrophoresed at 15 V for 15 min, followed by migration at 70 V for 20 min, at 75 V for 16 h, and finally at 125 V for 8 h. The gels were then stained for lipid overnight with Sudan Black, and for reference standards with Coomassie Brilliant Blue for 45 min. They were then decolorified with ethanol and kept immersed in acetic acid. The decolorified gels were then scanned with an image scanner (Epson GT-6500: Seiko Epson Corporation, Nagano, Japan) and analyzed using an image processing and analysis program for Macintosh (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="ad1ffa9646-software-0">NIH Image</rs> <rs corresp="#ad1ffa9646-software-0" resp="#annotator5" type="version">1.61</rs>: <rs corresp="#ad1ffa9646-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">National Institutes of Health</rs>, United States). Migration distances were determined. The HDL particle diameter was then calculated by comparing the mobility of the sample with that of the three calibrated standards on each gel. A higher integrated HDL size indicated a greater proportion of "large" HDL particles, whereas a low HDL size suggested an increased prevalence of "small" HDL particles. Inter-and intra-assay coefficients of variation for the integrated HDL size assessed by this method were &lt; 3% (n=10) and &lt;2% (n=9), respectively.</p>

            <p>We used single turnover kinetics experiments under saturating enzyme conditions ([E] &gt; [S] &gt;&gt; K d ) to obtain a rate constant (k max ) that is not influenced by product release or product inhibition. This is important because TDG exhibits very slow product release and strong product inhibition, which dominates k cat values determined using steady-state kinetics <ref type="bibr">(19,32,33)</ref>. Experiments were collected at room temperature (23 C) in HEMN.1 buffer (0.02 M HEPES, 0.2 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 M NaCl). Experiments were initiated by adding concentrated TDG to buffered substrate, followed by rapid mixing. At various time points, aliquots were removed, quenched with 50% (v:v) 0.3 M NaOH and 0.03 M EDTA, and heated at 85 C for 15 min to cleave the DNA backbone at enzyme-produced abasic sites. The fraction product was determined by HPLC <ref type="bibr">(21,24)</ref>. The data were fitted to Equation (1) using nonlinear regression with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator16" type="software" xml:id="fe862776bc-software-simple-0">Grafit</rs> 6 (34):</p>
            <p>We also determined the maximal rate of product formation using kinetics experiments as described above, but with saturating substrate conditions ([S] &gt;&gt; K d , and [S] &gt;&gt; [E]) <ref type="bibr">(22,33)</ref>.

            <p>The equilibrium dissociation constants for TDG binding to TR-labeled DNA were determined by fitting the fluorescence anisotropy data to appropriate models using<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="fe862776bc-software-5">DynaFit</rs> <rs corresp="#fe862776bc-software-5" resp="#annotator5" type="version">4</rs> <ref type="bibr">(38,39)</ref>. The models and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="fe862776bc-software-simple-5">DynaFit</rs> scripts used for data fitting are given in the Supplementary Data. The fitted parameters included dissociation constants for one or two binding sites on the DNA, and anisotropy values for free DNA (r D ) and for 1:1 and 2:1 complexes with TDG (r ED and r EED ). In many cases, the data clearly indicate two nonequivalent binding sites. Model discrimination was also informed by the probability value of the Fisher's F-statistic, obtained from data fitting, where P &lt; 0.05 is considered significant. The reported parameters are derived from global fitting of at least two independent binding experiments. We determined the equilibrium dissociation constant for TDG binding to unlabeled DNA using equilibrium competition anisotropy experiments, where TDG binding to TR-labeled 16U F 11 was monitored in the presence of varying concentrations of unlabeled DNA.<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="fe862776bc-software-simple-6">DynaFit</rs> was used for global fitting of the data to a model involving one or two TDG binding sites for the unlabeled DNA and two binding sites for TR-labeled 16U F 11. A benefit of using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="fe862776bc-software-simple-7">DynaFit</rs> for the data presented here is that data fitting does not require an analytical equation, which could involve assumptions that are not compatible with experimental restraints. Indeed, the standard model for two nonequivalent binding sites assumes the species being monitored (DNA) is present at much lower concentration than the dissociation constant. This is not feasible for monitoring TDG binding to 16U F 11, because the minimal DNA concentration needed for sufficient sensitivity in the anisotropy experiment (0.5 nM) approximates the dissociation constant (K d1 = 0.6 nM, see below).</p>

            <p>The changes in HbA 1c from baseline to week 24 were assessed using ANCOVA, with treatment, study, and washout as fixed classification effects and baseline HbA 1c as a covariate. The same model with the addition of the covariate baseline FPG was used to assess changes in FPG from baseline to week 24. The reductions in HbA 1c within the linagliptin group were stratified into quartiles based on the change from baseline to week 24: ,0.1, 0.120.59, 0.6020.99, and $1.0% (,1.1, 1.126.5, 6.6210.8, and $10.9 mmol/mol). Effects on SBP after treatment within the linagliptin group were stratified into three categories based on the change from baseline to the last value on treatment: SBP decrease of .1.0 mmHg, stable SBP with only minimal changes between 21.0 and 11.0 mmHg, and SBP increase of .1.0 mmHg. The difference between percentage changes in geometric mean UACR across HbA 1c quartiles and SBP categories was tested using an ANOVA F-test to determine whether they were statistically significantly different.

            <p>Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure were measured with a noninvasive tail-cuff system (Softron BP-98A; Softron, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>. Hemodynamic measurement. Rats under deep anesthesia underwent hemodynamic measurement. A fluid-filled catheter was advanced from the right carotid artery into the LV, and the left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was measured. Histology and morphometric analysis. Paraformaldehyde (4%)-fixed hearts were bisected transversely at the midventricular level, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 4-mm sections. A single myocyte was measured with images captured from hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. The myocyte crosssectional area was assessed under 3400 magnification within the LV, and a mean was obtained by quantitative morphometry with automated image analysis (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator28" type="software" xml:id="ac88aac71e-software-2">Image-Pro Plus</rs>, Version <rs corresp="#ac88aac71e-software-2" resp="#annotator28" type="version">5.0</rs>; <rs corresp="#ac88aac71e-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Media Cybernatics</rs>, Houston, TX).</p>
            <p>Dark green-stained collagen fibers were quantified as a measure of fibrosis in Masson trichrome-stained sections. The collagen volume fraction (CVF) and perivascular collagen area/luminal area (PVCA/LA) were analyzed by quantitative morphometry with automated image analysis (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator28" type="software" xml:id="ac88aac71e-software-3">Image-Pro Plus</rs>, Version <rs corresp="#ac88aac71e-software-3" resp="#annotator28" type="version">5.0</rs>). CVF was calculated as reported previously <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref>. Perivascular collagen was excluded from the CVF measurement. To normalize the PVCA around vessels with different sizes, the perivascular collagen content was represented as the PVCA-to-LA ratio.</p>
            <p>Myocardial frozen sections (5 mm) were stained with Oil Red O (Sigma) for 10 min, washed, and then counterstained with hematoxylin for 30 s. A Nikon microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY) was used to capture the Oil Red O-stained tissue sections. Hydroxyproline analysis. The collagen content of myocardial tissue was determined by hydroxyproline assay <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref>. Tissue hydrolysate was detected by use of an ELISA kit (F15649; Westang Bio-Tech, Shanghai, China). Data were expressed as micrograms collagen per milligram dry weight, with the assumption that collagen contains an average of 13.5% hydroxyproline <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref>. Immunohistochemical staining. Paraffin sections underwent immunohistochemistry by a microwave-based antigen retrieval method. The sections were incubated with primary rabbit polyclonal anti-collagen I, anti-collagen III, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, and anti-interleukin (IL)-6 antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) overnight and then with a matching biotinylated secondary antibody for 30 min at 37&#176;C. Negative controls were omission of the primary antibody. The stained sections were developed with diaminobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin. The results were viewed under a confocal FV 1000 SPD laser scanning microscope (Olympus, Japan). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Total RNA was prepared with the TRIzol reagent (Gibco/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RT-PCR was performed using the following primers: b-actin, forward 59-AGA CCT TCA ACA CCC CAG-39 and reverse 59-CAC GAT TTC CCT CTC AGC-39; brain natriuretic protein, forward 59-GGG CTG TGA CGG GCT GAG GTT-39 and reverse 59-AGT TTG TGC TGG AAG ATA AGA3-9; TRB3, forward 59-TGA TGC TGT CTG GAT GAC AA-39 and reverse 59-GTG AAT GGG GAC TTT GGT CT-39; TNF-a, forward 59-CAC GCT CTT CTG TCT ACT GA-39 and reverse 59-GGA CTC CGT GAT GTC TAA GT-39; and IL-6, forward 59-ACC ACT TCA CAA GTC GGA GG-39 and reverse 592ACA GTG CAT CAT CGC TGT TC-39. Reactions were carried out on a real-time PCR thermocycler (IQ5 Real-Time PCR cycler; Bio-Rad), using SYBR green as fluorescence dye. Relative expression analysis involved the 2 2 &#9651;&#9651;CT method. Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was as described previously <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>. We used antibodies against TRB3 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), collagen I, collagen III, TNF-a, IL-6 (Abcam), phospho (p)-extracellular signal-regulated, followed by anti-IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. TRB3, collagen I, collagen III, TNF-a, and IL-6 protein levels were normalized to that of b-actin as an internal control and phosphospecific proteins to that of total protein. Gene silencing of TRB3. Sixty rats were randomized to receive TRB3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) or vehicle treatment. Gene silencing occurred immediately after the appearance of LV diastolic dysfunction. After 12 weeks of diabetes, both E/A and E9/A9 were ,1.0 as assessed by echocardiography in diabetic rats. Animals were then injected via the jugular vein with 2.5 3 10 10 plaque-forming units of an adenovirus harboring TRB3 gene (TRB3-siRNA) or a control empty virus (vehicle). Adenovirus transfer was repeated in 2 weeks. According to our present and previous studies (23), TRB3 level was increased in HF diet-fed and high fructose-fed rats. Previous studies have shown that insulin resistance was a hallmark of obesity <ref type="bibr">(24)</ref> and metabolic syndrome <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref>. In light of the interaction between TRB3 and insulin resistance, we also investigated the effect of TRB3-siRNA on HF diet-induced cardiac injury. Four weeks after the first adenovirus injection, rats were killed. The heart was excised and weighed. Statistical analysis. Values are presented as mean 6 SEM. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator28" type="software" xml:id="ac88aac71e-software-4">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#ac88aac71e-software-4" resp="#annotator28" type="version">16.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#ac88aac71e-software-4" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SPSS</rs>, Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analysis.

            <p>The lack of methods for tracking cells in 3D has been reported as a limiting factor, for instance in the context of immunoimaging <ref type="bibr">(Cahalan and Parker, 2008)</ref>. Despite the well-established protocol to capture microglia, innate immune cells in the central nervous system, in 3D using two-photon microscopy following the seminal works by <ref type="bibr">Nimmerjahn et al. (2005)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Davalos et al. (2005)</ref>, motility analysis has been performed by (and limited to) manual estimations derived from 2D projections <ref type="bibr">(Davalos et al., 2008)</ref> in the numerous studies following these protocols. In fact, tracking microglia cells is complicated by several aspects. Microglia tightly contact specific brain structures in their resting state <ref type="bibr">(Wake et al., 2009)</ref>, often making it difficult to clearly separate them from their surroundingWhile the red cell remains in resting state, the green cell is activated through an induced injury and migrates along a trajectory (orange line, trajectory obtained by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-0">ct3d</rs>; blue line, trajectory obtained from manual annotation) toward a site of injury (purple dot); see Supplementary Video 1 for a rendered animation of the same data.</p>
            <p>We implemented our algorithm in the publicly available <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-1">ct3d</rs> software package, which is accompanied by the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-2">at3d</rs> graphical user interface. In terms of applying our algorithm, this article focuses on evaluating the performance of our cosegmentation-based approach for 3D cell tracking, leaving colocalization studies as a future direction. Cell tracking performance is evaluated both on two-photon live cell imaging data displaying zebrafish microglia in vivo, and on synthetically generated data that allow to determine the algorithm's accuracy based on the ground truth the synthetic data were generated from.</p>
            <p>Filtering results: as for most segmentation and tracking approaches, the results obtained from the steps described above has a tendency toward overdetection, i.e. detecting segments that result from image noise rather than cells. To filter out those segments, we utilize life span filtering, i.e. we filter out all cells whose identity can be traced across less than a certain minimum number of frames. This cell filter, along with several other ways to eliminate cells with unsuitable size or volume features, follows corresponding features of the <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator23" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-3">Celltrack</rs> software <ref type="bibr">(Sacan et al., 2008)</ref> for 2D cell tracking; for<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-4">ct3d</rs>, they are implemented in the graphical user interface of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-5">at3d</rs> tool shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.</p>
            <p>&#8226; Alternative matching schemes: one class of cell tracking approaches is based on computing bipartite matchings between segmentations of individual time frames. As bipartite matchings may not capture events such as cell division or cell fusion, recent works such as <ref type="bibr">Padfield et al. (2009)</ref> introduced alternative matching schemes that are more flexible. Truly generalizing bipartite matchings, tree assignments can be seen as such alternative matching scheme. They are particularly interesting for cell tracking, as they may capture events such as cell division, cell fusion or cells entering the scene. See Supplementary Video 4 for synthetic data displaying a simplistic simulation of a cell division tracked by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-6">ct3d</rs>.</p>
            <p>We implemented component trees, tree-assignments and the complete cell tracking algorithm, in C++ using <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator23" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-3">lp_solve</rs> <rs corresp="#b27b28bf20-software-3" resp="#curator" type="version">1</rs> for solving both the tree assignment and the weighted bipartite matching (integer) linear programs, all of which is compiled in the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-9">ct3d</rs> command line tool. Cell tracking results can be further explored using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-10">at3d</rs>, which allows the user to select and extract specific cells identified by the cell tracking procedure, and derive their motility parameters such as velocity and deformation. The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-11">at3d</rs> tool is implemented using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-12">qt</rs> framework for graphical user interfaces. Input and output of image series is designed to be compatible with other visualization software, most notably <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-13">v3d</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Peng et al., 2010)</ref> for producing rendered visualizations of the output.</p>
            <p>We evaluated our algorithm on two types of data. First, we applied it to an in vivo time-lapse sequence of 3D two-photon images of zebrafish midbrain, displaying the motility of microglia; second, we applied <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-14">ct3d</rs> to synthetically generated data for quantifying the accuracy of our cell tracking results.</p>
            <p>Evalutation on in vivo data was accomplished by comparison with manually annotated trajectories of specific microglia in three datasets. Note that manual annotation is limited to trajectories, whereas boundaries of the cell volumes are almost impossible to obtain in 3D, beside systematic problems with manual annotations <ref type="bibr">(Huth et al., 2010)</ref>. Hence, we additionally created synthetic ground truth data to further evaluate the performance of our method. We followed the procedure used in <ref type="bibr">Dufour et al. (2005)</ref>, generating (noise perturbed) elliptical objects of average intensity I o above Poisson distributed background noise of intensity I b . In addition to the procedure from <ref type="bibr">Dufour et al. (2005)</ref>, we created perturbed images with different types of background inhomogeneities, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>: in a second set of data, we introduced a multiplicative vignetting effect to the data, following the vignetting model by <ref type="bibr">Kang and Weiss (2000)</ref> under different focal lengths f and off-axis illumination parameters &#945;. In a third set of data, we introduced an additive linear gradient along the x-axis of different slopes &#946;. Each time series consists of 20 time frames, each of size 200&#215;200&#215;40 pixels. On these data, we ran <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-15">ct3d</rs> with size cutoffs &#952; min = 500 and &#952; max = 5000, and a single-node cutoff of 200 pixels. In the resulting sequences, all cells whose identity could be traced through the complete sequence were kept, while all other cells were discarded using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-16">at3d</rs> tool.</p>
            <p>Our results on the synthetically generated image sequences are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> and indicate that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-17">ct3d</rs> is highly robust against different types and intensities of background inhomogeneities. The results suggest that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-18">ct3d</rs> has a tendency to identify components slightly (about 10%) larger than the actual objects, as can also be seen in the sample output in Supplementary Video 3. This is a natural consequence of pruning the component trees, where the vertex that would perfectly represent an object is unlikely to be part of the pruned tree. This effect can be reduced by smaller choice for the single-node cutoff parameter &#963; at the cost of higher computation time.</p>
            <p>Running times varied between roughly 4 and 6 min, with an average of 303.42 s, for completely tracking one dataset. The <ref type="bibr">(Kang and Weiss, 2000)</ref>. The dashed box indicates the position of the 1D section displayed in the lower part. Right: same setting with the background perturbed by an additive linear gradient. In both instances, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-19">ct3d</rs> yields reliable tracking results (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). majority of running time was spent on constructing the component trees and computing the overlap weights (14.23 s on average per time frame), whereas each tree assignment required less than one second on average; the pruned component trees typically comprised a few dozens of vertices.</p>
            <p>As a reference algorithm to compare against the performance of<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-20">ct3d</rs>, we computed a segmentation of each time frame using the active contour approach by <ref type="bibr">Chan and Vese (2001)</ref>, 2 which is a wellestablished and state-of-the-art representative of the large family of level set methods. As shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, this method works highly accurate in the absence of background inhomogeneity while getting less reliable with increasing levels of background inhomogeneity, as can be expected due to the involvement of a global background model. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows a result obtained from our tracking algorithm on a time series of microglia images measured as described above. We reduced resolution by half, so that the resulting width and height varied between 146 and 250 pixels, while the depth ranged between 14 and 66 layers for each time frame; each time series comprised 30-80 time frames. Gray scale resolution was reduced from 16 bit to 8 bit. We applied <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-21">ct3d</rs> using parameters &#952; min = 200, &#952; max = 10 000 and a single-node cutoff of 200 pixels; the resulting pruned component trees contained 69 vertices on average, ranging between 40 and 168 vertices. Running times varied between roughly 2 and 10 min, with 471 s on average.</p>
            <p>Under the given experimental protocol, the phenomenon of overdetection, i.e. the recognition of segments that are not microglia, is inevitable. This is due to the limited specificity of the apoE-GFP gene, which is also expressed in cells other than microglia in the surrounding tissue, often at comparably high levels as in microglia. Yet, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-22">ct3d</rs> identifies microglia as segments that can be visually distinguished from non-microglia segments by a human observer due to their characteristic shape or motion patterns. The <rs cert="0.9" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-23">Ct3d</rs> graphical user interface of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-24">at3d</rs> tool (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>) allows to manually eliminate false positive cells from tracking results by different filtering and visual selection functions similar to those provided by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-25">Celltrack</rs> for 2D time-lapse sequences. The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-26">at3d</rs> tool also allows to manually correct for the occasionally observed events of oversegmentation, i.e. one microglia being recognized as two segments. We used <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-27">at3d</rs> to eliminate non-microglia from all six datasets and correct oversegmentation in individual frames. We were able to reconstruct trajectories of all relevant microglia that can be visually identified in the original datasets; only one dataset was affected by a sudden 'frameshift', i.e. the sample changing its distance to the camera in the z direction, leading to interrupted trajectories at the corresponding time frame. In few other cases, the trajectory of a microglia was interrupted in individual frames, which we could correct using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-28">at3d</rs>. Examples of the final results are given in Supplementary Videos 1 and 2.</p>
            <p>In order to quantitatively evaluate the quality of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-29">ct3d</rs> results on in vivo microglia data, we compared <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator23" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-30">ct3d</rs> trajectories with manual annotations. To this end, we selected four microglia from four different datasets and annotated their trajectories manually using the 3D polyline markup feature of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-31">v3d</rs> software. The root mean square distance between the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-32">ct3d</rs> and the manual trajectories turned out to be 2.9 voxels, 5.5 voxels, 2.6 voxels and 5.4 voxels, respectively, in the four different datasets. These deviations can be considered relatively small in relation to the cell diameters, which were measured as 22.8, 22, 19.6 and 44.3 voxels, respectively.</p>
            <p>We have presented a novel approach to tracking cells in 3D time-lapse microscopy image sequences, based on the concepts of component trees and cosegmentation. We demonstrate that this approach is robust against the numerous challenges imposed by images measured in an in vivo environment, and allows to identify microglia and their motion patterns in zebrafish neural tissue when combined with the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-33">at3d</rs> annotation tool. In a quantitative evaluation, we show that our approach is robust against different types of background inhomogeneities. This suggests that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-34">ct3d</rs> and<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-35">at3d</rs> are potentially useful for in vivo imaging studies investigating other aspects than just microglia motility. In its current formulation, our cosegmentation approach relies on the assumption that the area occupied by an object overlaps between two consecutive time points. While this may not be satisfied in all cell tracking problems [e.g. when tracking centrosomes <ref type="bibr">(Jaensch et al., 2010)</ref>], it is a reasonable assumption for many immunoimaging-related studies.</p>
            <p>To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that can identify and track microglia in live cell imaging time series. In most cases, obtaining reliable trajectories still requires manual post-processing of the output. The most notorious difficulties certainly are the complex morphology-their deformation patterns, irregular shapes and interaction with the surrounding-as well as the unspecificity of the fluorescent markers available. In this light, our approach constitutes significant progress in the sense that it has sufficient sensitivity to separate microglia form their surrounding. Yet, a fully automated approach remains a major and certainly non-trivial challenge. A first step in this direction might be the combination with level-set based approaches as utilized for 2D cellBottom: quantitative comparison of trajectories obtained by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-36">ct3d</rs> and the active contour approach from <ref type="bibr">Chan and Vese (2001)</ref>. In general, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-37">ct3d</rs> could identify the annotated cells in all time frames (columns # Frames). The root mean square distance to the annotated trajectory measures a fraction of the diameter of the annotated cell (columns cell and RMS), while the Chan-Vese algorithm missed varying numbers of cells or failed completely (last column). For the Chan-Vese results, a parameter set was optimized for dataset (a). This parameter set (&#181; = 1, &#957; = .5, &#955; 1 = .2, &#955; 2 = 5) was also applied to datasets (b) to (d). While for dataset (a), the result is comparable to <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator23" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-38">ct3d</rs>, the annotated cell was identified in only 29 out of 49 time frames in (b). In datasets (c) and (d), the annotated cell could not be identified at all using these parameters. See Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure</ref> tracking by <ref type="bibr">Nath et al. (2006)</ref> that might yield more accurate cell boundaries in some cases. Yet, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="b27b28bf20-software-simple-39">ct3d</rs> promises to be a key tool for further studying open questions regarding microglia, such as to determine if and how glia and microglia share the task of finding and removing apoptotic neurons from the vertebrate brain <ref type="bibr">(Peri and N&#252;sslein-Volhard, 2008)</ref>.</p>

Impedance cardiography signals were recorded via a Hutcheson Impedance Cardiograph (Model HIC-3000, Bio-Impedance Technology, Chapel Hill, N.C., USA) using a tetrapolar band-electrode configuration. The electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded from the Hutcheson Impedance Cardiograph using disposable ECG electrodes.

            <p>supplemental methods in the online appendix available at http://dx.doi.org/ 10.2337/db07-1751). Whole-blood and plasma measurements. Total white blood cell number and differential counts were assessed by standard techniques (ACP Diagnostic Lab, University of California, San Diego). We measured plasma insulin by radioimmunoassay (Linco Research) and determined free fatty acids by colorimetric assay (Wako). Plasma cytokines were measured by the core laboratories of the Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Consortium (University of California, Los Angeles; LINCOplex assay for Mouse Cytokines, http://www.derc.med.ucla.edu/core.htm). Plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured by enzymatic methods using an automated bichromatic analyzer (Abbot Diagnostics). All of these measurements were performed on 11 wild-type and 9 &#9251;4(Y991A) mice for high-fat diet and 6 wild-type and 5 &#9251;4(Y991A) mice for chow diet <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. Histochemistry. Adipose tissue was fixed overnight in 10% formaldehyde, dehydrated in ethanol bath, and paraffin-embedded. Sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) for observation of adipose tissue structure. Pancreas isolation and determination of islet area. Pancreata were isolated and fixed in 4% formalin overnight. Paraffin sections were generated and stained with H-E. Pictures were taken of H-E-stained pancreas sections, and the area of Langerhans islets and the total area of the pancreas were measured using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="def90e121a-software-0">ImageJ</rs> software (<rs corresp="#def90e121a-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">NIH</rs> freeware). Islet area was depicted as percentage of total pancreas area. Sections of four to seven mice per group and at least six different pancreas areas per mouse were analyzed for statistical significance using unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. P values &#1021;0.05 were considered significant. Bone marrow transplantation. We injected bone marrow obtained from wild-type and &#9251;4(Y991A) mice (4 &#1003; 10 6 cells) through the tail vein into male C57BL/6 (4 months) and &#9251;4(Y991A) (4 -6 months) mice that had been irradiated (10 Gy) 4 h before. Mice were allowed 4 weeks for reconstitution of donor marrow, which we verified by PCR <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>. Isolation of stromal vascular cells. Epidydimal fat pads were minced in PBS and digested with collagenase (Roche) and DNase I (Sigma) for 1 h at 37&#176;C. Suspensions were then filtered through a 100-m nylon cell strainer and then spun at 1,000g for 10 min. The preadipocyte/adipocyte-enriched fraction was removed. Isolated stromal vascular cells were resuspended in red blood cell lysis buffer (10 mmol/l KHCO 3 , 150 mmol/l NH 4 Cl, and 0.1 mmol/l EDTA, pH 8) for 5 min at room temperature. Cell suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 500g, and stromal vascular cells were resuspended in PBS at 10 6 cells/100 l. Flow cytometry. Cells were harvested from WAT, peripheral blood, and bone marrow and incubated in Fc blocker (rat anti-mouse CD16/32) for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-Ly-6G (1/200) and phycoerythrin (PE)-7/4 (1/50) (BD Biosciences/ PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Negative control staining was performed with FITC-rat IgG2a/k and PE-rat IgG2a. Cell staining was analyzed with FACScan flow cytometer using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="def90e121a-software-1">CellQuest</rs> software (<rs corresp="#def90e121a-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">BD Biosciences Systems</rs>). Cell migration assay. Cell migration was assayed in a modified Boyden chamber system using a 24-well transwell plate (8-m pore size; Corning) coated with 5 g/ml VCAM-1 (R&amp;D Systems). Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (R&amp;D Systems) was added in the lower chamber at 1 nmol/l. Cells harvested from wild-type or &#9251;4(Y991A) bone marrow were grown for 5-7 days in the presence of granulocyte macrophage-colonystimulating factor (5 l of 0.1 mg/ml stock solution). Bone marrow-derived macrophages (2 &#1003; 10 4 ) were kept in suspension in 1% serum containing medium for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then added to the top chamber and incubated overnight at 37&#176;C. Filters were fixed and stained with crystal violet, and migrated cells in the lower chamber were enumerated. RNA isolation and RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from WAT using RNeasy Lipid Tissue kit (Qiagen). RT-PCRs were carried out as described in the online appendix <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref>. Statistical analysis. Means and SEs were calculated for all dependent measures. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using the one-or two-tailed Student's t test. Significance was set at P &#1349; 0.05. For <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>B, change scores for the chow diet and high-fat diet data were determined using the total area under the curve (AUC) <ref type="bibr">(21)</ref>.</p>

            <p>This cross-sectional descriptive analytic study was based on 67 women in the age range of 36 to 92 years old who were referred to the Radiology Department of Mashhad Dental School. All of them had a panoramic radiography in their orders and none of the participants was known to have any prior fracture and systemic disease that would affect bone metabolism (chronic renal osteodystrophy, hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, gastrointestinal disease, paget's disease or rheumatoid arthritis). They were not using specific drugs or hormones (corticosteroids, cyclosporine, heparin, estrogen, progesterone, androgen and excess thyroid hormone). The data regarding age and BMI (body mass index) was obtained by questionnaire. All the panoramic radiographs were taken with PM 2002 CC apparatus (Planmeca Oy, Asentajankatu 6, 00880 Helsinki, Finland) by a single operator (AB). The position of the head was standardized as much as possible and also the exposure factors (kVp, mA) were regulated for each patient. To have similar density and contrast in all radiographs, we used both AGFA Dentus panoramic film (Heraeus Kulzer, Belgium) and Kodak screens (Kodak Lanex Regular Screen, Eastman Kodak Company, USA). Processing of the films was automatically performed by <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d35b6dbf9c-software-0">Pro- tec processor</rs> (<rs corresp="#d35b6dbf9c-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">PROTEC medical systems</rs>, Stuttgart, Germany). For examination of the bone mineral density, DXA (Dual Energy Xray Absorptiometry) scans were performed with Osteocore 2 (MEDILINK, France). This technique is widely accepted as the "gold standard" method of clinical bone mineral measurements <ref type="bibr">[9,10]</ref>. DXA itself is subject to some minor inaccuracy in BMD measurement <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. Precision of DXA ranges from 0.55 to 5% [11]. Sixty-seven panoramic radiographs were analyzed for MCI, MI and PMI. According to Jowitt et al <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>, "MCI is classification of the appearance of the mandibular inferior cortex distal to the mental foramen, which includes the following criteria: C1: The endosteal margin of the cortex is even and sharp on both sides of the mandible. <ref type="figure">(Fig 2)</ref>. All the measurements were made in millimeters (0.1 mm variation) with calipers by the same investigator (AB). The indices were measured bilaterally and the mean was recorded for each patient. When only one foramen was visible, the measurements were done only on that side <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. The information on age and BMD statuses of the patients was blinded to the examiner in order to eliminate information bias. Afterwards we gave the patients their radiographs and referred them to Toos Bone Densitometry Center for BMD testing. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients to carry out bone densitometry as a part of the study on osteoporosis. BMD testing was per-The endosteal margin has semilunar defects (resorption cavities) with cortical residues one to three layers thick on one or both sides. C3: The endosteal margin consists of thick cortical residues and is clearly porous.Since the acquired AZ, sensitivity, and specificity were low in each cutoff threshold, we used several cutoff points to determine the sensitivity and specificity.</p>

            <p>Interventions were placed into natural groupings decided before inspection of the results and agreed with clinical experts: 1. more supported (six or more contacts, or 6 or more weeks in duration), 2. less supported (fewer than six contacts or fewer than 6 weeks in duration). Meta-analyses were performed using a random effects model where studies were judged appropriately homogeneous. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic. All continuous data were presented using a mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and time to event outcomes were presented as hazard ratios (HRs) to account for varying lengths of follow-up. Follow-up time was converted to weeks. The results of the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) were multiplied by -1 so that positive differences equated to improved HRQoL. Where HRs were not reported, methods by Parmar et al <ref type="bibr">18</ref> and Perneger <ref type="bibr">19</ref> were used. Rates of admissions and ED visits (ie, where patients could have multiple events) were calculated under the assumption that all patients in both arms were followed up for the duration of the study and that the rates were constant over time.

            <p>Forty 3-month-old intact Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Research Unit, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. They were acclimatized at the local vivarium for one week (room temperature, 12-hour light/dark cycle). The rats were housed singly in plastic cages with free access to tap water and standard rat chow (Gold Coin, Port Klang, Malaysia). They were stratified into five groups using random numbers generated by statistical software. Orchidectomy was performed in the orchidectomized, AnTT, and testosterone groups. A shamoperated group underwent similar surgical treatment but their testes were not removed. The baseline group was sacrificed without undergoing any surgical treatment or intervention. The AnTT group received AnTT daily (60 mg/kg body weight, oral gavage) for 8 weeks, while the other groups received an equal volume of the olive oil vehicle. The testosterone group received weekly testosterone enanthate injections (7 mg/kg body weight, intramuscularly) for 8 weeks while the other groups received an equal volume of the peanut oil vehicle. Treatment was initiated a week after orchidectomy. The weight of each rat was monitored weekly using a digital scale (Tanita Model 1,144, Tokyo, Japan) and recorded to the nearest 1 g. At the end of the treatment period, the rats were euthanized using diethyl ether (HmbG Chemicals &#174; , Hamburg, Germany), after which their femoral and tibial bones were harvested. After the soft tissue was removed, the bones were either stored in 10% formalin solution for histomorphometric and &#956;CT evaluation, or at -70&#176;C for study of gene expression. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the animal ethics committee at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (Code FP/FAR/2012/IMA/18-July/445-July-2012-April-2014).Contouring was performed using a semiautomated method to select the trabecular region. Three-dimensional reconstruction and evaluation were performed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f8c57aa0b9-software-1">Scanco</rs> software (<rs corresp="#f8c57aa0b9-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Scanco Medical</rs>) to measure the following bone parameters: trabecular bone volume, trabecular number, trabecular separation, trabecular thickness, structural model index, and connectivity density.</p>
            <p>The region assessed was the secondary spongiosa in the metaphyseal region, which is 3-7 mm from the lowest point of the growth plate and 1 mm from the lateral cortex. Structural parameters were investigated by an automated method using an image analyzer (<rs corresp="#f8c57aa0b9-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">MediaCybernetics</rs> <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f8c57aa0b9-software-2">Image Pro-Plus</rs>, Rockville, MD, USA). Dynamic parameters were investigated using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse 80i, Tokyo, Japan) and measured manually using a Weibel grid. The structural parameters measured included trabecular bone volume, thickness, number, and separation. Dynamic parameters measured included single-labeled surface, double-labeled surface, mineralizing rate, mineral apposition rate, and bone formation rate.</p>
            <p>Distribution of the data was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test and all data were found to be normally distributed. Oneway analysis of variance, with either Tukey's or Dunnett's T3 as the post hoc test, was used to detect significant differences in the variables of interest between the study groups. All data are presented as the mean and standard error of the mean. P-values &#57388;0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

            <p>Participants were prepared for polysomnographic sleep monitoring using standardized techniques <ref type="bibr">34</ref> including six EEG sensors to measure brain wave activity placed according to the international system for electrode placement, <ref type="bibr">35</ref> two eye sensors to record horizontal eye movement (electrooculogram), and chin and tibialis anterior electromyogram sensors to assess muscle activity. Physiological signals were recorded using Nihon Kohden equipment (Foothill Ranch, CA, USA). Other instruments included a nasal airflow sensor, comfortable belts around the thorax and abdomen to monitor respiratory effort, a finger probe to assess pulse oximetry, and a microphone to monitor snoring. Each study session was digitally video recorded. The sleep records were scored according to standardized scoring criteria. <ref type="bibr">36</ref> The outcome measures of interest are as follows: TST, SE, time spent in stage N1, stage N2, stage N3, and stage R, and percent sleep period time spent in stage N1, stage N2, stage N3, and stage R. For data analysis, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="eb7c332ca4-software-0">SPSS</rs> version <rs corresp="#eb7c332ca4-software-0" resp="#annotator2" type="version">20.0</rs> was used to perform all statistical analysis, and alpha was set at 0.05. Descriptive statistics were calculated. The data were analyzed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test and Skewness and Kurtosis test, as well as Box plots and normal Q-Q plots. Independent t-tests were used to compare the sleep parameters of the individuals with stroke with the control participants when the assumption of normality was satisfied. Effect sizes were calculated as Cohen's d values. Because this is a pilot study, data are presented without correction for multiplicity. Due to the sex difference in the stroke sample, linear regression was used to study if sex predicts the outcome measure of interest after controlling for age which can be a confounding factor for change in sleep parameters. An exploratory analysis was performed using independent t-tests to compare the sleep characteristics and descriptive characteristics of individuals with left-sided MCA lesions (n=7) to those with right-sided MCA lesions (n=9). Alpha was set at 0.05.</p>

            <p>The opposite situation occurs when all cross-sectional units are assumed to be neighbours of each other and are given equal weights. In that case all off-diagonal elements of the spatial weights matrix are w ij 01. Since the row and column sums are N &#193; 1, these sums diverge to infinity as N goes to infinity. In contrast to the previous case, however, (N &#193; 1)/N01 instead of 0 as N goes to infinity. This implies that a spatial weights matrix that has equal weights and that is row normalized subsequently, w ij 01/(N(1), must be excluded for reasons of consistency. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> summarizes a family of eight linear spatial econometric models, among which are the non-spatial model in (1) on the right-hand side and the Manski model in (2) on the left-hand side. Each model to the right of the Manski model can be obtained from that model by imposing restrictions on one or more of its parameters. The kinds of restrictions are reported alongside the arrows in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.Some of the models recorded in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> are well known and frequently used in applied research, while other models are not. LeSage &amp; Pace (p. 32) denote the model with a spatially lagged dependent variable (WY) and a spatially autocorrelated error term (Wo) by the term SAC, though without pointing out what this acronym is standing for. Since <ref type="bibr">Kelejian &amp; Prucha (1998)</ref> have been the main advocates of this model, it is therefore renamed the Kelejian&#193;Prucha model in this paper. The model with a spatially lagged dependent variable (WY) and spatially lagged independent variables (WX) has been introduced by <ref type="bibr">Anselin (1988)</ref> and is labelled the spatial Durbin model. A model with spatially lagged independent variables (WX) and a spatially autocorrelated error term has hardly been used in the literature. LeSage &amp; Pace (pp. 41&#193;42) label it the spatial Durbin error model. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> seems to indicate that the best strategy to test for spatial interaction effects is to start with the most general model, i.e. the model that includes a spatially lagged dependent variable, spatially lagged independent variables, and a spatially autocorrelated error term simultaneously. However, as <ref type="bibr">Manski (1993)</ref> notes, at least one of the K'2 interaction effects must be excluded, because otherwise the parameters are unidentified. To verify this, I carried out a simple Monte Carlo experiment generating Y by (2a) and (2b), one X variable drawn from a uniform distribution on the interval [&#193;1,1], r 0 a 0 b 0 u 0 l 0 0:25; s 2 00.01, N060, and a spatial weights matrix W corresponding to the corners of the seams in a soccer ball (in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="c11972c006-software-simple-0">Matlab</rs> known as the Bucky Ball). Based on 1,000 repetitions, I found biases in the parameter estimates of the endogenous and exogenous interaction effects (r and u, respectively) that may be as great as 0.0423 and, related to that, standard deviations that may be as great as 0.2677. These results corroborate <ref type="bibr">Manski's (1993, p. 534)</ref> finding that there are no technical obstacles to estimating a model with interaction effects among the dependent variable, the independent variables and the disturbance terms, but that the parameter estimates cannot be interpreted in a meaningful way since the endogenous and exogenous effects cannot be distinguished from each other.</p>
            <p>One of the merits of LeSage &amp; Pace's book is that they offer another criterion to select models, namely the Bayesian posterior model probability. Whereas tests for significant differences between log-likelihood function values, such as the LRtest, can formally not be used if models are non-nested (i.e. based on different spatial weights matrices), Bayesian posterior model probabilities do not require nested models to carry out these comparisons (p. 162). The basic idea is to set prior probabilities equal to 1/S, making each model equally likely a priori, to estimate each model by Bayesian methods, and then to compute posterior probabilities based on the data and the estimation results of this set of S models. Although the mathematics of this approach might deter potential users (Chs 5 and 6), my experience with this approach is positive. First, posterior model probabilities may differ widely even if the estimation results appear to be quite robust to different specifications of the spatial weights matrix. In a study I did on cross-country differences in governance <ref type="bibr">(Seldadyo et al., 2010)</ref>, the posterior model probability of a 10 nearest-neighbour matrix appeared to be more than six times as large as that of an inverse distance matrix, more than three times as large as that of a five nearestneighbour matrix, and more than twice as large as an inverse distance matrix with a cut-off point. Second, since <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="c11972c006-software-simple-1">Matlab</rs> <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="c11972c006-software-0">routines</rs> applying Bayesian methods to the spatial lag, spatial error and spatial Durbin models are made downloadable for free on <rs corresp="#c11972c006-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">LeSage</rs>'s website (<rs corresp="#c11972c006-software-0" resp="#annotator3" type="url">www.spatial-econometrics.com</rs>), these kinds of comparisons can be carried out relatively easily. Furthermore, since <rs corresp="#c11972c006-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">LeSage</rs> also provides <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="c11972c006-software-simple-6">Matlab</rs> <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="c11972c006-software-1">routines</rs> applying the Bayesian method to the spatial lag, spatial error and spatial Durbin models of limited dependent variables, similar types of selection procedures as discussed in this and the previous sections can be used for empirical problems requiring a probit or tobit approach (Ch. 10).</p>
            <p>One possible way to calculate the dispersion of the direct and indirect effects is to apply formulae for the sum, the difference, the product and the quotient of random variables (see, among others, <ref type="bibr">Mood et al., 1974, pp. 178&#193;181)</ref>. However, owing to the complexity of the matrix of partial derivatives [see <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref>] and because every empirical application will have its own unique number of observations (N) and spatial weights matrix (W), it is almost impossible to derive one general approach that can be applied under all circumstances. In order to draw inferences regarding the statistical significance of the direct and indirect effects, LeSage &amp; Pace (p. 39) therefore suggest simulating the distribution of the direct and indirect effects using the variance&#193;covariance matrix implied by the maximum likelihood estimates. <ref type="bibr">Elhorst &amp; Fr&#233;ret (2009)</ref> Using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="c11972c006-software-simple-8">Matlab</rs> <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="c11972c006-software-2">routine 'sar'</rs> posted on <rs corresp="#c11972c006-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">LeSage</rs>'s website (<rs corresp="#c11972c006-software-2" resp="#curator" type="url">www.spatial- econometrics.com</rs>), one particular parameter combination drawn from this variance&#193;covariance matrix (indexed by d ) can be obtained by:</p>

            <p>Despite these caveats and inherent uncertainty about the superiority of the bootstrap in specific settings, the availability of powerful desktop computers makes widespread use of the bootstrap very tempting. Bootstrap estimates-especially based on the paired approach-are trivial to obtain once the estimation model is specified. The statistical package <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="fc5393437f-software-simple-0">Stata</rs> has several bootstrap procedures and subroutines available in its core program, and a researcher who has never read a single <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Other useful cross-section applications, surveyed in Brownstone and Kazimi (2000), include quantile regression, discrete choice and hazard models, and frontier production function estimates. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> <ref type="bibr">Bickel and Freedman (1983)</ref> provided an early example of model-based bootstrapping for time series. Their approach has been generalized to autoregressive moving average models (Berkowitz and <ref type="bibr">Kilian, 2000; Li and Maddala, 1996)</ref> and cointegrated regression models <ref type="bibr">(Li and Maddala, 1997)</ref>. Kilian (1998a, b) considers bootstrapping vector autoregression models and applies this technique to examine international effects of monetary policy. word about the bootstrap could produce bootstrapped estimates in <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator13" type="software" xml:id="fc5393437f-software-simple-1">Stata</rs> with little difficulty. Researchers should be cautious about such casual application, because results regarding the reliability and accuracy of bootstrapped sampling distributions are not yet available for many classes of econometric models. However, while we await further results, the bootstrap can be very useful for simple applications such as estimating the sampling distributions of nonparametric statistics (for example, quantiles and percentiles of univariate distributions) or statistics with illdefined distributions (see Valletta, 1993, footnote 13, for an example).</p>

To compare the effects of the three supplements (on each outcome measure, over time), we used repeated-measures analysis of variance, and contingency table analysis, as appropriate. Cognisant that this exploratory study would likely have insufficient power for such analyses, however, we did some additional analyses. In fact, and beyond the previously reported 12-month data, <ref type="bibr">8</ref> we decided upon two strands of analysis: (a) between supplement group analysis over time: despite the small sample sizes, supplement groups were compared with each other, for changes in each outcome variable over the 3 years of the study. For interval outcome variables (MP, serum carotenoids, BCVA, CS), the method of analysis was repeatedmeasures analysis of variance, with time as a withinsubjects factor and supplement as a between-subjects factor; we used the Greenhouse-Geisser correction for lack of sphericity. Post hoc analysis, with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing, was used where appropriate. For categorical outcome variables (AMD grade), we used contingency table analysis to compare supplements; (b) within-supplement group changes in each outcome variable, over the 3 years of the study. We used paired t-tests analysis here.</p>

Here we use the best and weighted average parameter sets in bootstrap to calculate individuals' welfare without discretizing them, and then we calculate Theil's first and second indices and generalized entropy index with &#947; &#188; &#8722;1/2 using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d4e8f08ccf-software-simple-0">R package "ineq."</rs> Here we use generalized entropy index with &#947; &#188; &#8722;1/2 because the metric entropy measure we use is the same entropy metric with &#947; &#188; &#8722;1/2. The results are in <ref type="table">Table VII</ref>. The second column is the inequality in reported happiness, where happiness is a discrete variable. The third and fourth columns are inequality of welfare S calculated through the best and weighted average parameter sets in the bootstrap, using metric entropy measure 1. The fifth and sixth columns are inequality of welfare S calculated through the best and weighted average parameter sets in the bootstrap, using metric entropy measure 2. The results for discrete individual welfare are in <ref type="table">Table VIII</ref>. When we analyze inequality results, we should focus more on results from metric entropy measure 2 because it focusses on the similarity of two distributions. It is interesting to note from Tables VII and VIII, that inequality in self-reported "happiness" is always higher than that in multidimensional welfare based on entropy metric 2. One possible explanation is that this is due to the</p>

            <p>According to the orientation of the implanted neck, the cases were divided into 10 groups <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).

            <p>We propose that epigenetic changes, specifically hypermethylation of one BRCA1 allele constituted the first hit leading to inactivation of an important tumor suppressor gene and tumor initiation. Germline mutations in BRCA1 are associated with hereditary breast cancer, ovarian cancer and some other malignancies; however, so far they are generally not considered as a risk factor for childhood cancer. <ref type="bibr">28</ref> Our index patient developed precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia at the age of 4 y and 8 mo. There are only few data linking BRCA1 to hematologic malignancies. In chronic myeloid leukemia, expression of the BCR-ABL fusion protein leads to posttranscriptional downregulation of BRCA1. <ref type="bibr">29</ref> One study reported partial hypermethylation and reduced expression of BRCA1 in primary and therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia, <ref type="bibr">30</ref> whereas others did not find abnormal BRCA1 methylation in leukemia samples. <ref type="bibr">7,31</ref> In the MZ twin pair studied here, only one sister exhibited a BRCA1 epimutation in a mosaic state in multiple tissues/ cell types, whereas the unaffected twin did not. This epimutation most likely originated by a methylation error during early embryogenesis after the twinning event. It affects a substantial subset of cells derived from different embryonic cell lineages, resulting in somatic mosaicism. Genome-wide demethylation waves in the early embryo erase most germline methylation patterns, followed by de novo methylation and establishment of somatic methylation patterns. <ref type="bibr">32</ref> Most constitutive epimutations may occur during this vulnerable time window, where epigenetic genome reprogramming occurs, and represent stochastic and/or environmentally induced errors in the establishment or maintenance of an epigenetic state. <ref type="bibr">33</ref>For classic bisulfite plasmid sequencing BRCA1 PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector using T4-DNA ligase, the TA cloning kit and One Shot TOP10 chemically competent Escherichia coli (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA of individual clones was isolated with the ZR Plasmid Miniprep Classic Kit (Zymo Research, Freiburg, Germany). Insert-containing clones were sequenced using dye terminator cycle sequencing with M13 primers on an ABI 3130xl automated sequencer. Sequences were analyzed with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="f90d27947b-software-simple-0">BiQ Analyzer</rs> software tool. <ref type="bibr">46</ref> Protein expression analyses. Cells were resuspended two times in 500 &#956;l of 10 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM KCl, pH 7.9 and incubated on ice for 10 min. After 10 sec centrifugation at maximum speed the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 100 &#956;l of 20 mM HEPES, 0.42 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.2 mM EDTA, 25% glycerol, pH 7.9 and homogenized. After incubation on ice for 30 min and centrifugation for 30 min at maximum speed at 4&#176;C, the supernatant containing the nuclear protein extract was separated from ATM-dependent mechanism and, on the other hand, essential for the recruitment of previously activated ATM to the sites of DNA damage. <ref type="bibr">42</ref> Although we cannot exclude the formal possibility of a chance coincidence or a late (i.e., therapy-related) somatic event, it is plausible to assume that epigenetic silencing of one copy of the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene in 25% body cells and differences in the DNA damage response contributed to the discordant cancer phenotype in the affected twin. Preliminary evidence suggests that BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation can also be found in blood cells of a subset of breast cancer patients. <ref type="bibr">43,44</ref> Collectively, these results suggest that constitutive BRCA1 epimutations occur in normal tissues and may be associated with an increased cancer risk. Our pyrosequencing assay may prove useful for high-throughput screening of larger patient populations.</p>

The quintile values of serum bilirubin in the 1, 208 subjects were 0.6 mg/dL, 0.8 mg/dL, 1.0 mg/dL, and 1.1 mg/dL and we grouped the subjects according to the highest quintile value of serum bilirubin 1.1 mg/dL. Differences in proportions among the subject groups were compared by the Pearson's chi-square test. Group differences for continuous variables were assessed by the Student t-test. We defined the event period as the duration from the date of the first health check-up to the date when subjects had become hypertensive during follow-up health check-up (s). We compared the cumulative incidence of hypertension between the bilirubin groups by Log-rank test. To determine whether the bilirubin category was associated independently with the incidence of hypertension, we used Cox's proportional hazard model adjusted for serum albumin and univariate risk factors for the development of hypertension. We checked the violation of the proportional hazard assumption by partial residual plot against time for each covariate and log minus log plots (LML) for categorical covariates, such as bilirubin group. The average values of residuals for covariates includ-Selected 1,208 subjects, aged more than 18 yr, who did not take anti-hypertensive medicine, SBP less than 120 mmHg, and DBP less than 80 mmHg at the fist examinationed in Cox's model were zero and the LML for each categorical variable was parallel. Two-sided p values are reported, with 0.05 taken as the level of statistical significance. All data are shown as mean&#177;standard deviation or frequency per observation.</p>

Structural model selection was driven by the data and was based on evaluation of goodness-of-fit plots (observed vs. predicted concentrations, weighted residuals vs. predicted values or time, histograms of individual random effects etc.), successful convergence, plausibility and precision of parameter estimates and the minimum objective function value (OFV).</p>
            <p>A prediction corrected visual predictive check <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref> (PC-VPC) was performed for the final PK model. Five hundred data sets were simulated using the final model parameters, covariates, sampling times and dosing histories. Both the observed and the model predicted individual concentration values were normalized by the population prediction of the same time point. Non-parametric bootstrap analysis was also performed by generating 1000 data sets through random sampling with replacement from the original data using the individual as the sampling unit. No stratification was implemented during the random sampling. Population parameters of the final model for each data set were estimated using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a90d4f8d1d-software-simple-2">NONMEM</rs> and empirical 95% CIs were constructed.</p>

            <p>After fasting for least 6 h, patients were administered 370 MBq of 18 F-FDG intravenously. All patients were instructed to rest comfortably for 60 min and to urinate before scanning. Wholebody PET-CT images were obtained with a Discovery ST scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). Seven to eight frames (3 min per frame) of emission PET data were acquired in 3D mode after a non-contrast CT scan from the base of the skull to the upper thigh (tube rotation time of 1 s per revolution, 120 kV, 60 mA, 7.5 mm per rotation and an acquisition time of 60.9 s for a scan length of 867 mm). Emission PET images were reconstructed using an iterative method (ordered-subsets expectation maximization with 2 iterations and 30 subsets; field of view, 600 mm; slice thickness, 3.27 mm) and attenuation corrected with noncontrast CT. Two nuclear medicine physicians reviewed 18 F-FDG PET-CT images on an <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="ecc2404bb9-software-0">AW workstation</rs> (v. <rs corresp="#ecc2404bb9-software-0" resp="#annotator5" type="version">4.4</rs>; <rs corresp="#ecc2404bb9-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">GE Healthcare</rs>, Milwaukee, WI) by consensus. Focal 18 F-FDG uptake with intensity higher than that of normal background soft tissue on PET image was considered to be positive for metastasis. CT images were used for anatomic localization, but not for decision making. For the semi-quantitative analysis of <ref type="bibr">18</ref> F-FDG uptake, standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated based on injected dose and body weight. Circular regions of interest were placed on the ALN and maximum SUVs (SUV max ) were recorded.

            <p>Histological analysis. Mice were sacrificed at day 28 (for acute EAE) or day 120 (for chronic EAE) p.i. and transcardially perfused with PBS. Brain and lumbar spinal cords were harvested for pathological assessment and spleen for immunological assessment. CNS tissues were cut into 7 &#956;m sections, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) for assessment of inflammation and Luxol fast blue (LFB) for demyelination.

Fixed tissues were embedded in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek, Sakura Finetek, Japan) for frozen sections and then sectioned coronally at 12 &#956;m. Transverse sections of brain and spinal cord were cut, and stained with different antibodies. Immunofluorescence controls were routinely generated by omitting primary antibodies. Results were visualized by fluorescent microscopy (Nikon Eclipse E600; Nikon, Melville, NY) or confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510; Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). For the quantifications of HE, FB, iNOS + Iba1 + , Arg1 + Iba1 + , APP + , GFAP + and MBP + , ten areas in the white matter at the lumbar spinal cord were selected <ref type="figure">(Supplementary Figure S3)</ref>.</p>
            <p>For surface-marker staining, cells were incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated Abs to CD4, CD8, CD11b, and CD11c (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) or isotype control Abs for 30 minutes on ice. For intracellular staining, splenocytes or CNS-infiltrating MNCs were stimulated with 25 and 10 &#956;g/ml MOG peptide for 72 hours or overnight, respectively, followed by stimulation with 50 ng/ml PMA and 500 ng/ml ionomycin in the presence of GolgiPlug for 5 hours. Cells were surfacestained with mAbs against CD4 and CD8. Cells were then washed, fixed, and permeabilized with FIX&amp;PERM solution (Invitrogen), and intracellular cytokines were stained with Abs against IL-17, IFN-&#947;, or GM-CSF (BD Biosciences).

            <p>Since D(1) is the lower triangular, the long-run multipliers from Aot, AYt, Art7, and it -n to Aht are zero, so the coefficients of their lags each sum to zero. Imposing these constraints yieldsThe variables considered in our model are total hours worked (ht), output (yt), inflation (rr,), the nominal interest rate (it), and real oil prices (or). The Appendix gives the details of the sources of the data. Estimates reported in this paper are based on quarterly U.S. data from 1951:1. Data before 1951 are used as initial conditions in autoregressions. The end of the sample period is discussed below. The data for labor hours, output, and price are for the nonfarm private economy, excluding housing. We choose output for the nonfarm, non-housing private sector, rather than the whole economy because there are serious conceptual difficulties in relating the output to the inputs of housing, government, and farms. Housing and government are imputed in the national accounts. Farmers are largely 12. In the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="bb53f0a4b5-software-simple-0">RATS</rs> packages, the equations can be estimated without including the disturbances and then transformed via the standard Cholesky decomposition. This decomposition picks out a different linear combination of the aggregate demand shocks, but since only their joint effect is identified, this difference is inessential. 13. <ref type="bibr">Blanchard and Quah (1988)</ref> use a different technique to estimate models subject to these long-run Wold causal orderings. They estimate the unrestricted vector autoregression for X, and then transform the system by post-multiplying the VAR by a matrix that imposes the necessary restrictions on the long-run multipliers and the residual covariance matrix.</p>

To the extent that BITs act as a means of substituting for weak domestic institutions in the host, then we would expect that multinational firms concerned about weak domestic institutions would not invest (or would withdraw previous investments) in that country without the protection of a BIT. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> For more information on the difference between these estimators, see <ref type="bibr">Wooldridge (2002)</ref> and the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="f8f8887979-software-simple-0">Stata</rs> help file for psmatch2. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> In particular, this gives an estimate of the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), which in our case gives the expected impact of new-BIT membership on FDI flows for a randomly drawn country-pair in the subsample of countrypairs that actually entered into a BIT agreement. Note that the ATT can be obtained from a weighted least squares regression, where the weights for the untreated observations correspond to the weights used in the construction of the control group. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> Myburgh and Paniagua (2016) use a similar approach and find a BIT reduces (raises) FDI levels below (above) the median.</p>

            <p>Rituximab-binding analysis was performed according to our previously developed imaging-based procedure, with some modifications. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Briefly, approximately ten thousands cells of purified living lymphoma cells using a Dead cell removal kit (Miltenyi Biotec) were incubated with 10 mg/ml of anti-CD19 mAb labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) and rituximab labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 4 1C. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline two times and were then suspended in 4 ml of RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 mg/ ml of Hoechist 33 342. The cell suspension was pipetted into a well made of silicon, 2.5 mm in diameter and 2 mm in depth, on a piece of cover glass. Images were collected by means of an OLYMPUS PlanApo &#194; 60 oil objective in an OLYMPUS FV-1000 confocal microscope (OLYMPUS). The fluorophore was excited by laser at 405, 488 or 633 nm. The cells were optically sectioned along the z-axis, and the images were collected at 640 &#194; 640 pixel resolution in a sequential mode to minimize the crossover between channels. The step size in the z-axis was 0.5 mm. For three-dimensional reconstruction, twodimensional confocal stacks were saved in an Olympus.oib format and three-dimensional images were generated using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="f086b414fd-software-0">Fluoview</rs> software (<rs corresp="#f086b414fd-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">OLYMPUS</rs>).</p>

            <p>Huberty <ref type="formula">(2014)</ref> focuses on what resides in the cloud, big data-large volumes of rapidly accumulating data of various kinds that registers information about individuals' behavior online. He suggests that big data is in its infancy and in order for it to live up to its commercial promise, certain shortcomings have to be first acknowledged and then addressed. He defines and challenges four previously unstated assumptions underlying big data: (1) all the individuals one cares about are included in the data, (2) one is able to identify the individuals of interest, (3) online behavior is consistent with offline behavior, and (4) individuals' representation of themselves are consistent over time. Strictly speaking, none of these four assumptions is true. Huberty defines three orders of viable big data business models. The first two of these are already well-known: the third-order business model is in essence online advertising; the second-order business model is online retailing. Huberty argues that the real changes will come from the first-order business models that are deeply embedded in, and reliant upon, data generated from and around real-world phenomena. Here, he cites products such as Nest thermostats that utilize direct home appliance data to make valuable decisions or the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="ecb42a8c5d-software-simple-0">Google Translate</rs> function that provides a big data service directly. He believes that these types of applications are where the true value of big data can be realized. <ref type="bibr">Kushida (2014)</ref> concentrates on the politics of ICT commoditization, i.e., he argues that national-level political and socio-economical dynamics influenced the rapid disruptions experienced by global ICT industries. His analysis suggests that local regulatory and technology choices played critical roles in shaping globally disruptive business models driving commoditization. Thus, global industry disruptions are shaped by a set of local political bargains particularly in the early stages of technological trajectories. In the context of mobile telecommunications, operators won the early political fights in Japan and equipment manufacturers in Europe, but eventually US-based computing-centric leaders emerged and ultimately commoditized all other players, both domestically and internationally. Even though-in the context of ICT-technological opportunities have been largely symmetric and we are often compelled to study variations in business strategies in an effort to explain competitive outcomes, Kushida's observations suggest that the underlying trajectories of global competition were shaped by national political dynamics.</p>

            <p>Many sRNAs act on gene expression by base pairing to target mRNAs and influencing either the stability of these targets or the rate of translation or both. To get a hint on possible targets of SorY we compared the transcriptomes of a control strain harbouring an empty vector (2.4.1pBBR) and of the overexpressing strain (2.4.1pBBRSorYi) after 10 min of 1 O 2 stress by microarray analysis <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1)</ref>. From 3976 genes with a reliable A-value 17 protein coding genes showed a log 2 fold change of &gt; 0.6 or &lt; &#161;0.6 between the 2 strains <ref type="table">Table 1)</ref>. Putative interaction of the mRNAs transcribed from these genes and SorY were predicted by the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f0bb4d7298-software-simple-0">IntaRNA</rs> tool. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the predicted parameters of genes with expression changes for which an energy value of less than &#161;10 kcal/mol was calculated for a putative interaction. The effect of SorY on mRNA levels was confirmed by real time RT-PCR for RSP_2400, RSP_0097, sufC, and adhI <ref type="figure">Fig. 2A)</ref>. The microarray data for flgF could not be confirmed and RSP_0432 was not tested, since no function for this gene is predicted. Real time RT-PCR also demonstrated that deletion of SorY had an opposite effect on the transcript levels of these mRNAs than overexpression of SorY <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2A)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Microarray analysis was performed as described before <ref type="bibr">(Mank et al., 2012)</ref>. Total RNA, obtained from aerobically grown cultures of strains 2.4.1pBBRSorYi and 2.4.1pBBR after 10 min of photooxidative stress, was chemically labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 (Kreatech; EA-022/EA-023), respectively.

On the basis of calculated MA plots, genes were considered reliable if the average signal intensity [A-value: 1/2 log2 (Cy3&#163;Cy5)] was 12. To filter out potentially insignificant changes among genes that passed the reliability criterion, a cutoff value was applied; i.e., those genes were retained whose average expression value of 2.4.1pBBRSorYi (a) compared with the average value of the control treatment 2.4.1pBBR (b) was either a log2 Fold Change of 0.6 or a &#161;0.6.

Average ORs and P-values jointly analyzed from both the Hong Kong Chinese and the Thai populations were obtained by CMH test of association conditional on SNP differences between the two populations. Potential heterogeneity of ORs for a given SNP between the two populations was tested both by Breslow -Day test and by partitioning the x 2 statistic between the two populations. Test of independent contribution of a SNP controlling for the effect of other SNPs in the same gene was done by logistic regression as well as haplotype analyses. Association with subphenotype was analyzed by comparing cases with a certain subphenotype with controls, cases without the subphenotype with controls, heterogeneity test of two ORs so derived and direct comparison of the cases with and without the subphenotypes.</p>

            <p>The radio-transmission pH-measurement system consists of a wireless pH sensor, a data measurement receiver, a relay unit and a personal computer with special software (<rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" type="software" xml:id="b01629738a-software-0">YCOW-S</rs>; <rs corresp="#b01629738a-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">DKK-Toa Yamagata</rs>) <ref type="bibr">(Sato et al. 2012b)</ref> installed. The wireless system utilized a specified low-power radio transmission system (429 MHz band), which could be operated without a license in accordance with Japanese Radio Law. The mean variations of the measurements by the glass pH electrode were + 0.20 after 2 months of continuous recording, compared to the values confirmed by a standard pH solution at the start of the recording. The mean lifetime of the internal battery was 3 months when measurements were continuously transmitted every 10 min. There was a good correlation between continuous recording and spot sampling (r = 0.986, P &lt; 0.01), when the ruminal pH recorded by our new system was compared to that of the spot sampling of ruminal fluid <ref type="bibr">(Sato et al. 2012b)</ref>. We have demonstrated the possible application of the radio-transmission pH-measurement system for assessment and monitoring of the ruminal pH in cows. Our new system might contribute to accurate assessment and prevention of SARA. In this chapter, our experimental results of basic tests for performance of radiotransmission pH-measurement system are described.</p>

            <p>Quantitative coronary angiography was performed using standard quantitative analyses and definitions. <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref> A main principle of our QCA approach was to ensure as little observer interference as possible. Angiograms obtained at baseline and before MV stenting were analyzed with the use of a computer-based system dedicated to bifurcation analysis (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dc54f3b199-software-0">Qangio XA</rs>, version <rs corresp="#dc54f3b199-software-0" resp="#curator" type="version">7.3</rs>, <rs corresp="#dc54f3b199-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Medis</rs>, Leiden, the Netherlands). We obtained quantitative angiographic measurements of the four segments of the bifurcation lesion: The proximal MV segment, the distal MV segment, the SB segment and the bifurcation core segment <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>]. Bifurcation core is defined as the central part of the bifurcation which begins where the common vessel starts to split into two branches and ends at the carinal point, <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> which area was calculated by the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="dc54f3b199-software-simple-3">Qangio XA</rs> software. We also obtained the bifurcation angle (the angle between the distal MV and the SB) from the analysis system.</p>
            <p>Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of SB occlusion. The covariates that were either statistically significant on univariate analysis (P &lt; 0.25) or considered important were included in the multivariate model. Totally, 28 covariates were employed in the multivariate model, including diabetes, previous PCI, medina classification, plaque location,reference diameter of the proximal and distal MV, reference diameter of the SB, preprocedural percent diameter stenosis of the proximal MV, preprocedural percent diameter stenosis of the distal MV, true bifurcation lesions, lesion length of the MV and SB, bifurcation angle, predilation of the SB and jailed wire in SB. Estimates of the adjusted differences in risks are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the difference. All P values were two-tailed, and a P &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

            <p>The cell cycle, circadian clock and relative phase. Recent studies have shown that the circadian clock is coupled to the cell cycle processes through clockcontrolled genes, which may contain E-box or ROR elements in their promoters. Somewhat surprisingly, although we found that deregulation of PER2 has a strong effect on the induced transformation of MEFs and tumorigenesis; the gene expression changes in these clock-controlled genes are less profound in Per2 allele mutant MEFs. This leads us to think about their phase implication. Although the Nr1d1 transcripts displayed obvious phase shift and period length changes in these mutant MEFS, p21 transcripts displayed fixed 24-h-period oscillation with phase delay to the same extent, leading to a similar phase to that of Cyclin D. It indicates that in the wide-type MEFs, the opposite phases of p21 and Cyclin D are a result of coordination between circadian clock and cell cycle, with circadian clock adjusting transcription phase of p21 and the main driver of cell cycle. With the interaction of PER2, NR1D1 may be a critical circadian factor in exerting the phase adjusting function. At present, the physiological significance of the altered phases of these genes is unclear, and the phase shifting cannot explain all the phenotypes that are seen in these mutant mice. It is likely that modifier relative phases between the cycle genes influence features such as the number of transformation foci and the development of the tumor-associated fibroblasts. One of the possibilities comes from interfering with phase locking. Oscillation-based synchrony is the most energyefficient physical mechanism for temporal coordination. It occurs in many biological systems, including two oscillators of cell division and the circadian phase <ref type="bibr">31</ref> or within a cell cycle oscillator through multiple regulatory interactions. <ref type="bibr">32</ref> mutants 33 by crossing with p53 R175H/ &#254; mice.

            <p>available in AEA's Econlit and other databases. Each article in every Elsevier journal is provided with a citation history (cited by) building up over time, so it is possible to see how an article was later cited within the ScienceDirect journals.</p>
            <p>ScienceDirect license agreements are individually tailored to the needs of participating universities and consortia of libraries. Depending upon the additional desired contents and functionalities, there is a maximum surcharge of 15 percent. It is becoming clear through such collaborations that Elsevier journals are increasingly used by readers. Thomas Sanville (2001), Executive Director of OhioLINK, has recently described their experience over four years with the usage of electronic journals. In that article, he provides an independent description of the real-life experience of libraries in an electronic consortium for the state of Ohio and, supported by facts and figures, probes the value element of electronic resource sharing within library consortia.</p>
            <p>There are also significant savings in administration and storage for a library that licenses ScienceDirect. (On average, a library spends less than 30 percent of its total budget on journal/book material; over 70 percent goes to staff and the costs associated with housing, staff and administering the collection). Moreover, the essay does not factor in the significant benefits in convenience and time for faculty and students arising from the availability of all Elsevier journals from one electronic platform on the basis of IP-domain recognition.

The effectiveness and usage patterns of the automated insulin management features of the MiniMed 640G system, in addition to specific MiniMed Paradigm Veo and MiniMed 530G comparator data, were evaluated.For this retrospective analysis, users were not provided specific instruction from healthcare professionals on when or how long to use system features or how often to calibrate systems with self-monitored blood glucose measurements. Voluntarily uploaded and anonymized data were captured from <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator25" type="software" xml:id="e21e522056-software-simple-2">CareLink</rs> software. To compare SG trajectories associated with different types of pump suspension, user-days were assigned to the feature (i.e., predictive ''suspend before low'' or reactive ''suspend on low'') in use during that day. The threshold range for the MiniMed 640G ''suspend before low'' and ''suspend on low'' was 50-90 mg/dL (3.3-5.0 mmol/L). The threshold range for the MiniMed Paradigm Veo system was 40-110 mg/dL (2.2-6.1 mmol/L) and that for the MiniMed 530G was 60-90 mg/dL (2.8-5.0 mmol/L). While the MiniMed Paradigm Veo LGS and the MiniMed 530G TS features differ in suspend threshold range, they are considered functionally equivalent. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> For simplicity, the threshold suspend features in all three systems have been referred to as ''suspend on low''. Pump suspension events were characterized according to whether insulin delivery was resumed automatically or manually. Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia were defined as SG values &#163;70 mg/dL (&#163;3.9 mmol/L) and 240-300 mg/dL (13.3-16.7 mmol/L), respectively, and were compared across systems using a Kruskal-Wallis analysis. Severe hyperglycemia was defined as &#8225;300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L). Hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic excursions were defined as &#8225;2 consecutive hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic SG values per day or night (8:00 PM-8:00 AM) and, in addition to area under the glucose concentration-time curve (AUC), were compared between the MiniMed Paradigm Veo and MiniMed 640G systems using a Wilcoxon signed-rank analysis.</p>
            <p>This study benefits from the large number of users and user-days available for analyses, although data from system users who did not upload to <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator25" type="software" xml:id="e21e522056-software-simple-3">CareLink</rs> software were unavailable. A limitation of the study is that the MiniMed 640G ''suspend on low'' versus MiniMed 640G ''suspend before low'' data could not be analyzed, due to an insufficient number of events during use of the former feature. The lack of detailed user demographic information is another limitation, as is a lack of detailed information regarding user-system interface (e.g., calibrations, sensor changes, and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e21e522056-software-simple-4">CareLink</rs> software upload frequency), physician-touser instructions, and dietary and exercise behaviors. The false-positive rate of predictive pump suspensions, as well as sensor accuracy, could not be assessed because of the study's retrospective nature. The effect of sensor life on the rate of pump suspension events was also not possible to assess. Within-user comparisons of MiniMed Paradigm Veo and MiniMed 640G system use may have been influenced by the unidirectional nature of the MiniMed Paradigm Veo system use preceding MiniMed 640G system use, and by uncharacterized or unknown behaviors related to becoming familiar with a new pump system.</p>

Responses for each question on the survey were first compared between the English and Spanish surveys. We analyzed differences between language groups as categorical variables using a Chi-squared test. When the assumptions of the Chi-squared test were not met, a Fisher's exact test was used. For this analysis, questions 1 and 20-24 were analyzed as continuous variables and compared between language groups using a two-sample t-test. Because 47 comparisons were made, we used a significance threshold of p&lt;0.0001 for all comparisons.</p>

               <title>Chap. iii on " The Canal and the Length and Time of Ocean Voyages" saved by the canal is very instructive in this forecast, as is chap. xi on "Fuel Supplies and Costs via the Panama Canal and Alternative Routes." Generally speaking, the economy resulting from the shortening of ocean routes is indicated by the number of days saved in making voyages. But whether a longer or a shorter route is selected depends on two things: the traffic obtainable and the presence or absence of coaling stations along the route, together with the price of coal at these stations. These factors are carefully analyzed in chaps. x and xi and reduced to conclusions which are readily grasped. These chapters, with chap. ix on " Europe's Interest in the Panama Canal," which explains the competition which has been afforded between New England merchants and certain European merchants in the Orient, bring the international features to the front and aid in laying a basis for calculating the effect of the opening of the waterway on the world's trade and more specifically on the Pacific Ocean. These chapters are among the best in the book</title>

Perhaps, after all, this book will achieve its most useful result by showing how far we fall short of that adequate objective knowledge upon which alone, in Dr. Wood's contention, discussion of militarism and pacifism can probably be based</title>
